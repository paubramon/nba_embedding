            According to ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski, Jaren Jackson Jr. had a ""monster"" workout for the Suns on Sunday.
        
        
             This was the first workout Jackson Jr. has attended and it's not a surprise that he's turning some heads. JJJ doesn't even turn 19 until September and you can argue that he has the highest ceiling in the draft with per-40 minute averages of 20.0 points, 10.6 boards, 2.0 assists, 1.1 steals, 5.5 blocks and 2.0 treys with great shooting percentages. Wojnarowski adds that there are a number of teams outside of the Top four that are looking to move up to acquire JJJ, and it sounds like he's firmly in play anywhere from No. 1 to No. 4.

            Thaddeus Young is ""seriously contemplating"" declining his player option worth $13.7 million for the 2018-19 season, according to sources of Adrian Wojnarowski.
        
        
             This report jives with an earlier report from J. Micheal of the Indianapolis Star, with the reasoning being that the 29-year-old vet would like to hit the open market now while he's still in his prime in hopes of locking up a long-term deal. Young wasn't overwhelmingly impressive this past season with averages of 11.8 points, 6.3 boards and 1.7 steals per game, but he did serve in a leadership role on a young Pacers' team that took LeBron James' Cavs to seven games in the first-round, and his ability to guard multiple positions is attractive in the current NBA landscape.

            Abdel Nader underwent right wrist arthroscopy and ulnar osteotomy and he's expected to return to basketball activities in 2-3 months.
        
        
             Nader initially fractured his right wrist in high school and apparently, it never healed properly as it was giving him some issues this past season. Nader will assuredly miss summer league, but he should be good to go for training camp. He's a non-factor in fantasy hoops, though.

He's reportedly expected to be pursued by seven other teams, but the Spurs will have the ability to match any offer he receives on the open market.

             The Hawks own the No. 3 overall pick in the 2018 draft, which would be a bit of a reach for Young, but if they like what they see they might consider moving down a few slots. Young put in averages of 27.4 points, 3.7 triples, 8.7 dimes, 1.7 steals and 5.2 turnovers per game on 42.2% shooting during his one-and-done season with the Sooners, so he could be a fantasy relevant guy during his rookie season depending on where he winds up.

The back-to-back Finals MVP will be 30 in September, so if he signs a five-year deal for the max this offseason that could be his last contract. As for his life after basketball, KD said he's been entertaining the idea of owning an NBA franchise.

He could be drafted anywhere from No. 1 to No. 6, and a ""number of teams"" have explored the idea of trading up to grab him.

             Young signed a cheap deal with the Warriors to chase a ring, but only played meaninful minutes because of Patrick McCaw's injury and Golden State's lack of depth on the wings. He shot just 30.2% from the field and 29.8% from the 3-point line during the postseason, averaging just 2.6 points. Heading into his age-34 season, Young will likely try to latch onto a different contender for the minimum.

It's unclear if the Pelicans will re-sign DeMarcus Cousins and they are talking up Cheick Diallo quite a bit, but we'd still expect the Pelicans to bring Okafor back as emergency depth -- he's only on the books for a non-guaranteed $2.4 million.

Despite leading the Raptors to a 59-21 record and winning the Coach of the Year Award, Casey was fired just a few days after Toronto's playoff exit. Vince Ellis of the Detroit Press notes that Casey has a strong reputation for player development, so this hire could be good news for Stanley Johnson, Luke Kennard and Henry Ellenson. Ownership expects the Pistons to reach the playoffs in 2018-19, so hiring Casey was the right call.

            Kyrie Irving was non-committal when asked about his long-term future with the Celtics, saying he's ""just going into [2018-19] with the mindset of trying to win a championship.""
        
        
             To be clear, Irving did not say he wants to leave as a free agent in 2019. He was merely equivocal, but it doesn't help that a recent report by Yahoo's Chris Mannix suggests the Celts are ""scared"" he might ultimately bolt. Of course, this may not mean anything if they march to the Finals with him at the helm this year.

He'll be 32 years old when the season starts and has no clear role on the rebuilding Nets, who have Jarrett Allen at center, but it's hard to see any team taking on his guaranteed $32.7 million salary through 2020.

McDonough also mentioned that he'd entertain moving down in the draft ""if there are teams that want to blow us away with an offer,"" but quickly added that such a scenario was ""unlikely."" Doncic remains one of the most intriguing variables with the draft looming on June 21.

             Chris Paul is a big factor here, as he's very close with LeBron James and was quoted saying he was already recruiting LBJ once the Rockets got bounced out of the Western Conference Finals. Daryl Morey would need to move around some contracts to make the numbers work, but it wouldn't be impossible for him to add James to the core of James Harden, CP3 and Clint Capela. James could also partner up with Paul in Los Angeles, or he could go to San Antonio to play under a coach he's openly admired.

Walker is an explosive athlete who is excellent at working off the ball, but he can be streaky on the offensive end and needs to improve as a ball handler. Bridges, at 6-foot-9 is a bit undersized at the four-spot, but he makes up for that with his raw athleticism and he's also got a nice 3-point stroke.

             Williams finished the 2016-17 campaign averaging 11.0 points, 5.6 assists and 2.3 rebounds in 25.9 minutes. However, he did not play at all last season. He will turn 34 next month and it's unlikely we see him in an NBA uniform in 2018-19.

            The Cavs hosted a draft workout for Alabama guard Collin Sexton on Saturday.
        
        
             After the Cavs were swept, they're already looking to the future with their No. 8 pick from the Kyrie Irving deal. Sexton has met with a handful of lottery teams and is more of a defense-first guy with his 6'7"" wingspan. The Alabama product is expected to go in the top 10.

            If LeBron James leaves Cleveland, the Cavs would ""fully make Kevin Love available"" in a trade, according to ESPN's Brian Windhorst.
        
        
             That makes sense because the Cavs would almost certainly have a one-way ticket to the lottery. Plus, the Cavs have a top-10 protection on their first-round pick that would go to Atlanta, so a tank job to keep the pick for the next two seasons adds some incentive to gut the roster. If the Cavs do keep Love, he'd have terrific fantasy value. However, that seems unlikely, which makes him a mid-round pick in drafts.

             There's a very good chance that Hawks take the MSU product at No. 3. Jackson is a modern NBA five with his 6'10"" height, 7'5"" wingspan, and making 2.0 treys in his freshman season. Jackson Jr. also said at the combine he wants to get into broadcasting after his NBA career, and he's already shown he should be a treat to cover. For fantasy, the appeal is certainly there with a Mo Bamba-like upside for blocks while adding a little bit of everything. He'll likely be a top-100 pick in standard drafts.

             He also made the popular comparison to Rudy Gobert. ""At 20 he's ahead of where Rudy was,"" McDonough said. The GM isn't wrong here because Gobert was about as raw as it gets at his first summer league, but both possess otherworldly wingspans and Bamba has an edge at 7'10"". The Suns likely won't take Bamba at No. 1, but he seems like a near lock to go in the top five.

His 43 points in Game 3, carrying the Warriors to a road win while Stephen Curry had a terrible shooting night really secured the award for him. Durant will be back with the Dubs next year looking to be the first team to three-peat since the Lakers in 2000-2002. As he continues to dominate, he would certainly be an asset for your fantasy squad in 2018-19.

            Stephen Curry scored 37 points, making seven 3-pointers and had six rebounds, four assists, three steals and three blocks in Game 4 against Cleveland on Friday.
        
        
             He came back on fire making his first three shots and scoring nine of the Warriors first 13 points after struggling in Game 3. Curry ended the first half with 20 points, tied for the most in a first half in his Finals career. He was certainly in the running for MVP, but Durant just played too well throughout and Steph was a no show in Game 3. Either way, he added a third title to his resume and will be back next year looking to build on the already dominant Warriors dynasty. As usual, he's projected to be one of the top fantasy players for 2018-19.

             He was limping a little in the first quarter and he had a brutal start with a scoreless first half. However, Klay came out hot in the third with 10 points in that frame, which is nothing new for this team as they put the Cavs to bed in the third by a 25-13 advantage. The Warriors put up an incredible +524 in the third this season and that was a major storyline in the postseason. China Klay gets his third NBA title and you can bet he'll be enjoying it this summer.

             He had a major impact in the first half with three 3-pointers. Surprisingly, he only had three games with 3-plus treys this season and he ranked dead last among the 330 players with at least 20 unguarded catch-and-shoot jumpers in halfcourt (Synergy). Iguodala continues to be a key role player on the Warriors, but his career arc could take a downward turn as he'll turn 35 next season and has dealt with numerous leg injuries. Iggy is making a case for the Hall of Fame with three titles and a Finals MVP on his resume.

             After his second NBA Finals sweep, the focus now shifts to where James will end up this offseason, especially after James talked so much about how Kevin Durant joining the Warriors made such a big impact. Brian Windhorst reported that ""everything is on the table"" when it comes to his free agency, and Vegas' odds suggest he is gone. With LeBron going into his 16th season and a lack of a strong supporting cast in Cleveland, it almost feels like he has one foot out the door but did receive a standing ovation and MVP chants as he checked out of the game for a final time. Without a doubt, this will be the biggest story in the offseason.

             He talked about how bad he played in Game 3 and then came out and performed like this. Hill never really had a breakout game during these playoffs and only shot 37.5% from the field in this series. He’s set to be back with the Cavaliers in 2018-19, but that could be a very different team by the time opening night rolls around.

             This was his first game of this series that he didn’t score at least 20 points and get a double-double. Love played hard and brought an intensity all series, but it just wasn’t enough against the Dubs. With LeBron James future in question, Kevin Love’s future is also in question as he could be on the trading block were the Cavaliers to do major retools to their roster. As it stands now though, he’s set to be back in 2018-19 and should still be considered a solid fantasy asset when healthy.

             The C's currently have the 27th pick which would be in the area Allen could possibly go. Danny Ainge said they've narrowed their list of players to pick to about 10, but they have worked out about 60. Some claim he was a dirty player in college but when teams have addressed this he said they see it as ""competitiveness."" Boston had great success with another former Blue Devil in Jayson Tatum so could try for more another with Allen. He likely won't be in the rotation to start the year and isn't on the fantasy radar yet.

             This was pretty much a no-brainer for Shumpert. He played just 14 games last season and didn't even play with the Kings after they traded for him in February. The Kings will be rebuilding again next year, so the 27-year-old guard likely won't be in the rotation at multiple points of the season.

             First, we have to add that this report comes from someone who hasn't exactly been kind to the Bulls over the years, so keep that in mind. Plus, President John Paxson said Dunn will return as the starting point guard back in April. That aside, this is interesting to hear at this point of the year, and maybe Dunn missing so much time late in the year has influenced the Bulls front office. Dunn should still be considered the heavy favorite to start on opening night, but don't be shocked if the Bulls go with another PG at No. 7 in the draft.

             He’s almost a lock to go in the top five, and Bagley even said it was ""disrespectful"" for so many to assume DeAndre Ayton would go first in the draft. The Duke product also made a point to say that he’s a four and a five on the court, but Suns GM Ryan McDonough said he viewed Bagley as a four. Bagley grew up in the Phoenix area and added that he would probably hold a lifetime grudge if the Suns pass on him. He’ll likely have appealing fantasy value because he’ll be on a bad team next year and has a high offensive ceiling.

             He's going to turn 33 the day before free agency starts, and Ariza has been making money in the league since 2004. Ariza would have to fit into the mid-level exception for the Warriors, which means he likely wouldn't be able to match his $7.4 million from last year even with the salary cap increase. If Houston reels in a big fish, Ariza could want to join a title contender.

             President Pat Riley has said that nobody is untouchable, but Dragic, Bam Adebayo and Josh Richardson appear to be the safest of the bunch. Dragic is not going to take part in European action this summer as his career heads into his mid 30s.

            According to Barry Jackson of the Miami Herald, it's ""considered 50-50 at best"" that the Heat can trade Hassan Whiteside.
        
        
             The report adds it's likely because his trade value is so low. That makes sense because of how Whiteside wasn't closing games and how he had trouble staying healthy last season. Additionally, Jackson adds that a friend of Whiteside has said that the center hasn't asked for a trade. It would appear the Heat will try to trade Whiteside, but it may be tough to find a trade partner. His fantasy value has taken a big hit in the last 12 months.

             Adrian Wojnarowski of ESPN reported earlier this week that the Spurs currently have zero interest in trading away Leonard. However, per Garcia, if the Spurs and Leonard are not able to agree to a new contract, San Antonio may be willing to consider moving Kawhi prior to the start of next season. This will be one of the more interesting storylines of the summer.

Mannix believes that Irving landing in New York is a possibility. ""I think they're scared,"" said Mannix on his podcast. ""I think they're scared and should be scared to some degree of Kyrie Irving walking in 2019. I know he had a great year, but you know there are people in Cleveland that will tell you that the Knicks should be considered a real threat for Kyrie Irving. Because Kyrie had talked about it, about playing with the Knicks with some players in that Cleveland locker room from what I was told.""

             Porter Jr. was the top-ranked player in the country at this time last year, but had back surgery (a microdiscectomy of his L3-L4 spinal discs) in November, which obviously makes projecting his NBA future more complicated. Still, it's highly unlikely he slips out of the top-10. The fact that he is willing to share his physical with any team that asks would seem to imply that he is confident it proves he is now healthy.

Holiday is a defense-first point guard, which the Suns desperately need after ranking dead last in defense last season and in the bottom five in each of the last three. Holiday could possibly compete with Tyler Ulis for the starting job.

General manager John Hammond is known for being obsessed with length from his Milwaukee days, so Young being the smallest top prospect could mean the Magic will look elsewhere. Additionally, Hammond did have dinner with Young on Wednesday night.

In the final two minutes, he had a monster dunk over Tristan Thompson that really eliminated any doubt of his status for Game 4.

             The team will also look at Porter Jr. a second time next week for another workout in Chicago. Porter is this year's mystery man in the draft based on how he could go as high as two or even fall out of the top 10 due to his injury history. The Kings could also look to move down to take him, especially with how they won't pick in the first round next year.

This was the expected outcome after Colangelo and his wife were linked to several burner accounts criticizing players, coaches and front office executives.

While the 76ers search for a replacement, head coach Brett Brown will oversee basketball operations.

            Nuggets President of Basketball Operations Tim Connelly said he's willing to use the stretch provision this summer to clear up cap space.
        
        
             If the Nuggets give Nikola Jokic the max and Darrell Arthur and Wilson Chandler pick up their player options, Denver will be over $9M in the luxury tax. This doesn't even account for free agents Will Barton and Torrey Craig, so the Nuggets will have to get creative. Two obvious candidates for the stretch provision are Kenneth Faried and Arthur, and that basically means that the Nuggets could waive one of them and pay their salary over a period of three years as opposed to one.

             The Pelicans picked up his 2018-19 option right before the playoffs, so this will keep him under contract with the Pelicans through the 2020-21 season. According to Adrian Wojnarowski of ESPN, Gentry will receive a raise on his 2018-19 salary, a guaranteed contract for 2019-20 and a 2020-21 contract that will be performance-based. Gentry will look to build off an impressive campaign in which he led the Pelicans to a 6th place finish in the West with a 48-34 record.

             The Warriors won anyway, taking a 3-0 lead in the Finals behind a strong game from Draymond Green and an MVP-caliber performance from Kevin Durant. Curry made nine 3-pointers in Game 2 of this series, the most in NBA Finals history, and Cleveland intentionally blanketed him defensively. Ty Lue and his coaching staff haven't found any winning solutions to the problems posed by Golden State, though, so it wouldn't be surprising to see the gameplan shift for Game 4.

             Hood wasn't in the rotation for Games 1 and 2 but coach Ty Lue opted to use him ahead of struggling Jordan Clarkson (DNP-CD) tonight. He rewarded his coach's faith and gave Cleveland's second unit a big lift, while simultaneously thrilling DFS owners who plugged him into lineups as a cheap punt play. The defense left plenty to be desired but Cleveland needs his scoring and he should see 24+ minutes again on Friday.

             LBJ threw himself an impressive alley-oop in the first quarter which you can watch via the link below, and an ankle tweak prior to halftime didn't appear to hamper him. He wasn't as dominant as usual down the stretch of a must-win game, but there's no reason to think he'll be limited for a must-win home game on Friday. What he needs is added production from his teammates -- Rodney Hood and J.R. Smith reached double-digits, but Kevin Love scored most of his 20 points in the first half and the rest of the roster was vacant offensively.

             Iguodala missed six games with a left leg injury and wasn't moving with his normal fluidity prior to leaving the game with a right leg injury in the second quarter. He returned to finish the Warriors' 110-102 victory but as a simple precaution we'll list him as questionable for Game 4 on Friday. Given that the Warriors have a 3-0 lead in the series, they're unlikely to alter the starting lineup regardless of Iguodala's availability.

             Durant torched every single-coverage matchup he saw and the Cavs simply didn't have an answer for him. He finished 15-of-23 from the field and 7-of-7 from the line, with a 6-of-9 mark from downtown. Steph Curry and Klay Thompson scored a combined 21 points on 7-of-27 shooting, and nobody else had more than 11 points for Golden State, which made Durant's epic performance even more critical. The Warriors now hold a 3-0 series lead with a potential closeout game looming on Friday.

It helps that he thrived in five starts with averages of 9.2 points on 59.3% shooting (47.1% from deep), 4.8 rebounds, 1.2 assists and 1.0 blocks, but he'd need an ideal situation to be drafted in deep fantasy leagues next season.

             Udoka met with team owner Tom Gores, which follows Gores' recent meetings with candidates Dwane Casey and Kenny Smith. The team's front office was reportedly ""very impressed"" with Casey and he's the apparent frontrunner for the position, having just led Toronto to a Conference-leading 59-win season.

             It sounds like Smith has a shot to take over in Detroit, but it's still believed that Dwane Casey is the favorite, according to Stein and other reports. Stein also added that John Beilein has withdrawn from the coaching search in Detroit. Smith would be an unconventional hire for the Pistons, but they've already shown their desperation since February.

Smith is still a bit raw on the offensive end, but his raw athleticism and ability to always find the right spots on defense is what makes him such an alluring prospect.

Interestingly, Brian Colangelo was in attendance at Wednesday's workout, so maybe the 76ers front office has decided to stick with him despite Burner-gate.

             A full Achilles tear is nothing to shrug at, so it would be wise for the Pelicans front office to sign Cousins to a short-term, show-me type deal rather than awarding him a five-year, supermax contract this summer. The Mavericks have been reported to have interest in Cousins, but what they do on draft day could change how they view Cousins when free agency opens up on July 1. For what it's worth, Anthony Davis would like New Orleans to retain Boogie.

            The Spurs have zero interest in trading away Kawhi Leonard, according to Adrian Wojnarowski of ESPN.
        
        
             The Spurs maintain that there is no divide between Leonard and the front office, and Danny Green has echoed that sentiment during recent interviews. The 2017-18 season was a strange one for Leonard, who only managed to appear in a total of nine games due to an issue with his quad, but it seems unlikely that he'll be changing uniforms this summer.

             Simons is one of the youngest players in the 2018 draft, and while he is a bit underdeveloped from a physical standpoint, he's loaded with upside, has a nice shooting stroke and is ridiculously athletic. The Jazz have the No. 21 pick in the upcoming draft, which would be a bit high for Simmons, but if they like what they see on Thursday they may consider moving down to nab him.

             The 76ers recently retained the lawfirm of Paul/Weiss to investigate Burner-gate, and the findings of that probe could necessitate Colangelo's firing. The investigators interviewed both Colangelo and his wife, Barbara, for several hours over the course of two days and the reporting right now suggests Barbara may have been the one who was doing the tweeting. Colangelo maintains he had no knowledge of the burner accounts, but management is ""struggling"" to separate BC from his wife.

He's a solid defender, capable of creating his own shot and is fine playing off the ball, although if the Nuggets want him, they might consider trading down as No. 14 overall would be a slight reach for the third Holiday brother.

There have been rumors that the Kings were looking to pass on Doncic, but perhaps he put the odds in his favor of going No. 2 overall in the 2018 draft after Tuesday's solid outing. Either way, he's a lock to go within the top-5 on draft day and he has the skills to be fantasy-relevant during his rookie season.

             Iguodala, who has been sidelined since Game 3 of the Western Conference Finals, has been making solid progress of late. On Monday, Kerr said that Iggy had been ""pain-free"" over the past few days. The Warriors already have a healthy 2-0 lead on the Cavs, and the addition of Iguodala, a former Finals MVP, to their lineup would give them another stout defender to throw at LeBron James. He's set to go through a full practice on Tuesday, so things are trending in a positive direction.

I don’t imagine it playing out that way.""

            Wendell Carter has an individual workout scheduled with the Knicks.
        
        
             Carter averaged 13.5 points, 9.1 rebounds and 2.1 blocks in 26.8 minutes for Duke last season. He is commonly projected to land somewhere between six and ten in the upcoming draft, so the Knicks, who will draft ninth, are certainly a possibility. The issue for New York is attempting to predict how Carter would fit in alongside Kristaps Porzingis, as KP will likely shift to center full-time in the near future.

""He’s a little bit bigger than he looked on the court — a little bit bigger — but he’s an intriguing talent,"" said Mills. ""You look at what [Young] did with the players he had around him and what he was doing at the start of the season, you have to say this guy has the chance to be a special player."" Young will likely be off the board when the Knicks are on the clock at No. 9, but if he falls, he will very much be in consideration.

             Both coaches have already met with the franchise, so it looks like the final decision will come down to these two, with Casey being the favorite to land the gig. The Pistons have a lot of money owed ($113.6 million) to a not so great roster next season, so it could be tough for the new coach to break the playoff drought.

He's loaded with athleticism, is capable of creating his own shot off and has a nice shooting stroke, but it's unlikely he'll be able to contribute much to the fantasy hoops world during his rookie season.

Bridges put in averages of 17.7 points, 5.3 boards, 1.9 dimes, 2.6 treys, 1.5 steals and 1.1 blocks per game in his final season with Villanova, so New York would be a good potential landing spot for him in terms of fantasy hoops.

             Smith will be right in the Clippers' range when they come on the board with the No. 12 and 13 picks in the 2018 draft, and as a defensive-minded player, he said he'd like to learn under the tutelage of Patrick Beverley. Smith is one of the most athletic guys in the upcoming draft, but he does still need to work on his ballhandling and perimeter shooting.

We switched onto guards, wings, and bigs and I guarded all of them and did pretty well today."" Bates-Diop is an intriguing prospect with his wingspan and pure athleticism, so if he was able to impress Denver management during his workout, they might consider trading up in the second-round to nab him.

            Shane Larkin will likely procure a multiyear offer from another team this offseason according to Gary Washburn of the Boston Globe.
        
        
             Larkin was the third point guard on the depth chart in Boston, but the unrestricted free agent should be able to land a job as the primary backup elsewhere. Larkin's second stint in the NBA went a lot smoother and he's expected to get a significant raise. With the Celtics hoping to bring back Marcus Smart, Larkin's time in Boston is likely over.

             He wasn't able to finish the workout, but the injury is believed to be minor. The younger brother of the Greek Freak, Kostas Antetokounmpo is a raw prospect that didn't get a lot of burn at Dayton, averaging 5.2 points, 2.9 rebounds and 1.1 blocks in 15.1 minutes per game. He did improve his stock at the combine and measured well with a height of 6'10.5 and wingspan of 7'2.25. He's projected to be a late second round pick and will have to earn a living on the defensive end early on.

             ""I don't think we'll look to trade out of the draft,"" Nelson said. ""We're excited about the young nucleus with Dennis Smith, and obviously Harrison Barnes kind of grabbing the torch and providing the leadership role that Dirk has provided over the years. We're excited about getting another young, impact guy we can add to the mix."" Nelson did add that there are a number of guys the Mavericks like ""well past five,"" so maybe they look to add another pick or even trade down.

             NBA officials are ""still working on what mechanism coaches will use to trigger a challenge and what the parameters are,"" but they won't use a challenge flag like the NFL. Even if the experiment goes well, the NBA is unlikely to implement a change until at least 2019-20.

             Steph went full on Steph in Game 2 pulling up from all over behind the arch, making circus shots as the shot clock expired. Not only were his nine 3-pointers a Finals record, but also a career playoff-high for Curry. We saw him and Kendrick Perkins get into at the end of the third quarter, but Curry said it was ""much ado about nothing."" He's now averaging 31 points, 6.5 rebounds and 8.5 assists per game for the series, possibly making a strong case for a Finals MVP, one of the few accolades he's missing, were the Warriors to go on and win the title.

If he continues this pace into Game 3, this series could be over sooner rather than later.

Having the home crowd in Cleveland showing him some love on Wednesday may get him back on track.

            JaVale McGee will start in Game 2 against the Cavaliers on Sunday.
        
        
             He started the second half of Game 1 and logged six minutes, scored four points, grabbed a board and got a block. This is McGee's first start since May 4th in the second round against the Pelicans. With Kevon Looney not playing lights out, he could be in the starting lineup until Andre Iguodala (leg) returns. McGee will start alongside Steph Curry, Kevin Durant, Draymond Green and Klay Thompson.

             He was listed as questionable but was optimistic about being able to play. Thompson did play 45 minutes in Game 1 on Thursday and received around-the-clock treatment since then, so it's not too much of a surprise that he's available to play. The Warriors must be confident enough in his health that he's not in danger of injuring it further by playing, but we'll have to see if there's any sort of minutes restriction for him or if he'll have the full green light. Regardless, this is huge news for Golden State.

             Iguodala hasn't played since Game 3 of the Western Conference Finals, but head coach Steve Kerr did say he was ""optimistic"" that Iguodala will be able to get back ""at some point"" during the Finals. Klay Thompson (ankle) will go through his pregame routine before the Dubs make the final call on him, but if he's forced to join Iggy on the sidelines, that could translate to big minutes for guys like Shaun Livingston, Nick Young and Quinn Cook.

             Both of these guys could be options for Chicago when they come on the board with the No. 7 overall selection on draft day, so this will be an important workout for the pair as they try and separate themselves in the eyes of Bulls management. Carter has good size for the center position, is a skilled passer and solid defender, but he's not the most explosive athlete in the lottery. Bridges is an impressive athlete who has a knack for getting to the rim, but he could be better on defense.

""I can’t ease my way into the game and let the game come to me. As soon as I check into the game, I have to go after it."" Hood didn't log a single minute during the Cavs Game 1 loss, and while Lue maintains that Hood hasn't been ""X'd out"" of the rotation, it's clear that he won't be a major factor during the Finals.

             This was his first workout with a team before the draft.

The Hornets averaged 27 3-point attempts per game last season, 10th fewest in the league. Bridges could add to that as he was a 43 percent 3-point shooter in his final season with Villanova.

If Klay does go, McCaw may only see around four minutes like he did in Game 1.

            Timofey Mozgov will play for the Russian national team in the last two games of FIBA Basketball World Cup European Qualifiers.
        
        
             The Russian team said Mozzy has been working out and continues to be in good shape. Mozgov did not play more than 10 minutes in any game during the 2018 portion of the season, so a double-digit minute workload would be a taller order.

             To be very clear, it doesn't sound like he's limited and he added his eye ""feels a lot better."" James lit it up with his eye issue en route to his postseason career-high 51 points, and he was asked about scoring 51 with a bloodshot eye on Saturday. ""Nah, I had some points before that,"" he said. James is going to need another historic performance, but Klay Thompson (ankle) being limited could help Cleveland's chances.

             A lot going on here at the Warriors practice. First, Klay said on Saturday that he's ""optimistic"" he can play in Game 2, and Stephen Curry said he'd bet Klay goes, as well. On the other hand, Thompson is receiving around-the-clock treatment, he had a noticeable limp at practice on Saturday, he is dealing with stiffness, and he still has ""significant swelling,"" according to Yahoo! Sports. Things do seem to be trending in the wrong direction, but Klay is a tough one and is likely going to at least give it a try. If he can't go, we'll see a lot of Pat McCaw, Shaun Livingston and Nick Young to help out. Expect Klay to be a game-time decision.

             Ivey is from Queens, NY and was interviewed for the job late last month. He had a 10-year NBA career as a guard, but he didn't get much run from 2009-14. Ivey is also good friends with Kevin Durant and is well-liked around the league, so the Knicks continue to make strong hires to help their perception around the NBA's finest.

             ""I took risky looks,"" Durant added. He's not wrong and in particular he was not very good when the shot clock had 15 seconds or less on it, making just 4-of-15 attempts from the field with no treys. Durant also faced tight defense on 10 of his 16 shots from beyond 10 feet. He's one of the better tightly-contested scorers ever, but KD sounds like he'll be looking to improve the quality of his shots in Game 2.

The Warriors and Thompson have said all along that Thompson is going to play, and Stephen Curry said on Saturday that he'd bet Klay is a go. Thompson didn't look hindered in Game 1, but apparently his ailment did swell up on him. For now, pencil him in for 40 minutes at home.

             The coach added that Iggy is improving, which the team has been saying for almost a week now. The fact that Iguodala didn't play in a crucial Game 7 vs. Houston indicates that he would likely need to miss the two home games. For now, it seems like Game 3 on Wednesday is a reasonable target. Until then, look for a possible switch with JaVale McGee as a starter with more Kevon Looney, Shaun Livingston, Jordan Bell and Nick Young helping out.

             Ball worked out for the Lakers and Warriors this week, but the near-universal consensus around the league is that LiAngelo is not an NBA-caliber player. In addition, the Lakers have already dealt with enough of the circus surrounding LaVar Ball, that they would be understandably hesitant to add LiAngelo even if he was talented enough to contribute.

             This report serves mostly as confirmation, as it was assumed Young would hold a private workout with Orlando sooner rather than later. The Magic will select sixth in the 2018 NBA draft, and are in desperate need of a point guard. While there is plenty of debate about how well Young will fare in the NBA, he is the best PG available in this year's draft class.

Frank is back in New York, but went to work on his body in his native France after the season ended. ""I’ve added some weight and muscle,"" Ntilikina said. ""I spent a lot of time working on my body in France. I’m getting better and more comfortable with my skills and body."" Whether Frank plays primarily at PG or SG next season may depend on whether the Knicks select a point guard with their lottery pick.

             He has been fined $25,000 and his Flagrant 2 has been downgraded to a Flagrant 1. The NBA took a very long time to come to a ruling on this one, so they apparently explored all the angles from the incident in Game 1. Considering Thompson’s hand made contact with Draymond Green’s face and the ball hit Green, the NBA certainly could’ve had some in the league thinking that he should be ruled out. With him in the lineup, he’ll likely be looking at around 20 minutes like he did in Game 1.

            Mo Bamba said his shooting improvement is ""night and day"" from his last game at Texas.
        
        
             He shot a respectable 68.1 percent from the line last year, but he did only make 32.2 percent on two-point jumpers and made just 27.5 percent on treys. Bamba is a near lock to go in the top 10 and he has a chance to go in the top five. The Bulls had a workout for him today and they could certainly take him at No. 7.

            Rodney Hood ""going to get a chance and an opportunity"" in this series, according to coach Ty Lye.
        
        
             Jordan Clarkson has been historically bad based on some advanced measurements, so presumably Hood would take over there. Hood and the coaching staff have been on the outs since Hood declined to enter a game in garbage time. Since that game back on May 21, he's only logged three minutes with all of those coming in garbage time. Maybe he can be a DFS punt play.

Embiid isn't exactly going all out, but his injury history is no secret. We'll see if this news affects how he approaches the offseason.

             According to the Orlando Sentinel, the team is ""hoping to develop him slowly but steadily over the next few years."" In his rookie year, Isaac showed plenty of upside on the defensive end, especially when he was in space. His ankle issue was really the biggest headline, and staying healthy will probably be the biggest goal in his sophomore season. He'll be a target in the later rounds of fantasy drafts.

             The good news is he did a few things at practice today, but the team mentioned ""inflammation of the nerve surrounding the left knee"" was a big issue for the former Finals MVP before Game 1. While Iguodala is optimistic he will make it back in this series, it sounds like he may have to wait until the Warriors get to Cleveland. JaVale McGee gave the Warriors great energy in the third on Thursday, so he may actually start over Kevon Looney. Shaun Livingston should also be a factor.

             The Pistons are doing a complete overhaul after their first year in their new arena was a major flop. Bower received a contract extension back in 2016, but he and the team won't see the rest of it through. The Pistons are still looking for a coach and they're missing several pieces in their front office, as well.

             This will go down as one of the worst mental lapses ever, but Lue added the Smith getting the rebound was big, and that rebound prevented the Warriors from getting an opportunity to take the lead in regulation. LeBron James also didn't throw Smith under the bus, but the Warriors -- especially Draymond Green -- had a little fun at Smith's expense. Smith has been brutal on the road, but it sounds like he'll have an opportunity to redeem himself. If he struggles early, maybe we see more Kyle Korver.

             According to ESPN's Chris Hayes, Thompson might face a suspension after shoving the ball in the face of Draymond Green and ""Kevin Love, who was not in the game at the time, could be hit with a one-game suspension for stepping onto the court while an altercation was ongoing."" It would be surprising if the NBA decided to punish two of Cleveland's starters, but if the league chooses to stick to the letter of the law, there is justification. The NBA will likely announce their decision shortly.

            The Warriors clarified after Game 1 that Klay Thompson's injury isn't near his knee. The leg contusion is down closer to his ankle.
        
        
             Thompson was forced to limp to the locker room after J.R. Smith slipped and rolled into his leg early in the first quarter. Fourtantley, Klay was able to return to the contest and finished with 24 points, three rebounds and one assist in 45 minutes. He is expected to be ready to handle his typical allotment of minutes in Game 2 on Sunday.

            The Pistons are not interested in Jerry Stackhouse as a potential head coaching candidate, according to the Detroit Free Press.
        
        
             When the Pistons fired Stan Van Gundy, it was assumed that Stackhouse would be one of the favorites to replace him. Stackhouse is widely viewed as a coaching star on the rise, and he was a two-time All-Star as a member of the Pistons during his playing days. However, this report indicates that he apparently ""does rub some people the wrong way.""

             LeBron's eye was clearly bloodshot in the second half. ""Draymond poked me right square in the eye. I'll deal with that over the next couple of days,"" said James after the game. LeBron added that his vision was ""pretty much blurry, and it got worse and worse as the game went on."" King James still finished with 51 points, eight rebounds and eight assists. We should expect an update on his vision Friday afternoon.

             It was a classic Draymond stat line, coming one assist short of a triple-double and two blocks short of a 5x5. Green kept up his strong presence on the glass of late, he's now averaging 13.1 boards a game over his last six. He got into it with Tristan Thompson as the game ended, taunting the Cavs and egging on the crowd after Thompson was ejected. Green had already been assessed a tech earlier in the game for arguing a call, so he could have been in serious trouble had he been given another.

Until Iguodala is cleared to play, expect Looney to stay in the rotation.

             OK, maybe we're being nice on saying it was a clock-management mistake with Smith dribbling the ball out in a tie game and the clock winding down to end regulation. Smith explained himself after the game. ""I was trying to get enough to bring it out to get a shot off,"" Smith said. ""I knew we were tied, I thought we were going to call timeout. If I thought we were ahead, I'd have held onto the ball and let them foul me."" However, coach Ty Lue said that J.R. told him that he thought they were up, so it's tough to buy what Smith is saying.

             He had not played since Game 3 of the WCF, where he only played three minutes and was the only time he saw the floor during the series. McGee was playing well until he faced a wide-open dunk and was rejected by the rim, but coach Steve Kerr said he gave him ""a burst of energy"" to start the third. Considering how the Warriors aren't getting much out of Kevon Looney, McGee could stick in the starting lineup until Andre Iguodala (leg) is back.

They also report that his wife, Barbara Bettini, ""may have been involved"" in posting tweets from burner accounts.

Nance only logged 19 minutes but was efficient shooting 4-of-6 from the floor with no turnovers. The Cavs were leaning on some bigger lineups as the game went along. At one point LeBron James, Jeff Green, J.R. Smith, Kevin Love and Nance were all on the floor. This lineup was on the floor together for less than a minute during the regular and postseason combined. Considering Nance had the best plus/minus among Cavs bigs tonight, he could see more run on Sunday.

            Jeff Green scored seven points making just 1-of-6 3-pointers with three rebounds, five assists and one steal in Game 1 against Golden State on Thursday.
        
        
             He played 36 minutes, his second most while coming off the bench all season. Green missed a lot of shots that could've changed the game and fell well short of his 19-point performance in Game 7 against Boston. The Cavs were so close to pulling off a win and could've used more from Green. He'll likely continue to come off the bench as Kevin Love stays healthy.

             He shoved the ball into Draymond Green's face as late game frustrations boiled over. It's unlikely Thompson will face suspension, but it is certainly a possibility. We'll know more tomorrow after the league makes an official decision. He only logged 20 minutes, his fewest since Game 1 of the ECF.

             J.R. Smith was diving for a ball and undercut Thompson near the knee. This injury could've been worse initially, but it sounds like he is going to be OK. Thompson appeared to be in a lot of pain on the floor and had a noticeable limp heading to the bench and locker room. This is the same knee he hurt against the Rockets, but it sounds like he could be back soon.

             He cleared the concussion protocol earlier today and coach Ty Lue said all along that Love would start once he's available. While Love hasn't played well against the Warriors, this is a huge addition to the undermanned Cavs, who already face an uphill battle as big underdogs coming into this series.

             He returned from a back injury last series in Game 6, but only logged a total of five minutes over Game 6 and Game 7. In the last series, Kerr did say he was considering he would play Jordan Bell more, and that turned out to be true. In other words, there's good chance McCaw is out there as a main wing with three centers in a 9-10 man rotation.

If Thompson is put out in space against smaller lineups, Lue could go with guys like Larry Nance or slide Kevin Love over to the five in smaller lineups. Thompson may have a tougher time hitting 28.0 minutes per game like he did against the Celtics.

There were some reports floating around that the Celtics could try to move up to the top 10 to get him, but it would require some serious draft capital. They do hold the Kings pick for next year, but that pick may turn out to be an excellent selection.

Maybe Porzingis can start doing on-court work at training camp, but the Knicks haven't updated his progress too often in the offseason.

             This was reported by ESPN two days ago, and of course there is bigger in 76ers world these days. It is worth a mention that the official release does say President of Basketball Operations Bryan Colangelo made the official announcement, so maybe that's why it took a couple days. Brown may have had one of his worst stretches as a coach when the 76ers fell to the Celtics, but his body of work since the Sam Hinkie days makes this an easy call for the 76ers. His normal-sized blue-collar style fits in with the city and the team's identity, as well. We'd assume there isn't a press conference here.

             Even after going with point guard Frank Ntilikina last year, the Knicks would likely consider Young with their No. 9 pick. However, there's a very good chance he won't make it that far down with so many top-eight teams needing a guard. Young would be one of the smallest players in the NBA at 178 pounds and a standing reach under eight feet, but leading the NCAA in scoring and assists should still make him a high pick.

             That is big news after his injury on May 25 when he collided with Jayson Tatum. Coach Ty Lue said that Love is going to be in the starting lineup, which raises some questions on who starts next to him. Tristan Thompson had the worst net rating against the Warriors among current Cavs players this season, so maybe the team goes back to a small-ball lineup.

            Ron Baker exercised his $4.5 million player option for the 2018-19 season.
        
        
             It was a no-brainer for Baker because he wasn't going to get anything close to this on the open market. Baker is still recovering from arthroscopic shoulder stabilization surgery that he had back in February, but he's expected to be ready for training camp.

             ""He took it the hardest [the loss to Golden State], I thought, because he knew if he hadn't had the unfortunate injury, he's dragging us the last [way to the Finals],"" Morey added. Paul has already begun to recruit LeBron James, and you have to wonder if CP3 will consider playing on a discount so the Rockets can re-sign Clint Capela as well. Now 33, Paul probably still has a few elite years left.

             The Manimal has been on the block for a couple years and the Nuggets don't have a need for him with Paul Millsap and Trey Lyles ahead of him on the depth chart. Faried is owed $13.7 million in 2018-19, so Woj believes that the Nuggets may package him with the No. 14 pick to get him off their books -- they need cap space to bring back Will Barton.

The surgery won't impact his appeal as an unrestricted free agent this summer -- he proved his value for the short-handed Celtics this year and should have plenty of interested teams.

             The Celtics' medical update also stated that Hayward is expected to be at ""full strength for the start of training camp.""

             Capela is expected to command a high annual salary but Houston can match any offer for their restricted free agent. The list of unrestricted free agents includes CP3, Trevor Ariza, Luc Mbah a Moute, Gerald Green, Joe Johnson and Tarik Black. Morey acknowledged the lofty price-tag for keeping the team intact, saying, ""We have an expensive team. [Owner Tilman Fertitta] has for sure signed off for that."" He's hoping that the team's success will entice free agents to Houston, as they won 65 regular-season games and fell one win short of the NBA Finals.

He admitted that his progress has been ""slower than expected,"" but said he doesn't have ""too much doubt"" that he'll be cleared to play before the Finals conclude. If necessary, Game 7 would be played June 17 at Oracle Arena, potentially giving him more than two weeks to convalesce. Until he returns, we should continue to see Kevon Looney starting with more minutes available for Shaun Livingston and Nick Young.

            If Kevin Love (concussion) can play, he will not come off the bench in his return to action.
        
        
             Coach Ty Lue is still unsure if Love is going to be able to return for Game 1 on Thursday. He's still going through the protocol and there's no word of him being symptom free yet. Considering Love had multiple concussions in his career with one as recently as March, there's a very good chance he won't be able to recover for Game 1 from the injury sustained on May 25. If he's out, Tristan Thompson may have to start again along with Jeff Green.

             ""I'm going to play aggressively, confidently to help my team win,"" Curry said. ""Whether that means I'm Finals MVP, who cares?"" The Warriors are widely-considered as Steph's team, but it was Andre Iguodala and Kevin Durant deservedly winning the MVPs during the two title runs. Curry is now running hot and he should be considered as one of the favorites to win the award this time around.

Tucker turned out to be a wonderful pickup for the Rockets this year and he has three more years left on his deal. He has more value in reality than in fantasy.

             According to the team, he is making progress, but ""the pain that accompanies the bone bruise persists, as done the inflammation of the nerve surrounding the left knee."" That's not exactly an encouraging description of his injury, and he had trouble with forward and lateral movement over the weekend. Iguodala will be re-evaluated again before Game 2, but he could certainly be out for that one. With no Hamptons Five lineup, Kevon Looney likely starts with more Shaun Livingston, Nick Young and Jordan Bell.

He was an assistant coach with the Magic under Stan Van Gundy from 2007-2012, so he has some history being in Orlando, and it'll be interesting to see if he's able to turn things around for a franchise coming off its sixth consecutive losing season. Something we'll be watching closely over training camp and the preseason will be Mario Hezonja and Jonathan Isaac fit into Clifford's rotations.

            Andrew Wiggins will not play for the Canadian national team in June's FIBA World Cup qualifying events.
        
        
             According to NBA reporter Josh Lewenberg, ""one factor in Wiggins’ decision to decline Canada Basketball’s most recent invitation is his strained relationship with head coach Jay Triano, stemming from his previous and only experience playing with the senior men’s team in 2015."" Earlier this month, Adrian Wojnarowski of ESPN hinted that the Wolves might consider trading Wiggings this summer.

             Johnson averaged a career-low 6.8 points and 1.5 assists in 21.9 minutes per game in 2017-18, but should still be able to contribute in limited minutes off the bench next season. ""Hell yeah, I want to keep rolling,"" Johnson said after Monday's Game 7 loss. ""I'm not even thinking about [retiring]. I would love to have a chance to win a ring. I want to go to a contender. I don't want to just be out here playing just to be playing.""

            According to a report in the New York Post, the Hawks and Suns have interest in free agent Michael Beasley.
        
        
             The report also claims that there the Knicks are interested in bringing back Beasley for another season. Beasley played well for the Knicks last season, averaging 13.2 points (on 50.6 percent shooting) and 5.6 rebounds in 22.3 minutes per game. However, there is limited money available on the open market, so it would be surprising if Beasley (who is still a liability on defense) was able to secure a contract north of $8 million, as the Post report suggests.

             Iguodala bumped knees with James Harden in Game 3 and missed the final four games of the Western Conference Finals. His status for his status for Game 1 on Thursday is unknown. Speaking with the TNT crew after Game 7, coach Steve Kerr said: ""It’s literally a day-to-day thing. But he has not progressed, unfortunately, as well as we thought he would."" Iggy's status will be updated throughout the week.

             Capela was 9-of-10 from the field, but he was hacked a few times and wasn't able to punish the Warriors at the free throw line (2-of-6 FTs). Capela is a rising star for the Rockets and will become a restricted free agent this summer, so don't be surprised if some max offers are in his future. We'd expect the Rockets to retain him, though it will be extremely difficult if they are somehow able to sign LeBron James and bring back Chris Paul. He'll be a beast in real life and in fantasy wherever he lands.

            James Harden's 32 points weren't enough as the Rockets fell to the Warriors in Game 7, adding six rebounds, six assists, four steals, one block and two triples on 12-of-29 shooting.
        
        
             The Rockets were in cruise control heading into halftime, but couldn't buy a basket in the third quarter -- they even missed 27 straight triples at one point, the most consecutive 3s missed in NBA history. Harden struggled shooting the ball all series, missing 59 total 3-pointers -- that's 11 more than any other player has ever missed in a single playoff series. If they have a strong offseason, Houston should get another shot at taking down the Warriors in 2018-19 -- Chris Paul and Clint Capela are free agents and the Rockets are expected to make a push to lure LeBron James to Houston.

KD wasn't even at his best tonight until he turned it on in the second half, so maybe that's a sign of things to come against LeBron James and the Cavaliers in the NBA Finals. Klay Thompson was in foul trouble most of the night but still put up 19 points with three boards, one assist, two steals and three triples, while Draymond Green added 10 points, 13 rebounds, five assists, one steal and one block.

             He finished one rebound shy of a triple-double, becoming the seventh player since 1984 to do that in Game 7. The Warriors looked shaky in the first half, but Curry ignited them in the third quarter, scoring 14 of his 27 points. Curry did make a trip to the locker room after taking a shot to the head in the first quarter, but he's obviously fine and there doesn't appear to be anything to worry about. The Warriors will now face the Cavaliers in the NBA Finals for the fourth time in a row and will be looking for their third championship in four years.

             Ball put in averages of 12.6 points, 2.4 triples and 2.9 rebounds per game on 42.5% shooting in his overseas stint with Vytautas Prienu of Lithuania. At the moment, it seems unlikely that he'll be able to land on an NBA roster via the draft, so he'll need to really impress while he goes on his workout tour.

            Andre Iguodala (leg) has been ruled out for Game 7 according to coach Steve Kerr.
        
        
             He was originally considered doubtful and is still experiencing pain when he runs. Kerr said the minutes for his main guys will be the same again (40s), but added that no one will play the full 48. For now, the expectation is that Kevon Looney will draw his fourth straight start.

             This explains why he wasn't at Game 7. This is similar to the operation that Andre Drummond had before the season and it's one of the reasons why the big man had a bounce-back year. As for his recovery from knee surgery, Irving has been walking without crutches for over a month, but it's not clear when he will get the green light for full basketball activities.

             The Heat have already stated that they expect Johnson to be ""fine for camp,"" so this isn't anything we'll need to be concerned about next year. Johnson took a step back this season after his career 2016-17 campaign, but posted respectable averages of 10.8 points, 4.9 rebounds, 3.8 assists, 0.7 blocks, 1.0 steals and 0.8 triples. With Hassan Whiteside on the block, Johnson's value could get a bump in 2018-19.

             This quote is bad timing after his brutal performance in Sunday's Game 7 defeat, but to be fair, he was playing at less than 100 percent. ""My thumb is killing me,"" he said. ""My whole right hand hurts."" The Celtics tried to negotiate a contract extension last year, but the sides were too far apart. The Celtics can match any offer that Smart receives, but only if the price doesn't get out of hand. One option for the Celtics is to give Smart the qualifying offer of $6.1 million and keep him in Boston for 2018-19, but he would become an unrestricted free agent during the summer of 2019 in that scenario.

             The Celtics finished with a mere five turnovers but squandered that efficiency by shooting 34.1% as a team, including 7-of-39 from downtown. Since 1983 no NBA team has won a game (regular season or playoffs) while shooting 17.9% or worse on at least 39 attempts from deep. Jaylen Brown shot 5-of-18 from the field, Marcus Morris was 5-of-14, and Terry Rozier was 2-of-14, as brutal offense condemned Boston to a Game 7 loss on their home court. Each summer brings new reports about Smart's improved shooting form and range, yet he's never been above 36.7% shooting in four NBA seasons.

             The Cavs were playing without Kevin Love (concussion) and the veteran Green got the nod as a fill-in starter. He burned his former team in 41 minutes of action, giving LeBron James some much-needed assistance offensively -- the only other Cavs in double-figures were Tristan Thompson (10 points) and J.R. Smith (11 points). Green's viability as a DFS option in the Finals will hinge largely on the health of Kevin Love, who is day-to-day with a concussion.

             Nance had a rough stint in the first half and couldn't get out of his own way, committing four fouls during his limited time on the court. Cleveland controlled the second half to earn an 87-79 victory, due largely to their defense and Boston's poor shooting, and they'll get three days of rest before Game 1 on the Finals on Thursday. If Kevin Love (concussion) isn't ready to play by then, the Cavs will need Nance to play much better than he did tonight.

             Tatum made 9-of-17 field goals and 4-of-4 free throws, with two 3-pointers, but it wasn't enough to divert LeBron James' well-worn path to the Finals. The Celts' young star may finish third in Rookie of the Year voting behind Ben Simmons and Donovan Mitchell, but that doesn't diminish his accomplishments whatsoever -- Boston's braintrust looks smarter than ever after trading down to snag him at No. 3 last summer. His offensive role will change if Kyrie Irving and Gordon Hayward are both healthy next season, but he'll still be gone in the middle rounds of re-draft fantasy leagues.

            Terry Rozier struggled during Boston's Game 7 loss on Sunday, shooting 2-of-14 from the field for four points, four rebounds, four assists and one steal in 36 minutes.
        
        
             Neither team could get their perimeter shots to fall, and Boston finished 7-of-39 from deep -- Rozier himself was 0-of-10. He filled in admirably without Kyrie Irving (knee surgery) in the playoffs, but shot a combined 37-of-98 from the field (37.8%) during the Eastern Conference finals. With tonight's game, he's just the third player since 1963 to attempt at least 10 three-pointers without a single make -- James Harden went 0-of-11 from deep in Game 5 vs. Golden State this week, and John Starks went 0-of-11 vs. Houston in 1994. Rozier shot 38.1% from deep this season, easily a career-high, but it's safe to assume he'll continue working on his range all summer.

            The Cavaliers advanced to the Finals with an 87-79 road win on Sunday, taking Game 7 behind LeBron James' 35 points, 15 rebounds, nine assists and two blocks.
        
        
             LeBron played every second of the game in yet another masterful performance, as coach Ty Lue was true to his word -- asked before the game if he planned for LBJ to play all 48 minutes, Lue replied, ""Not all 48, no ... but if I have to [play him] I will."" James committed eight turnovers but also made 12-of-24 FGs and 8-of-11 FTs, bullying his way to his eighth consecutive trip to the NBA Finals. He's won 24 straight Eastern Conference playoff series and this latest achievement was all the more impressive since Cleveland fell down 0-2 and lost Kevin Love (concussion) in Game 6. Rival teams in the East have yet to figure out how to stop LeBron, but he'll face a stiff test vs. either the Rockets or Warriors in the Finals, beginning May 31.

            Patrick McCaw (back) is unlikely to be in coach Steve Kerr's rotation for Game 7 on Monday.
        
        
             McCaw played four minutes during garbage time in Game 6 but Kerr doesn't anticipate using him in his typical rotation for a must-win elimination game. He said it's ""too early"" in McCaw's return from a serious injury to ask him to play critical minutes in a playoff game. There's still a chance we'll see more of him if Golden State advances to the Finals.

             ""He looks questionable,"" said D'Antoni when asked about Paul's status for Game 7. ""I'm sure the team doctors will check him out tomorrow. We might not know until afternoon. We'll play it by ear."" It sounds like CP3 could be headed for a game-time call, but the odds of him being able to get out there aren't great. If Paul is forced to watch Game 7 from the sidelines, Eric Gordon will stick with the starters and there will be more minutes for Gerald Green.

             This is the first we're hearing of a toe injury for Looney, but it would be surprising to see a sore toe hold him out of an elimination game. Steve Kerr already said he doesn't expect Iguodala to play tomorrow, so he sounds a bit closer to doubtful than questionable. Check back for another update following Monday morning's shootaround.

Larry Nance fell back into James' leg during Game 6, but LBJ played through it, and that's exactly what he'll do tonight with Cleveland's season on the line. He didn't sit out a single game during his age-32 season, and Game 7 will mark his 100th game of the year, tying the most games he's ever played in a single season.

             He started off slow but picked it up in the second half hitting four 3-pointers and scoring 16 points. This was a statement game for Curry and it’s no secret that the Warriors are at their best when Steph is running the offense. The Rockets certainly knew that as they held the Warriors to 93.0 points per game in the previous two as they kept the passes down, but Steph dominated during the second half as the Warriors crushed Houston 64-25 in the second half. Curry is averaging 30.2 points per game inside Oracle this series compared to just 18.6 in Houston, so we'll see if that trend continues in a critical Game 7 on Monday.

We worked too hard this season to go home,"" Klay said after tonight's win. This is the first time both Conference Finals have reached a Game 7 since 1979. Back then there was no 3-point line, but there will be plenty of those in Houston on Monday when Klay and the Dubs come to town.

            Patrick McCaw scored two points with two rebounds and one steal in four minutes in Game 6 against Houston on Saturday.
        
        
             He hadn't played since March 31st against Sacramento after a scary fall and wasn't even expected to play at all this postseason. McCaw even called his parents that he would be active, and the crowd was pumped up when he hit the court. While McCaw only got in for the last 4:28 once the game was out of reach, he played solid for those minutes. We could see him play more minutes in Game 7 on Monday as he gets readjusted to being in the lineup.

            Andre Iguodala (leg) said he considers himself questionable on Monday against the Rockets.
        
        
             There really hasn't been much optimism on Iguodala. Coach Steve Kerr said today that he wouldn't play him until he can run, and he's also having trouble moving laterally. The Warriors really couldn't find a fifth option until the second half, so maybe Kerr mixes it up. Expect to see Kevon Looney, Jordan Bell, Shaun Livingston, Nick Young and maybe even Pat McCaw see some run.

            James Harden scored 32 points with seven rebounds, nine assists, three steals, four 3-pointers and a postseason-high nine turnovers in a 115-86 Game 6 loss against the Warriors on Saturday.
        
        
             He did all he could to keep Houston in this game, but the Rockets had 21 turnovers as the biggest problem today. Harden now has five career playoff games with at least nine turnovers, giving him the most such games ever (LeBron James has three). On the plus side, Harden was able to snap out of a brutal 0-of-22 slump from deep with a couple treys in the first quarter. He'll need it to come together in Game 7 at Toyota Center on Monday.

             It's the most minutes he's played all postseason and the most points he's scored since Game 3 of the first round against Minnesota. If Chris Paul remains out, expect Green to again receive a heavier load of minutes in Game 7 on Monday, especially if guys like Luc Mbah a Moute come out flat.

             He came out shooting the lights out, scoring eight points in the first 4:30 of the game and going 4-of-4 from deep in the first half with 16 points. The second half was a different story as Gordon went 1-of-4 from both the field and the line. If Chris Paul is out for Game 7 on Monday, he'll have to put together a complete game for the Rockets to advance to the NBA Finals.

             He hasn't played since Game 3 and that may have been due to his shoulder issue, but with the Rockets shorthanded he returned to the rotation. Mbah a Moute continued to struggle, and he may not have played in the second half had the game been closer. Depending on Chris Paul's status and how coach Mike D'Antoni feels, he may or may not play in Game 7 on Monday.

             He didn't score until the 5:58 mark in the fourth quarter and the Rockets were -32 when he was on the floor. This was his lowest scoring game of the postseason and worst +/- of the entire season.

             He'll be out there with the other four All-Stars for the third time in a row as Andre Iguodala (leg) recovers). Looney likely won't have as much defensive pressure on him in this game because he won't have to get switched on to Chris Paul (hamstring), but the Rockets almost certainly will try to put him on James Harden when they can. Looney has scored four points in each of last three games with little else, so the bar isn't very high in DFS.

We should still see Kevon Looney in the starting lineup while Jordan Bell, Shaun Livingston and Quinn Cook help out on the bench.

            Taurean Prince said he'll focus on his handles and on-ball defense this summer.
        
        
             ""Turning defense into offense—that seems to be a key,"" Prince said. ""But most importantly, ball handling. If you tighten up your ball handling, everything else becomes easier."" New coach Lloyd Pierce also said that the Hawks haven't played their best ball yet, and it sounds like he's going to ask Prince to do even more. Needless to say, Prince will be a hot fantasy target after a really strong offensive finish last season.

             Really going out on a limb there, coach Lue. Kidding aside, there's been some talk about LeBron being tired before Friday, but all those concerns were put to bed after an epic performance. The over/under on LeBron's minutes tomorrow is probably 47.5 with Kevin Love now out. LeBron likely would've played all but 57 seconds last night, but the game got to garbage time to keep him out for the final 57 seconds.

Tatum did take some contact to his head from the Kevin Love collision and he didn't look like himself for about half the game, so the team will evaluate him again before Game 7 on Sunday. For now, expect him to get 36-40 minutes in Game 7.

He's been doing some on-court work with the team and was getting shots up during shootaround on Thursday. He probably won't be in the rotation tonight, but maybe that'll change. Regardless, this is a pleasant surprise today.

Love does have a history of concussions with his most recent one coming in March, so it's possible he would be out beyond a possible win on Sunday. It should be Jeff Green starting with more Larry Nance. Tristan Thompson may also have to play a little more in this game.

             He hasn't been ruled out yet, but it'll be really tough for him to be out there on Sunday. He first has to be deemed symptom-free, and then would have to do non-contact activity while remaining symptom-free in the process. Plus, he's had two concussions in the last three seasons. For now, expect to see Jeff Green start on Sunday with more Larry Nance, who closed out nicely in the fourth on Friday.

             McDonough generated some headlines last week when he told reporters the Suns would be open to moving the No. 1 overall pick. However, he put those comments in context on Friday. ""There’s a very small grouping of players we’d consider trading it for,"" McDonough said. ""It would have to be a proven young star player with multiple years on his contract or multiple years of team control. Once you start whittling down the list, that list probably shrinks to a handful of players, if not fewer players than that, so I think the overwhelming likelihood is that we keep the pick.""

             The early assumption was that Deandre Ayton and Luka Doncic would be the first two players off the board. However, ESPN reported earlier in the week that Kings were not high on Doncic and would lean towards passing on him if Ayton went first. This Sac Bee report states that Doncic will certainly be an option, but the Kings will also consider Missouri forward Michael Porter Jr., Michigan State forward Jaren Jackson Jr., Texas center Mohamed Bamba and Duke forward Marvin Bagley III.

""Sh*t, he wasn’t like that when I brought him over there. When he first came [to the Lakers], he never got hurt. He was never hurt."" Cleary, Ball believes he is more knowledgeable on training athletes than the Lakers' head trainer. L.A. will do their best to ignore this nonsense.

             The top point guard available is Trae Young of Oklahoma, with Collin Sexton of Alabama widely considered the second-best PG prospect. Although Frank Ntilikina played off the ball frequently over the second half of last season, it appears the Knicks front office views him as a full-time point guard going forward. They will have a very interesting decision to make if Young slides all the way to No. 9.

             The Raptors went to the Texas assistant well the last time, but it was with Dwane Casey and the Mavs. Messina and Udoka are two of the top three assistant coaches with Messina taking the head job while Gregg Popovich was away from the team in April. The Raptors have also looked into internal options with Nick Nurse, Rex Kalamian and G-League coach Jerry Stackhouse. Hopefully, they have a hire well before the NBA Draft.

            The Cavs did not declare if Kevin Love (head) is in the concussion protocol on Friday night.
        
        
             This is important to note because if he's in the protocol, it'll be really tough for Love to play in Game 7 due to all the testing. Love hurt his head in the middle of the first quarter, was ruled out for the game at half, and the Cavs didn't provide much of an update at all after the game. Considering Love had two concussions since 2016, it's possible he's out. That would mean Jeff Green likely starts with more Larry Nance.

             GOAT? Make that his 13th playoff game with at least a 40/10/5 line in his career, which is way more than anyone else in the last 50 years (Michael Jordan had four, per basketballreference.com). He's also been unreal in elimination games with either a 40-point game or a triple-double in each of his last seven of such games. LeBron did tweak his lower right leg after Larry Nance fell on him, but James stayed in the game because he's LeBron James. He hasn't missed any of his 234 playoff games in his career, and now he'll be playing in his 100th game of the season on Sunday. We're going to Game 7, baby.

            J.R. Smith scored five points with three rebounds, one block and one 3-pointer in 38 minutes against the Celtics on Friday.
        
        
             He did tweak his right ankle as his foot made contact with Marcus Smart's foot, but Smith stayed in the game and looked fine. If Kevin Love does need to miss time, Smith would likely have more shots coming his way to help space the floor. He hasn't played well in Boston, so that would have to change.

            Jeff Green scored 14 points with three rebounds, two assists, two blocks and one 3-pointer in 31 minutes against the Celtics on Friday.
        
        
             He started the second half for Kevin Love (head) and gave the Cavs some of his best minutes of the series. Green had been playing well against the Raptors, but he was losing minutes up until today. He was terrific in the post on offense to take at least a little pressure of LeBron James, and he was in the right spots on D. Coach Ty Lue would almost certainly have to extend Green's minutes while Love is on the shelf. He'd be a DFS play on Sunday.

            Larry Nance scored 10 points with seven rebounds, one assist, two steals and no turnovers in 22 minutes against the Celtics on Friday.
        
        
             The Cavs bench with LeBron was the difference in the second quarter with Nance getting plenty of time in the paint on both ends. Coach Ty Lue said earlier in the week that Nance knows his role now, but that role could expand now that Kevin Love (head) is banged up. Nance almost certainly would come off the bench regardless, but he could hit minutes around 20-25 with Love out.

             He was 10-of-16 from the field and made both free throws to get him to a sterling 1.56 points per possession. The Cavs were really limiting Al Horford on screen-and-roll plays, so that helped get Rozier open. Maybe the Cavs dared Rozier to shoot the ball because of his road woes, so perhaps they won't have a similar plan in Game 7. He's been awesome at home all postseason.

             He was on a heater in the first quarter, scoring 15 of Boston's 25 points with Brown scoring the final nine of the frame. Brown was extremely aggressive on the offensive end and he didn't turn the ball over, but it wasn't his best defensive game. If Marcus Morris plays poorly again, Brown may have to defend LeBron James more, which could hurt his offensive output.

             He collided with Kevin Love in the first quarter and he may have tweaked his left shoulder or taken a slight hit to the head. Tatum wasn't nearly as aggressive for about two quarters after that, but he eventually started getting to the rim in the fourth. He thrived in Game 5, so he could have a signature moment in Game 7.

             The Cavs really focused on taking Horford out of the game as they stuck with him on pick-and-roll plays -- that partially explains why the guards fared well. A downside on the Kevin Love (head) injury is that Horford may have a tougher time scoring, especially after a strong game from Jeff Green on defense -- yes, we know that sounds weird. He did play well in the previous two, so maybe he gets back on track in Game 7 in Boston.

Love had a concussion back in March, had another one back in the 2016 NBA Finals, and has a history beyond that, too. Luckily for the Cavs tonight, Jeff Green and Larry Nance have stepped up. That'll continue tonight while Love is questionable to play on Sunday.

             Jayson Tatum's left shoulder caught Love in the head and he called for a sub right away while he was on the ground. He was down for at least a minute and had the training staff look at him. After he got up, he went to the bench first to sit down, and then went to the locker room. He's likely getting a concussion check, so we'll have an update shortly.

             Muscle Watch: Hearsay Edition? Ingram has been expected to add some weight this summer in hopes he can play more four. His thinner frame may also have affected his health this season. The Lakers almost certainly won't be trading him unless it's to set up a super-team roster. If he can improve his shooting, he could take a step forward in fantasy.

             No details yet on how far along Giles is, but he probably isn't 100 percent after the Kings ruled him out for the season in January. The Kings took a chance on one of the best high school prospects, and they knew they weren't going to get much out of him last year. Maybe he plays in summer league.

             This is good news for Chriss after he admitted that he slacked off last summer. Chriss said he put on weight last summer, which both the team and he cited as part of the reason his season got off to a bumpy start. Maybe he can turn it around, but he will have to prove it after a colossal letdown last year.

             Iggy's already missed the last two games and could potentially miss Game 6 as well, which is not good news for Golden State. The Warriors play better with him, especially against the Rockets. If he does miss Game 6, expect Kevon Looney to remain in the starting role. We'll know more tomorrow as game-time approaches.

             With Chris Paul being out due to a right hamstring strain, it's no surprise Gordon will get the start here. It's Gordon's first start of the playoffs and the Rockets will need him to step up to replace how well CP3 has played over the last couple of games. Paul's status going forward is still uncertain, so Gordon could also start on Monday in Game 7 if the Warriors win Game 6 on Saturday.

            Chris Paul will not play in Game 6 on Saturday against Golden State due to a right hamstring strain.
        
        
             CP3 tweaked his right hamstring late in the fourth quarter of Game 5 on Thursday. He'll be re-evaluated again once the team returns to Houston, but this is not the news that the Rockets wanted to hear. Eric Gordon will have to step up on the offensive end in a major way, which he's shown he can do. This season when Paul and James Harden were sitting, Gordon averaged 34.6 points and 6.5 assists per 40 minutes. He played 36 minutes in Game 5, his most of this postseason. Expect somewhere around there again in Game 6.

             Larkin hasn't played all series and wasn't expected to, so the game plan will not change for the Celtics. He's doubtful for the rest of the series if it were to be extended to a Game 7.

Lillard was recently named to the All-NBA First Team, and is looking for a follow-up meeting with Allen to discuss the possibility of bringing in high profile free agents to prime the Blazers for a deep playoff run. After a great regular season, followed by a season-ending sweep at the hands of the six-seed Pelicans, you can't blame him.

             It was an absolutely brutal game and now Harden has missed 20 treys in a row, including 11 misses tonight to tie him with John Starks in 1994 for most 3-point attempts without a make in a playoff game. Harden is going to have to play better in the rest of this series because of Chris Paul (hamstring) likely being limited or out. He may also have to see more Andre Iguodala (leg). Even though the Rockets have a 3-2 lead, you could argue they're the underdogs to win this series unless we get good news on CP3.

            Kevin Durant scored 29 points with four rebounds, one block and three 3-pointers in 40 minutes during a 98-94 loss to the Rockets in Game 5 on Thursday.
        
        
             Again, the passing wasn't there with 18 dimes tonight and 14 in Game 4 -- they averaged 29.3 per game in the regular season. Coach Steve Kerr was getting on his guys to cut and Kerr said after the game that his offense was better today than Tuesday. Kerr also told KD to ""trust these guys"" during a timeout, but afterwards said throwing the ball to KD is a good option. Isolation ball has been a big part of the GS struggles, and KD was really struggling to get good shots late. Besides that, turnovers were costly with 16, including a team-high six from Draymond Green. This is hardly the Warriors team we saw in the playoffs last year.

             It took eight minutes of game action for Curry to get his first shot from the field, which just can't happen. The Warriors still can't get back to their bread-and-butter offense with Steph at the helm and their passes doing the work, and all the credit goes to the Rockets. Maybe that'll change in Game 6 on Saturday.

             Coach Steve Kerr really mixed up his rotation with David West and Quinn Cook entering, and Nick Young moving out of the rotation until very late. Looney's usage rate was 0.0 in the first half, and the Rockets seem to know that the non-stars won't be shooting. Looney played much better in the second half, but he could be moving to the bench on Saturday, especially if Andre Iguodala returns. The Warriors miss Iggy big time.

             He was off in the first with just seven points, but Thompson was defending well and looked healthy. He was doing a little more offensively than usual, and that may have to continue because of how the Rockets seem to have figured out the GSW offense.

             This is not good. Paul was grabbing his right hammy after he fell down, but he had a wrap over his left hammy on the bench. His left hamstring was the bad one this season and CP3 looked upset on the bench, so this is troubling news and could keep him out. Worst yet, CP3 saved the day with a strong second half, finishing with 20 points, seven rebounds, six assists, three steals and four 3-pointers. Expect several updates in the next day.

It did not work out for the Warriors in Game 4 and burned them in the fourth, but Looney is the most familiar among the available players with the four All-Stars with his 40 minutes in that five-man unit during this series. Kerr did hint he'll tweak his rotation, so we could see more Jordan Bell or even Quinn Cook over Nick Young.

             No surprise here after coach Steve Kerr said Klay was moving around well on Wednesday. Thompson did also play through his knee injury on Tuesday and there was never really much concern he'd even be limited, especially considering Klay's durability. He'll likely have to play a ton of minutes with Andre Iguodala (leg) out for this one.

             He gets ruled out before warmups, which is potentially bad news for Game 6, as well. The Warriors are really short on wings and they may have to roll with Shaun Livingston and Nick Young to help more. Plus, we'll almost certainly see Jordan Bell, who may get 20 minutes. Kevon Looney figures to start and get minutes in the 20s, but coach Steve Kerr could change that.

             This report is about as credible as it gets, but Iguodala is still going to be a game-time call and maybe this changes after warmups. Coach Steve Kerr said Iguodala did improve on Wednesday, and Iggy did get shots up at shootaround today. If he isn't a go, that means Jordan Bell would likely have to play more minutes again while Nick Young could help. It's possible Kevon Looney doesn't make another start, but he should still get decent run.

             Both KAT and Oladipo earn their first All-NBA honors with Jimmy Butler getting his second of his career, which may be a slight surprise due to Butler not hitting 60 games and his team barely making the postseason. Butler did finish with 54 points in the voting, which tied Chris Paul and was just over Rudy Gobert (51), but those two played different positions to keep them off the All-NBA squads. Curry did lead the Third Team with 164 points, which put him just behind DeMar DeRozan (165) on the second team. PG-13 also picked up his fourth All-NBA nod.

             When asked about Iggy's status Steve Kerr said, ""Incremental progress. Still a game-time decision."" Iguodala was out for Game 4 and it clearly had an impact on the Warriors as they lost their first home game since the 2016 NBA Finals. It'll be a tough test to go without him on the road if he's sidelined for Game 5.

             Stoudemire says he's been training as if he was returning to the NBA. Though 35 isn't an outrageous age to still be playing, he hasn't played a game in the Association in over two years. In his last season, 2015-16 with the Heat, he only averaged 5.8 points and 4.3 rebounds so there's probably no reason to go running to draft him in your league if he does make a return.

They haven't won more than 35 games or made the playoffs since the 2011-12 season, so you can't blame them for taking their time with this coaching search.

             After making a 3-pointer the big man said, ""There's a difference between you can't shoot and you're not allowed."" This is not the first time Whiteside has showed frustration or that he's unhappy with the Heat organization. There are growing rumors that the Heat attempt to trade him this offseason. Makes sense, as his minutes took a heavy hit down the stretch in the season and and he averaged only 15.4 minutes per game in the Heat's five-game series with the Sixers. His contract could get in the way of a trade, though.

The Pistons have recently hired Grizzlies executive Ed Stefanski as a senior advisor and he will be responsible for this coaching hire.

Head coach Ty Lue said about LeBron, ""He looked a little tired to me, yes."" The King will have to shake off his lack of energy or his seven-year Finals streak will come to an end. Expect LeBron to bring it and have one of his signature elimination games on Friday.

             With his 24, Tatum has now scored the fourth most points (312) by a rookie in postseason history. He only needs 41 more points to pass Kareem Abdul-Jabbar for the most ever by a rookie. The rook continues to emerge as a star and is now one win away from a trip to the NBA Finals.

             The Celtics are coming off two straight losses in Cleveland, so coach Brad Stevens opted to switch things up. The Cavs pounded Boston on the glass in Games 3 and 4 and Stevens is likely betting that Baynes will help neutralize Tristan Thompson's impact on the boards, while providing superior rim protection.

""He has been in there pretty much every day I have been in here around this time. You can tell he is taking the weight room a lot more serious and that is going to help him by allowing him to recover faster and hopefully next year be on the court more because of that weight room."" Ball missed 30 games his rookie year, so hopefully, bulking up some will help him stay on the court more during his second NBA season.

            Adrian Wojnarowski doubts that the Timberwolves will try to trade Karl-Anthony Towns this summer.
        
        
             ""I think their owner would trade management/the coach before they would trade Karl-Anthony Towns,"" Wojnarowski said. ""I don’t think they would allow that. I just don’t believe they’d allow that kind of decision."" There have been some rumors floated around recently that KAT is at odds with management, but it would make zero sense for the Wolves to try and move their franchise center, particularly with him eligible for an extension this summer.

            Chris Paul had been dealing with pain in his right foot since Game 2 of the Western Conference Finals, but he doesn't plan on taking any time off.
        
        
             ""It's about as good as it's going to be right now,"" Paul said. ""But for us, it's not about that. It's about going out there and getting stops and making big plays when we needed to."" CP3 looked off during Game 3 when he didn't get his first shot to fall until the third quarter, but he was crucial in Houston's Game 4 win with 27 points on 10-of-20 shooting and acknowledged he was feeling much better. He's still not quite 100%, but he's determined to continue to fight through the pain.

            Klay Thompson played through his sore left knee, but was a bit gimpy on his way to just 10 points on 4-of-13 shooting with two 3-pointers in Tuesday's 95-92 loss to the Rockets.
        
        
             Thompson's knee injury aside, he was in the spotlight near the end of the game as Kevin Durant curiously decided to pass the ball to him, despite Klay being trapped in the corner and with Durant only needing a two-pointer to tie the game. Thompson didn't get much of a shot off and Stephen Curry missed a shot at the final buzzer that gave the Rockets the unlikely win. Hopefully Thompson is good to go for Thursday's Game 5 in Houston, as the Warriors are probably going to need him.

             Curry put on a clinic in the third quarter and finished with 28 points, six rebounds, two assists, two steals and six 3-pointers on 10-of-26 shooting in 39 minutes on Tuesday. Curry also got a last-second opportunity after Chris Paul oddly made a free throw with 0.5 seconds left on the clock, but couldn't get it to go down. It was, however, a bit shocking to see him as wide open as he was, and Curry was probably as surprised as anyone, as well. Game 5 is Thursday night in Houston.

            Kevin Durant had 27 points, 12 rebounds, three assists and a 3-pointer on 9-of-24 shooting in 43 minutes of Tuesday's 95-92 loss to the Rockets, and made an interesting decision to pass the ball to an ailing Klay Thompson with the game on the line in the closing seconds.
        
        
             With the Warriors only down two points in the final 10 seconds, and with a timeout remaining, Durant had the ball and could have worked his way to the basket, or at least found an open man, but chose to pass the ball to Thompson, who was already dealing with a sore knee. Additionally, Thompson was trapped in the corner and had no chance of getting off a good shot, making Durant's pass look even worse. The series is knotted at 2-2 with Game 5 set for Houston on Thursday night. But if this series ends poorly for the Warriors, critics will look back to Durant's decision at the end of Game 4 as a big reason why it happened.

             Paul helped the Rockets go on a 25-12 run to end the game and was the most amped player on the court when it was over, but he curiously made a free throw with 0.5 seconds remaining that left the door open for GSW, but Steph Curry's open look at the buzzer was off target. After Curry led the Warriors to a 34-17 rout in the third quarter it looked like this game, and series, were over, but the Rockets pulled off a miracle. James Harden led the Rockets with 30 points in the win and Game 5 is in Houston on Thursday night.

The Warriors diagnosed with him a left knee strain, but it must be pretty minor because they cleared him to play after just a few minutes in the locker room.

             He was upgraded from doubtful to questionable on Tuesday morning, but after receiving treatment and getting some shots up during warmups, the Warriors ruled him out. ""If he was close, he'd play,"" coach Steve Kerr said. ""He's injured. We'll see what happens in a couple days."" In typical Kerr fashion, the Warriors aren't expected to reveal his replacement in the starting five until a few minutes before tip-off. With that said, Kevon Looney is the favorite to draw the start.

             An X-ray and MRI confirmed that Iguodala is not dealing with any structural damage, so his ability to play will likely be a matter of pain tolerance. He has received treatment on his leg several times over the past 24 hours, and he said if he does play he'll likely be rocking a pad on his left leg. He's headed for a game-time call, but if he does sit this one out, Kevon Looney would likely replace him in the starting five and there would be more minutes available for Nick Young.

""The bottom line is that obviously we'd like to have him back on our team,"" Gentry said on Monday.

            Donte DiVincenzo said he expects to remain in the 2018 NBA draft.
        
        
             DiVincenzo, like all other underclassmen on the fence, has until May 30th before deciding whether to withdraw his name from the draft pool. Last week, he was reportedly looking for a first-round guarantee. After excelling in scrimmages at the combine in Chicago and testing off the charts, he's likely received the guarantee he was looking for. He'll likely land somewhere in the 20's.

            The Timberwolves have ""taken some calls"" on Karl-Anthony Towns, according to Brian Windhorst of ESPN.
        
        
             Earlier this week on his podcast, ESPN's Zach Lowe said that Towns and the Wolves were ""not in a good place."" Windhorst reports that he doesn't think the Wolves are looking to trade KAT, but ""teams are definitely sniffing around."" It seems extremely unlikely that Minnesota would seriously consider moving Towns, but stranger things have happened. We will certainly keep an eye on this situation over the summer.

Incredibly, Giannis is still just 23 years old. Coach Budenholzer wants the Greek Freak to take his game to the next level. ""He's a smart player,"" Budenholzer said.

""Obviously there’s a lot of conversations and in a free agent market, it’s hard to predict. Dante’s done his job, he’s had some unfortunate things happen.

             As we know, Leonard only played in nine games last season and decided to rehab his quad injury in New York. Thus, he was not with the Spurs on the bench during the playoffs, which rubbed many in the organization the wrong way. However, the fact remains that Kawhi is one of the five best all-around players on the planet. Starting July 1st, the Spurs can offer a five-year, $219 million contract.

He'll have to improve on his 3-of-12 shooting if the Cavs are going to pull off a road win. Love did have a highlight full court pass to LeBron that he dropped on a dime past multiple Celtics defenders.

            Patrick McCaw (back) is unlikely to make it back to the court this postseason.
        
        
             He's improving, but it's been a slow recovery process and at this stage in the postseason it would be tough to re-incorporate McCaw back into the lineup. He was having a down year anyway, so there are no guarantees he'd be a significant part of the rotation at this stage, even if healthy.

             ""I'm OK, I'm OK. Trying to get treatment and all of that and be ready for tomorrow,"" said Paul. When asked specifically what he's dealing with, Paul replied: ""No, I'm cool. Just trying to figure out what we can do to make adjustments to win Game 4."" CP3 did not look 100% during Sunday's Game 3 loss, and he was seen getting worked on early in the game while he was on the bench, but obviously, this won't be an issue that forces him to miss any game-time action.

             Iguodala hurt his left knee during the closing seconds of Sunday's Game 3 win, and it sounds like it may have swelled up on him overnight. He's headed for an X-ray and we'll be awaiting those results, but we'll have a better idea on his status following Tuesday morning's shootaround. If Iguodala is forced to sit out Tuesday's game, Kevon Looney would likely move into the starting lineup and there would be more minutes available for guys like Nick Young and Shaun Livingston. Stay tuned.

             It may be nothing, but Cousins was caught liking an Instagram comment that said he should be paid the max. The Mavs would more than likely offer that if talks were to get serious. As for Jordan, everyone remembers his fiasco with the Mavs and Clips back in 2015 when he went back on his verbal agreement to go to Dallas, so it comes as somewhat of a surprise they would still be interested. Randle's decision will be affected by how the Lakers handle his restricted free agency.

The Lakers had the opportunity to extend Randle's contract by October 2017 but didn't. He wore a hoodie to a game this season that said ""Pay Me"" on it, so clearly it rubbed him the wrong way. Randle is a restricted free agent, but the Mavericks are one team that are expected to pursue him. He played all 82 games in 2017-18 and averaged 16.1 points and 8.0 boards per game.

             Sacramento and Atlanta could both be looking to add big men to improve their frontcourts.

Even though LeBron James didn't have another 40-point triple-double, he dominated the game and led the Cavs to a convincing win. Morris and all the Celtics clearly have to do better on defense in Game 4, which could be a tough test away from home as the C's are just 1-5 on the road these playoffs.

             Capela opened the game with a pair of easy buckets at the rim, but Draymond Green and the Warriors' defense held him at bay after that early flurry. The Rockets really struggled in the first half with 10 turnovers and 14 missed shots in the paint, including a ton of layups, and Mike D'Antoni opted to go small to claw back from a double-digit deficit -- it didn't work. Capela's rim protection was sorely missed when he was out of the game, and it will be interesting to see what D'Antoni does in Game 4 -- Capela had played at least 27 minutes in every playoff game prior to tonight.

            James Harden led the Rockets with 20 points on Sunday, adding nine assists, five rebounds and two 3-pointers in a blowout Game 3 road loss.
        
        
             Golden State closed the first quarter on an 11-0 run, then opened the second half with another 10-0 spurt to claim a 21-point lead. The Rockets never got within single-digits after that and wound up losing by 41 points, which was the largest margin of defeat in franchise playoff history. Harden made 7-of-16 field goals and 4-of-5 free throws, but he also committed four of his team's 19 turnovers. The Rockets will need much more from their MVP to even the series at 2-2 on Tuesday.

             Gordon checked in early and logged 31 minutes, but couldn't duplicate his playoff career-high 27-point eruption from Game 2. P.J. Tucker also cooled off with six points, six boards and zero defensive stats in 33 minutes, Trevor Ariza had six points on 2-of-6 shooting, and the result was a 126-85 shellacking in Oracle Arena. Rockets coach Mike D'Antoni said afterward that his team ""played soft"" tonight, and they'll only have one day to regroup before Game 4.

             Kevon Looney has earned his minutes and when he got into early foul trouble, it was Jordan Bell who got the call off the bench. West averaged 16.0 minutes in the first round vs. San Antonio, but his lack of mobility makes him an awkward fit vs. the small-ball Rockets. He was the only player not to leave the bench tonight, as even JaVale McGee and Zaza Pachulia earned a few minutes in garbage time.

             Draymond shot 3-of-9 from the field but he was spectacular otherwise, going 3-of-3 from the line with one 3-pointer, one steal, one block and only one turnover in 37 minutes. He's notched at least 10/10/5 in 22 postseason games, which is fourth-most in the league since 2000 -- he trails only Tim Duncan, Kevin Garnett and LeBron James. As a side note, Dray also picked up his third technical foul of the playoffs tonight, but he's still four techs away from a one-game suspension.

             With this performance, Klay moved past Rick Barry into second-place on the Warriors' all-time postseason scoring list (1,786 points). He said before the game that Golden State was ready to erase the memory of their Game 2 loss, ""to redeem ourselves in our fans' eyes, in our eyes and in our coaching staff's eyes."" After regaining control of the series with a 41-point win tonight, it's safe to say they achieved that goal.

             Steph was a combined 2-of-13 from deep in Games 1 and 2, and began this game 1-of-6 in the first quarter alone, which tied his playoff career-high for 3-point misses in a single quarter. He couldn't be stopped after halftime, however, and got his offense going despite being relentlessly targeted on defense. Before the game, Steve Kerr dismissed concerns about the health of Curry's knee, saying, ""Steph is healthy, he’s moving fine ... Steph and Oracle [Arena], it’s a good combination."" Sure enough, he served up some home cooking tonight and helped Golden State earn their 16th straight home playoff victory.

Even if he's in the rotation, he'll likely be on a short leash in Game 3.

             At just 19 years old, Doncic helped lead Real Madrid to Euroleague gold in addition to coming home with the Rising Star, Final Four MVP and the Euroleague MVP awards. The young man looked confident playing on the biggest stage in Europe, did a nice job of pushing the rock in transition, and overall, he's looked very polished on both ends of the floor. He's expected to officially declare for the NBA draft soon and he'll be a lock to go within the top 5 on draft day.

             Larkin appeared to have the full range of motion in his sprained left shoulder, and wasn't grimacing at all when taking contact, so this is a very positive step in the right direction. He's not expected to play in Game 4 on Monday in Cleveland, but it sounds like there's a decent shot he could be back in action for Wednesday's Game 5 in Boston. If he is able to return to the court, he'll cut into Semi Ojeleye's minutes.

             Ganguli adds that the Lakers would prefer to keep their young core together and that they aren't actively shopping anyone. The Lakers have been preserving their cap space for the free agent market in 2018 and 2019 and have been linked to names such as LeBron James, Paul George and DeMarcus Cousins. For what it's worth, Magic Johnson deemed Brandon Ingram as ""untouchable"" last summer.

             As impressive as this was, it should be noted that it was four inches less than his 44.5-inch vertical last year. Diallo was the mystery man in the 2017 Draft and was projected to be a late first rounder, but his stock  fell after a letdown of a season at Kentucky. He's loaded with athleticism, has a 6'11"" wingspan and his shot is reportedly improving, but it's no secret that he's a bit raw. Teams that want to take a gamble on the 19-year-old wing probably won't have to pounce until the second round.

We'd expect most teams to accept their calls except for the Bulls after they robbed them of Jordan Bell.

            Joel Embiid said his goal is to be the league MVP in 2018-19.
        
        
             ""I feel like next year is definitely going to be a type of MVP season for me,"" he said. ""But it starts with my body. And the skills.  I love being in the gym. I don’t feel like taking any time off."" This will be his first summer without restrictions since 2014, and Embiid added that he wants to get his playing weight down to 270 -- he was around 281 in 2017-18. Embiid ran out of gas at times during the postseason, so it's not a surprise that conditioning is an area of focus.

             The Cavs had a double-digit lead for 42 minutes during this wire-to-wire victory, but LeBron stayed in the game until 6:49 with the Cavs up 30 -- their biggest lead of the night. He's never been down 0-3 in a playoff series and that's still true after the Cavs were run out of Boston to start this series. LeBron cited the defense in this win, but he didn't mention that the Celtics weren't as locked in as they were in the first two. The Celtics still haven't lost a postseason game at home in these playoffs, so the Cavs will have some work to do even if they can hold serve at The Q on Monday.

             The three ball was not the friend of the Cavs coming into this game with just 14 made combined in the first two vs. Boston, but they topped that amount with ease thanks to 17 today. Korver himself topped his output with only three in the first two, but he did come in hot from deep vs. Toronto with his 8-of-11 in Game 3 and 4. Everyone knows a key to LeBron James' success is his shooters knocking 'em down, so that helps explains this beatdown.

             After the Cavs guards were crushed by their Boston counterparts, Hill set the tone early with 11 points in the first quarter to help the Cavs take a 32-17 lead after 12 minutes. Hill typically has strong starts when he has good games, so him slowing down after the strong start isn't a surprise. He really needed this one after Scary Terry Rozier roasted him. Expect heavy minutes for Hill going forward, especially now that he looks totally healthy.

             He's been much better at home in the playoffs, but the Youngstown, Ohio guard couldn't get it going near his hometown.

He'll be better going forward.

He had himself a solid season as a freshman with 19.2 points and 3.6 dimes per game.

""My main focus isn’t necessarily to be the best player in this draft. My goal is to be the best player in the NBA. That’s what I’m focusing on,"" said Young. However, he wore down over the second half of the season. The biggest knocks on his game are his propensity for turnovers and his lack of defense. Young could go as early as sixth overall to Orlando, and likely won't slide outside the top 10.

             VanVleet, who will hit free agency in July, exceeded expectations during his sophomore season in Toronto, averaging 8.6 points, 2.4 rebounds and 3.2 assists. He will receive heavy interest on the open market. However, he says he would prefer to stay put. ""I’m going to be loyal to the organization that gave me a chance and I love the city of Toronto, I love the fans, I love the people here, and I would love to be back."" said VanVleet. ""So hopefully it can work out.""

             ""I think if you look around the NBA, as far as the veteran players, there are probably a few players we'd consider trading the pick for, not ... just pick for player No. 1. So it'll be a busy month for us,"" McDonough said. Last summer, the Suns surprised most of us when they said they likely wouldn't compete for at least two seasons, but back in January McDonough said he's planning on aggressively pursuing free agents this summer. It would be a major shock to see the Suns unload the pick, but don't underestimate them doing something foolish wild.

To be very clear here, there is nothing to report on a trade even being close, so just keep this in mind in July.

            Donovan Mitchell is still in a walking boot, but ""everything is fine"" with the foot according to Jazz reporter Tony Jones.
        
        
             Mitchell injured himself in the closing moments of Utah's Game 5 loss to the Rockets earlier this month. He's been in a boot since, but both Mitchell and the Jazz have downplayed the injury. The sensational rookie should be ready to start offseason workouts shorty.

Sampson was an assistant coach in Milwaukee while John Hammond and Jeff Weltman were the Bucks GM and assistant GM, respectively.

             There has been some speculation that Curry is playing at far less than 100 percent due to his struggles over the first two games of the Western Conference Finals. He is averaging 17.0 points, while shooting 44.1 percent from the floor and 15.4 percent from downtown. However, Steph says the knee is not an issue. ""I feel good,"" said Curry. ""It’s something that you can’t shake off because of how recent the injury was. But I’m out there. I feel great, and I’m not worried about anything with my knee. I keep saying the same thing. I feel good.""

On ESPN during the combine coverage, he said he learned how to score more off screens on the perimeter. That should help him as he could be a lottery pick in June.

             On Nov. 22, Porter had a successful microdiscectomy of his L3-L4 spinal discs, which kept him to just three games as a freshman at Missouri. Porter was widely viewed as a top-three player in the draft coming into the year thanks to a prototype frame with a seven-foot wingspan on his 6'10"" body, but he does have his injury concerns. He'll likely be going in the top 10.

He also looked good early in the scrimmages today, but being a little undersized likely takes him out of the lottery. The reigning Most Outstanding Player in the NCAA tourney has helped himself since March.

Allen did only have a 32.5-inch standing vert, but he's still putting up better numbers than expected and even mentioned his comparison to J.J. Redick. ""I don’t think J.J. jumped 40 inches,"" Allen said. The four-year Duke guard is likely going to be an option in the 25-45 range.

Doncic does sound like he should be coming over this year, but obviously teams will want to be fairly certain he's headed to the states. If he did stay in Europe, the team would still hold his draft rights a la Dario Saric. Chances are we won't find out anything particular on Doncic until June.

             ""[We] saw flashes of Cheick Diallo this year,"" Pelicans GM Dell Demps said. ""We're hoping those guys (Diallo and Frank Jackson) can be impact players for us next year. The potential is definitely there, the work ethic is there."" Demps added that Diallo will play in the Summer League and that the Pelicans will find a way to integrate him into their plans. He averaged 6.9 points and 6.1 rebounds in his final 19 games of the season, stepping up in the absence of DeMarcus Cousins. His fantasy outlook for 2018-19 hinges on what the Pelicans do with Boogie Cousins in free agency.

             After firing coach of the year Dwane Casey, the Raptors were heavily linked to Mike Budenholzer before he joined the Bucks. Nick Nurse and Rex Kalamian were both assistants on Casey's staff and are in the running, while Jerry Stackhouse is a candidate for the job as well.

""We have yet to make this decision. Perhaps after the season.""

""Obviously it wasn’t Steph’s best night,"" head coach Steve Kerr said. ""I’m not worried about Steph ... He’s feeling good ... He’s getting better."" It's only a matter of time before he goes Steph mode and erupts from downtown, and he'll have three full days to rest before Game 3. On the defensive end, the Rockets targeted Curry as the primary defender 23 times, a postseason high, trying to capitalize on Curry's defensive weaknesses.

            The finalists for the 2017-18 Most Improved Player award are Spencer Dinwiddie, Clint Capela and Victor Oladipo.
        
        
             Domantas Sabonis and Steven Adams are notable exclusions from the list, but it's hard to argue with the three finalists. As strong as Capela and Dinwiddie were this year, it's almost a given that Oladipo will go home with the award. The Nets will undoubtedly retain Dinwiddie by guaranteeing his $1.7 million salary for the 2018-19 season, but he's not a lock to duplicate his top-100 fantasy finish -- a lot depends on Jeremy Lin's health, and the Nets' willingness to run small-ball lineups with Lin, Dinwiddie and D'Angelo Russell.

Tatum is a longshot here, despite his terrific play in the postseason, and it's widely considered a two-man race between Simmons and Mitchell.

Detroit is casting a wide net in their search for talent in the wake of Stan Van Gundy's exit -- SVG was serving as both head coach and GM, so there's a big void to fill.

I don't even know if I know right now."" Golden State stole homecourt advantage with a 119-106 win in Game 1 on Monday, so there's no pressure on Kerr to tweak that lineup featuring Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson, Andre Iguodala, Kevin Durant and Draymond Green. If any change is made, it would be Iguodala heading to the bench.

             It's a four-year contract and it didn't take long for Budenholzer to land another head coaching job after parting ways with the Hawks in late April. He's previously been connected to the Raptors and Knicks, but will instead take over a coveted position for the young and talented Bucks, hoping to push Giannis Antetokounmpo and company into championship contention. He compiled a 213-197 record (.520) in five seasons with Atlanta, including Coach of the Year honors in 2015, and it's a strong hire for the ascendant Bucks.

             He picked up a Flagrant 1 for pushing Al Horford in the back while he was mid-air and off balance, and then got into a shoving match with Marcus Smart, which could have resulted in an ejection and another flagrant after pushing Smart in the face. The flagrant also killed the small amount of momentum the Cavs were trying to muster while down just eight in the fourth quarter, allowing the Celtics to easily finish off the Cavs. Smith wasn't exactly engaged in the second half of this game and is now averaging 2.0 points on 2-of-16 shooting after two games in the series.

             How Hill tied Jeff Green with the team lead in blocks, while Tristan Thompson and Kevin Love didn't have one, remains a mystery, but he'll have to play better on both ends of the floor if the Cavs are ever going to get a win in Boston in this series, assuming the Cavaliers are able to get a win at home on Saturday or Monday. Hill is now averaging a paltry 4.0 points, 1.0 rebounds, 0.5 assists and 0.0 steals in his two games of this series. Gross.

            Tristan Thompson started over Kyle Korver on Tuesday and hit 4-of-6 shots eight points, seven rebounds and nothing else in a 107-94 Game 2 loss to the Celtics.
        
        
             Thompson played better than several of his teammates, but simply doesn't have the skill set to make a huge impact offensively, while his lack of blocks wasn't helpful, either. The Cavs will probably continue to start him, simply because they need him to try to slow Al Horford down, but it didn't really work tonight.

At least on Tuesday, he was really the only other starter who showed up, although new starter Tristan Thompson at least hit 4-of-6 shots for eight points and seven rebounds.

            LeBron James bounced back from a poor Game 1 to hit 16-of-29 shots, 5-of-11 3-pointers and 5-of-10 free throws on his way to 42 points, 10 rebounds, 12 assists, a block and six turnovers in Tuesday's Game 2 loss to the Celtics.
        
        
             James scored 21 of Cleveland's 27 points in the first quarter, tying his playoff career high for points in a period. His 42 points marked his fifth 40-point game of this postseason, but he got very little support from his teammates tonight. This crew playing with LeBron looks suspiciously like the one that the Cavs shipped out of town when they made their midseason overhaul. Kevin Love was solid with 22 points and 15 boards, but George Hill, J.R. Smith, and almost every other Cavalier looked disinterested throughout the second half tonight. LeBron suffered a neck sprain that briefly knocked him out of the game, but he looked fine upon returning. The Celtics have never lost a playoff series after leading 2-0 and are undefeated at home this postseason, so LeBron clearly has his work cut out for him in this one.

             Smart had nine points, three boards, six assists, a steal and a 3-pointer in Sunday's Game 1, and combined with Terry Rozier to run circles around Cleveland's starting back court of George Hill and J.R. Smith (combined 1-for-11, 3 points). It's scary to think about how good this Celtics team would be with both Kyrie Irving and Gordon Hayward available, as well as how coach Brad Stevens would handle finding ample playing time for everyone.

             Rozier hit just 4-of-10 shots and scored eight points in Game 1, but took over Game 2 in the third quarter tonight. And while it's easy to wonder just how good the Celtics would be if they had Kyrie Irving and Gordon Hayward, it's also fair to wonder exactly how much trouble they'd be in if they didn't have Rozier and Marcus Smart available to fill in for their missing superstars.

             Johnson underwent surgery on April 30 and he's expected to resume basketball activities around mid-June. It seems like he's on track to meet that initial timetable, and he'll have plenty of time to get himself ready for the 2018-19 season. As a side note, his yearly salary will spike to $19.2 million next year, so maybe he'll start earning minutes in the 30s next year. Dwyane Wade would need to retire for that to be a realistic expectation, though.

             ""I want to be here,"" Favors said. ""I love my teammates, I love the organization. This is where I grew up. At the same time, I know that if I’m going to be here, there are certain sacrifices that I’m going to have to make. So, I just have to wait and see how things work out when the time comes."" It'll be interesting to see what sort of offers Favors receives on the open market, but he'll likely be sacrificing both money and playing time if he decides to remain with the Jazz.

             Curry acknowledged after Monday's Game 1 win in Houston that he tweaked ""something"" during the second half, but he played through it, and no one is suggesting he's dealing with anything serious. Curry could take it easy at Tuesday's practice, but he'll be fine for Game 2 on Wednesday.

            Alec Burks said he was as healthy as he’s been at the end of a season in several years.
        
        
             Burks had missed at least 40 games in each of the previous three seasons but was able to play in 64 contests for Utah in 2017-18. However, with Donovan Mitchell emerging as a star, and Royce O’Neale passing Burks in the rotation, his role next season will likely be limited. Burks has just one year left on his current contract, which may lead to Utah exploring trade opportunities this offseason or next February at the trade deadline.

             It was reported yesterday that Budenholzer was the focus of both the Milwaukee and Toronto coaching searches. Now it appears that Coach Bud and Messina, currently an assistant in San Antonio, are finalists for the Bucks job. The head coaching gig in Milwaukee is arguably the most attractive job available, as it is an opportunity to coach Giannis Antetokounmpo into his prime.

""I can't dunk it right now. I don't trust it yet,"" Mbah a Moute said. ""A lot of those plays, usually they are dunks, plays I had tonight. It was just like hesitating between dunking and trying to finish when guys are coming at you. It's a little tough, but I'll make that adjustment."" If LMAM can't snap out of his slump, the Rockets will be forced to remove him from the rotation.

             Patterson was surprisingly durable, playing in a team-high 82 games, but averaged career lows in field goal percentage, points, rebounds, assists and minutes per game. ""At the end of the day, it wasn't what I expected,"" Patterson said. ""It wasn't what my teammates and coaching staff expected, or even the fans."" When OKC initially signed Patterson, they viewed him as a starting PF. However, once they traded for Carmelo Anthony, P-Patt was bumped to the bench and was never able to find a comfort zone.

            The Suns are reportedly prepared to offer Clint Capela ""a max or near-max contract"" once free agency begins this offseason.
        
        
             Capela will be a restricted free agent this offseason, and Houston will most likely be matching any offer he receives on the open market, as owner Tilman Fertita has already said he's more than willing to go into the luxury tax to keep Chris Paul, Trevor Ariza, James Harden and Capela together. Capela has been lighting it up through the playoffs thus far with averages of 14.4 points, 12.2 rebounds and 2.8 swats per contest, so he'll assuredly be getting paid this summer.

             ""I don't know what the organization has in mind,"" said Schroder. ""That's why I'm going back in a week [to meet with management]. Of course, Atlanta is my city... but I have to look individually what's best for me... I will be 25 in September and of course, I want to win a title sometime. In my prime, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, I want to compete. I cannot be the second to last team in the Eastern Conference.""  Schroder also said it ""wouldn't be too bad"" to play for the Pacers or Bucks, so it'll be interesting to see what comes out of his upcoming meeting with management.

Coach Ty Lue said he's still ""weighing"" the decision, but cited Thompson's success against Al Horford in the past. In the nine minutes in which Horford and Thompson shared the floor in Game 1, Horford didn't have a single point or rebound.

""I had a whole season taken away. So just be smarter in the things that I do this summer in my workouts and not put the stress on my body but also try to protect my craft."" The Heat are loaded with wings, so if Dwyane Wade returns and Dion Waiters (ankle) comes back healthy it's going to be hard for McGruder to carve out a big role.

As a team, the Celtics starters outscored the Cavs starters 43-11 through the first 18 minutes of play, and they played some excellent team defense against Cleveland, holding them to just 36.0% shooting from the field and 15.4% from long-range.

""You can’t have better leadership than Al,"" head coach Brad Stevens said during his pregame presser, ""it’s as good as it gets.""

            Rodney Hood came off the bench for 11 points, two assists and nothing else over 19 minutes in Sunday's Game 1 loss to the Celtics.
        
        
             Hood checked in early with the Cavs struggling to get anything going offensively, but he wasn't really the ""sparkplug"" that Tyronn Lue was looking for, as he finished just 5-of-12 from the field. It looks like he's no longer in Lue's doghouse for refusing to enter Game 4 of the semis, though. Kyle Korver finished with five points, five rebounds, one steal, one block and one triple over 23 minutes and J.R. Smith (who is owed roughly $30 million over the next two years) recorded four points, one rebound, one assist and one steal in 29 minutes.

             Through the first 10 minutes of the game, LeBron James (five) and Love (four) were the only Cavs able to put points on the board, but Love got himself into some early foul trouble and was an absolute mess on the defensive end. He also struggled on the glass pulling down just three rebounds through the first half of action, and simply put, he’ll need to be much better in all aspects for Cleveland to have a shot of advancing to the Finals for the fourth year in a row.

             As a team, the Cavs seriously struggled to keep the Celtics out of the paint, which resulted in Cleveland heading into the second half with a 26-point deficit, accounting for the largest halftime deficit of LBJ’s postseason career thus far. The Celtics did a nice job of doubling up James whenever he had the ball in a good position and they forced The King to settle for a lot of long-range twos out of an isolation play, which resulted in a blowout loss for Cleveland.

             Smart's finger is swollen, but this obviously won't be anything that will keep him off the floor tonight, although it could affect his accuracy. Through eight games of postseason action, Smart has been connecting on just 34.2% of his shot attempts to go with averages of 10.6 points, 4.4 dimes, 1.8 steals, 1.0 block and 1.0 triple in 31.2 minutes per contest.

Hill hasn't been overly impressive throughout the playoffs thus far, but Smith and Korver have been deadly from beyond the arc while LBJ has gone into video game mode.

Brown will likely be looking at minutes in the 30s as a starter today, and it sounds like he's completely recovered from the hamstring issue that he dealt with during Boston's second-round series.

             ""Maybe I need to sit this whole season out,"" Bell wrote. ""I can get healthy."" Bell sent these texts when he was rehabbing from mid-January to mid-February and sent one again after rolling his ankle in a March 27th game against the Pacers. This could help explain why Bell went from four double-digit games and averaging 20.3 minutes, 7.7 points and 5.3 rebounds a game in December to only two double-digit games and averaging 13.6 minutes, 3.5 points 3.2 rebounds for the rest of the season from then on.

James and Ben Simmons would be an odd fit together while Joel Embiid's sky-high usage rate would obviously suffer. That said, no team should ever turn down one of the best players ever. He'll take on Boston on Sunday to kick off the Conference Finals.

             Well then. Brad Stevens also hinted that Morris could start out on LeBron, which makes sense because he did make two starts against him in the regular season. The Cavs did have an effective 116.4 offensive rating in the 55 possessions with Morris on LeBron, so it didn't work out too well. Regardless, Morris should get heavy minutes, assuming he can shoot the ball better than he did vs. Philly.

            Coach James Borrego said he sees Malik Monk as a playmaker who can play with Kemba Walker.
        
        
             ""And also be on the court without Kemba, creating offense for us,"" Borrego added. ""[Or] pairing him and Nic Batum in a lineup where Nic is facilitating."" Monk had himself a really nice April to finish his rookie season, averaging 20.4 points, 1.0 boards, 4.0 assists and 3.8 treys in those five. The Hornets won't be able to make major moves in free agency, so Monk should be looking at minutes in the 20s unless the Hornets land a top-three lotto pick.

             ""We're going to play all the lineups,"" Stevens said. The lineup with Aron Baynes worked out against the 76ers because of Baynes hitting corner treys, but it's certainly possible they roll with Marcus Morris instead. It wouldn't be a surprise to see them go with Semi Ojeleye after his strong round against the Bucks. Morris is likely going to see minutes regardless, but Baynes could be tough to trust in DFS.

            The Wolves are interested in bringing back Derrick Rose, according to Jon Krawczynski of the Athletic.
        
        
             Wolves coach and president, Tom Thibodeau, took some heat for signing Rose at the end of last season, but Derrick played surprisingly well in the playoffs. Rose averaged 14.2 points (on 50.9 percent shooting), 2.6 assists and 1.4 treys during Minnesota's five-game series vs. Houston. Assuming he's willing to come back for the veteran's minimum, expect him to re-up with Minny. However, the issue is that Rose would eat into the playing time of Tyus Jones.

Hill played in an important role in Cleveland's sweep of Toronto in the second round, averaging 12.3 points (on 60.9 percent shooting) and 3.0 assists in 33 minutes over the final three games of the series. He will be matched up primarily against Terry Rozier in the conference finals.

He'll look to improve via some international experience in the offseason.

             Larkin wasn't a major contributor during the regular season, but he likely would have been asked to log some important minutes in the Eastern Conference Finals due to the Celtics limited depth. In their Game 5 win over the Sixers, coach Stevens essentially went with a seven-man rotation. It will be interesting to see if Stevens continues to play all of his main cogs 25-plus minutes per game.

Expect an extension to be announced sooner rather than later.

Encouraging signs aside, Young is likely going to be used situationally in this series.

I leave the hotel every morning at about 9:30 a.m. and don’t get back til about 6 p.m. We do a lot of running mechanics, physical therapy, a lift of some sort, and then court work for another few hours."" He'll be ready to go next year and the Celtics almost certainly have to start a small-ball lineup with Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum breaking out.

             ""Marcus [Morris] is big, strong, competitive guy, but you have to guard LeBron as a team,"" Stevens said. The Boston starting lineup isn't totally clear, but Morris makes a lot of sense next to Terry Rozier, Jaylen Brown, Jayson Tatum and Al Horford. During the season Morris made two starts with Kyrie Irving (knee) and Gordon Hayward (leg) being the only other starters not mentioned above. Morris also was second on the team with defensive possessions against LeBron on the year (Jaylen Brown). Expect Morris, Brown and Semi Ojeleye to be the main defenders on LeBron with some Al Horford mixed in depending on how Kevin Love is playing.

             ""It is not yet sure that I'll stay with the Spurs,"" Parker said. ""I am open to all proposals. I would like to make my entire career in San Antonio. The sport remains a business, and we will have to make choices. I have been 17 years with the Spurs. I would always be nostalgic, but it's not the end of the world if I change my club."" Parker will be a free agent next year, so it sounds like he'd prefer to do a two-year deal with a possible player option for the third. He'll be in the Hall of Fame five years after he retires.

             He needs it and Kobe Bryant would agree. In the postseason, Ben made a grand total of two shots outside of the paint at just 23.5 percent on his jumpers. Simmons also wasn't very good in the mid-range during the year, making 27.8 percent of those in the regular season. He won't be adding a 3-pointer next season, but he really needs to figure out how to extend his range to 15 feet. Regardless, he looks like a second-round player to draft in fantasy next year.

             Irving reportedly left Cleveland to be the man, so he may have to make his impact off the court. As far as his health goes, Irving is walking without crutches for almost a month and has been on the sidelines. He should be ready to roll for next season.

             He said he is looking to attack in the first 5-8 seconds while looking to keep the fouls way down on defense. The Hornets saw their pace jump to ninth in the NBA in 2017-18 from 19th in 2016-17, so maybe they can up it to fifth. Borrego also said he wants to maximize what he gets out of the current roster, which isn't really an option because of their cap issues.

With him out, there should be more minutes going to Semi Ojeleye, Marcus Smart and Marcus Morris. Jaylen Brown is not expected to have a minutes limit, too.

Pierce has been a part of The Process with the 76ers, and he was vocal in player development as the 76ers Summer League coach. Coach Brett Brown has been raving about him and Pierce is constantly coaching up players during games with emphasis on defense.

             Thompson will be eligible to sign an extension in July. If both sides agree to an extension, the new contract would go into effect in 2019-20 and keep him in Golden State for an additional four years. Surprisingly, Klay is reportedly willing to sign for around $23 million per season, or roughly $92 million over the life of the four-year pact. That's about $50 million less than he could get should he wait to hit the open market.

             It's safe to assume that Ujiri and the Raptors have a potential replacement or two lined up, as it is unlikely they would fire Dwane Casey, the 2017-18 Coach of the Year without some sort of backup plan. Assistant coach Nick Nurse and Raptors 905 (G-League) head coach Jerry Stackhouse are other possible candidates. Toronto would seem to be the ideal landing spot for Budenholzer, as this Raptors team is built to win right now.

            Sixers GM Bryan Colangelo said that the team will exercise T.J. McConnell's team option for the 2018-19 season.
        
        
             This was an easy decision for Philadelphia, as McConnell will earn just $1.6 million next season. He averaged 6.3 points, 3.0 rebounds, 4.0 assists and 1.2 steals in 22.4 minutes in 2017-18. He also started the final two games of their playoff series vs. Boston. However, if Markelle Fultz is healthy and active next season, T.J. will likely see his playing time diminish dramatically.

            ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski? is reporting that the Raptors have fired head coach Dwane Casey.
        
        
             Remarkably, Casey just finished leading the Raptors to a franchise-record 59 wins and the No. 1 seed in the Eastern Conference. Of course, Toronto's season ended in extremely disappointing fashion, as the Cavs swept them out of the postseason in the second round. Casey won't be out of work for long. He will have plenty of teams interested in bringing him in, assuming he wants to resume working right away.

             Fultz told reporters on Thursday that he would be ""open"" to playing in Las Vegas. It sure seems like a no-brainer for all involved. Fultz was limited to just 14 games in his rookie season due to a shoulder injury that impacted his shot and his confidence. Having the opportunity to play against NBA-level competition without the pressure that comes along with regular-season contests would be seemingly ideal for Fultz's growth and development.

While he may not be able to secure a fully-guaranteed contract this summer, he'll certainly have plenty of NBA teams interested.

             ""Minor things. But changing the whole shot, no,"" said Simmons when asked about tinkering with his form this summer. His inability to knock down jumpers, or even attempt shots outside of ten feet was a significant limitation in his game as a rookie. Last season, Simmons became the first guard in 30 years to log more than 2,500 minutes and not make a single 3-pointer. He also shot just 56.0 percent from the free-throw line. Some pundits have suggested he start shooting with his right hand, but Simmons is apparently not planning on making such a drastic change.

Bell has only played a handful of seconds in the first half of postseason games, but Kerr liked how he played. Bell did only play 18 minutes against the Rockets in the regular season with a -1.9 net rating, so he likely would only be used situationally. Kevon Looney is way ahead of him and is currently the sixth man.

             Sure. ""He's a Swiss Army knife-type of player that can guard multiple positions and you can run offense through him,"" Fizdale said. ""I think he can push the ball off the break a lot like Draymond Green plays. Obviously the thing I'm going to demand from Lance is to play defense like Draymond. And be a guy that's pushing to be a First Team All-Defender."" If Fizdale can turn Thomas into half of what Dray can do, just give him 2019 Coach of the Year right now.

He was unlikely to command a higher annual salary as a free agent, and is likely betting that he can lock up one more long-term deal in 2019. No matter where he's playing, he'll go undrafted in all but the deepest fantasy leagues.

He shot a brutal 32.1% from the field in the postseason, including 26.8% vs. Boston, but the Sixers have already committed to him long-term -- Covington and Joel Embiid are the only players with guaranteed salaries through 2021-22.

             McConnell got stuck defending Jayson Tatum repeatedly in the first half and Boston's rising star took full advantage, but otherwise Philly's 26-year-old guard was unimpeachable. He committed just one turnover in 38 minutes and helped limit Terry Rozier to 17 points on 4-of-15 shooting, finishing his postseason on a high note.

             Simmons had three dunks and a layup in Game 4, making all of his field goals in the restricted area, and he followed a similar script tonight -- he shot 8-of-15 from the field with all of his makes in the paint. Necessity may have forced coach Brett Brown to start T.J. McConnell for Games 4 and 5 in this series, but we're expecting Simmons to resume his full-time PG role again next season. After all, the Rookie of the Year candidate notched historic averages with 15.8 points, 8.2 assists, 8.1 rebounds, 1.7 steals and 0.9 blocks while helping Philly earn the No. 3 seed this year.

             The Celtics swarmed Redick at the 3-point line all night long -- he didn't attempt a triple until 24 seconds remained in the first half, and his first make came against a double-team late in the third quarter. He sank a clutch 3-pointer to keep Philly in the game at the bitter end but it was too little, too late.

            Dario Saric went off for 27 points, 10 rebounds, four assists and three 3-pointers during Philly's 114-112 loss in Boston on Wednesday, going 8-of-14 from the field in 40 minutes.
        
        
             Saric added a steal and a block and his stellar play nearly helped Philly force Game 6 before succumbing down the stretch. He hauled in four offensive boards, took advantage of mismatches vs. smaller players, and had a few beautiful passes to set up teammates in the paint. The Sixers' willingness to play Ben Simmons as a full-time PG was a blessing for Saric's fantasy value this season, and we're expecting similar top-75 value in 2018-19.

            Joel Embiid had 27 points, 12 rebounds, four assists and four blocks during Philly's Game 5 defeat in Boston on Wednesday, making 9-of-18 FGs and 9-of-11 FTs in 39 minutes.
        
        
             Embiid was fired up after getting called for a technical foul and being heckled by the Celtics' home crowd, and his third-quarter eruption helped Philly close to within a point heading into the fourth. He was stonewalled and lost possession on a crucial possession late tonight, but the Sixers did themselves no favors by committing five team fouls just two minutes into the fourth quarter. Philly can still take solace in having advanced to the Conference semifinals with a young core that's only getting better.

             As usual, Smart's frenetic defense and energy were crucial to Boston's success. He bullied the Sixers' guards in the post and attempted seven free throws in the first half alone, finishing 8-of-13 from the stripe. He followed up Jayson Tatum's miss to tie the game at 109-109 late in regulation, stood up Dario Saric on a critical defensive possession, and fittingly stole the ball on Philly's final desperation play at the buzzer.

             Baynes shot a combined 7-of-16 from deep vs. Philly in the semifinals, which is more 3-pointers than he'd made in his previous 409 career games. His ability to hit from the corners gave Boston critical scoring while forcing Joel Embiid further out of the paint, and he was just as impressive defensively tonight, including standing up Embiid to preserve a lead with 10 seconds left in the fourth quarter. The Cavaliers skew toward small-ball lineups, however, and it will be very interesting to see how coach Brad Stevens deploys Baynes in the Conference finals.

             Morris added one steal and one block while battling foul trouble through 25 minutes of action, and his shooting woes continue to plague him in the postseason. He came in shooting below 35.0% in the Conference semi-finals, well below his 42.9% mark for the regular season, and Boston has to be happy that they're advancing to play the Cavs despite Morris' ongoing struggles. They'll likely need him to regain his regular-season form to earn a trip to the Finals, though.

             The Celtics tweaked their lineup with Philly starting T.J. McConnell, J.J. Redick and Ben Simmons together -- Brown gave them more size to counter Simmons, while Marcus Smart shifted to the backup PG role with Shane Larkin (shoulder) unavailable. Brown was reportedly on a minute-limit due to his recent hamstring injury, but didn't appear limited while getting extra run tonight -- he'd averaged 25.7 minutes in Games 2-4. He'll get a few extra days to rest before squaring off with LeBron James and the Cavs in the Conference finals.

             Tatum came in with an impressive True Shooting percentage of 62.5% in this series, and he finished this series-clinching victory 8-of-15 from the field and 9-of-11 from the line. He made multiple clutch plays down the stretch and Boston's fans once again chanted ""He's a rookie"" when Tatum was at the FT line, because it's easy to forget when you watch him play. His left hand was wrapped after halftime, apparently due to a thumb injury, but it didn't appear to bother him. We'll add him to the injury report as a simple precaution, but he should be fine for Game 1 vs. the Cavs.

             The 29-year-old Koufos is entering his fourth year with Sacramento, having averaged 6.7 points and 6.6 rebounds in 19.6 minutes per game last season. He was unlikely to command a higher annual salary as a free agent, and is likely betting that he can lock up one more long-term deal in 2019. No matter where he's playing, he'll go undrafted in all but the deepest fantasy leagues.

             Sixers coach Brett Brown said before the game that he wanted Covington to shoot more 3-pointers early in the shot clock, but he didn't make his lone triple until the fourth quarter. He shot a brutal 32.1% from the field in the postseason, including 26.8% vs. Boston, but the Sixers have already committed to him long-term -- Covington and Joel Embiid are the only players with guaranteed salaries through 2021-22.

             McConnell got stuck defending Jayson Tatum repeatedly in the first half and Boston's rising star took full advantage, but otherwise Philly's 26-year-old guard was unimpeachable. He committed just one turnover in 38 minutes and helped limit Terry Rozier to 17 points on 4-of-15 shooting, finishing his postseason on a high note. It's a foregone conclusion that Philly will pick up their $1.6 million team option to retain McConnell for 2018-19.

             Simmons had three dunks and a layup in Game 4, making all of his field goals in the restricted area, and he followed a similar script tonight -- he shot 8-of-15 from the field with all of his makes in the paint. Necessity may have forced coach Brett Brown to start T.J. McConnell for Games 4 and 5 in this series, but we're expecting Simmons to resume his full-time PG role again next season. After all, the Rookie of the Year candidate notched historic averages with 15.8 points, 8.2 assists, 8.1 rebounds, 1.7 steals and 0.9 blocks while helping Philly earn the No. 3 seed this year.

            J.J. Redick had 14 points on 5-of-13 shooting, two 3-pointers, three assists and two rebounds in 38 minutes during Philly's season-ending loss on Wednesday.
        
        
             The Celtics swarmed Redick at the 3-point line all night long -- he didn't attempt a triple until 24 seconds remained in the first half, and his first make came against a double-team late in the third quarter. He sank a clutch 3-pointer to keep Philly in the game at the bitter end but it was too little, too late. Having signed a lucrative one-year deal with Philly last summer, the 33-year-old sharpshooter is headed back into unrestricted free agency.

            Dario Saric went off for 27 points, 10 rebounds, four assists and three 3-pointers during Philly's 114-112 loss in Boston on Wednesday, going 8-of-14 from the field in 40 minutes.
        
        
             Saric added a steal and a block and his stellar play nearly helped Philly force Game 6 before succumbing down the stretch. He hauled in four offensive boards, took advantage of mismatches vs. smaller players, and had a few beautiful passes to set up teammates in the paint. The Sixers' willingness to play Ben Simmons as a full-time PG was a blessing for Saric's fantasy value this season, and we're expecting similar top-75 value in 2018-19.

             Embiid was fired up after getting called for a technical foul and being heckled by the Celtics' home crowd, and his third-quarter eruption helped Philly close to within a point heading into the fourth. He was stonewalled and lost possession on a crucial possession late tonight, but the Sixers did themselves no favors by committing five team fouls just two minutes into the fourth quarter. Philly can still take solace in having advanced to the Conference semifinals with a young core that's only getting better.

            Marcus Smart came off the bench for 14 points, six rebounds, six assists and three steals in 33 minutes during Wednesday's series-clinching Game 5 home win.
        
        
             As usual, Smart's frenetic defense and energy were crucial to Boston's success. He bullied the Sixers' guards in the post and attempted seven free throws in the first half alone, finishing 8-of-13 from the stripe. He followed up Jayson Tatum's miss to tie the game at 109-109 late in regulation, stood up Dario Saric on a critical defensive possession, and fittingly stole the ball on Philly's final desperation play at the buzzer.

             Baynes shot a combined 7-of-16 from deep vs. Philly in the semifinals, which is more 3-pointers than he'd made in his previous 409 career games. His ability to hit from the corners gave Boston critical scoring while forcing Joel Embiid further out of the paint, and he was just as impressive defensively tonight, including standing up Embiid to preserve a lead with 10 seconds left in the fourth quarter. The Cavaliers skew toward small-ball lineups, however, and it will be very interesting to see how coach Brad Stevens deploys Baynes in the Conference finals.

             Morris added one steal and one block while battling foul trouble through 25 minutes of action, and his shooting woes continue to plague him in the postseason. He came in shooting below 35.0% in the Conference semi-finals, well below his 42.9% mark for the regular season, and Boston has to be happy that they're advancing to play the Cavs despite Morris' ongoing struggles. They'll likely need him to regain his regular-season form to earn a trip to the Finals, though.

             The Celtics tweaked their lineup with Philly starting T.J. McConnell, J.J. Redick and Ben Simmons together -- Brown gave them more size to counter Simmons, while Marcus Smart shifted to the backup PG role with Shane Larkin (shoulder) unavailable. Brown was reportedly on a minute-limit due to his recent hamstring injury, but didn't appear limited while getting extra run tonight -- he'd averaged 25.7 minutes in Games 2-4. He'll get a few extra days to rest before squaring off with LeBron James and the Cavs in the Conference finals.

             Tatum came in with an impressive True Shooting percentage of 62.5% in this series, and he finished this series-clinching victory 8-of-15 from the field and 9-of-11 from the line. He made multiple clutch plays down the stretch and Boston's fans once again chanted ""He's a rookie"" when Tatum was at the FT line, because it's easy to forget when you watch him play. His left hand was wrapped after halftime, apparently due to a thumb injury, but it didn't appear to bother him. We'll add him to the injury report as a simple precaution, but he should be fine for Game 1 vs. the Cavs.

He was unlikely to command a higher annual salary as a free agent, and is likely betting that he can lock up one more long-term deal in 2019. No matter where he's playing, he'll go undrafted in all but the deepest fantasy leagues.

             McConnell got stuck defending Jayson Tatum repeatedly in the first half and Boston's rising star took full advantage, but otherwise Philly's 26-year-old guard was unimpeachable. He committed just one turnover in 38 minutes and helped limit Terry Rozier to 17 points on 4-of-15 shooting, finishing his postseason on a high note.

            The Sixers' season ended on Wednesday despite Ben Simmons contributing 18 points, eight rebounds, six assists and one block in 34 minutes.
        
        
             Simmons had three dunks and a layup in Game 4, making all of his field goals in the restricted area, and he followed a similar script tonight -- he shot 8-of-15 from the field with all of his makes in the paint. Necessity may have forced coach Brett Brown to start T.J. McConnell for Games 4 and 5 in this series, but we're expecting Simmons to resume his full-time PG role again next season. After all, the Rookie of the Year candidate notched historic averages with 15.8 points, 8.2 assists, 8.1 rebounds, 1.7 steals and 0.9 blocks while helping Philly earn the No. 3 seed this year. Not too shabby.

            J.J. Redick had 14 points on 5-of-13 shooting, two 3-pointers, three assists and two rebounds in 38 minutes during Philly's season-ending loss on Wednesday.
        
        
             The Celtics swarmed Redick at the 3-point line all night long -- he didn't attempt a triple until 24 seconds remained in the first half, and his first make came against a double-team late in the third quarter. He sank a clutch 3-pointer to keep Philly in the game at the bitter end but it was too little, too late. Having signed a lucrative one-year deal with Philly last summer, the 33-year-old sharpshooter is headed back into unrestricted free agency.

            Dario Saric went off for 27 points, 10 rebounds, four assists and three 3-pointers during Philly's 114-112 loss in Boston on Wednesday, going 8-of-14 from the field in 40 minutes.
        
        
             Saric added a steal and a block and his stellar play nearly helped Philly force Game 6 before succumbing down the stretch. He hauled in four offensive boards, took advantage of mismatches vs. smaller players, and had a few beautiful passes to set up teammates in the paint. The Sixers' willingness to play Ben Simmons as a full-time PG was a blessing for Saric's fantasy value this season, and we're expecting similar top-75 value in 2018-19.

             Embiid was fired up after getting called for a technical foul and being heckled by the Celtics' home crowd, and his third-quarter eruption helped Philly close to within a point heading into the fourth. He was stonewalled and lost possession on a crucial possession late tonight, but the Sixers did themselves no favors by committing five team fouls just two minutes into the fourth quarter. Philly can still take solace in having advanced to the Conference semifinals with a young core that's only getting better.

             As usual, Smart's frenetic defense and energy were crucial to Boston's success. He bullied the Sixers' guards in the post and attempted seven free throws in the first half alone, finishing 8-of-13 from the stripe. He followed up Jayson Tatum's miss to tie the game at 109-109 late in regulation, stood up Dario Saric on a critical defensive possession, and fittingly stole the ball on Philly's final desperation play at the buzzer.

             Baynes shot a combined 7-of-16 from deep vs. Philly in the semifinals, which is more 3-pointers than he'd made in his previous 409 career games. His ability to hit from the corners gave Boston critical scoring while forcing Joel Embiid further out of the paint, and he was just as impressive defensively tonight, including standing up Embiid to preserve a lead with 10 seconds left in the fourth quarter. The Cavaliers skew toward small-ball lineups, however, and it will be very interesting to see how coach Brad Stevens deploys Baynes in the Conference finals.

             Morris added one steal and one block while battling foul trouble through 25 minutes of action, and his shooting woes continue to plague him in the postseason. He came in shooting below 35.0% in the Conference semi-finals, well below his 42.9% mark for the regular season, and Boston has to be happy that they're advancing to play the Cavs despite Morris' ongoing struggles. They'll likely need him to regain his regular-season form to earn a trip to the Finals, though.

             The Celtics tweaked their lineup with Philly starting T.J. McConnell, J.J. Redick and Ben Simmons together -- Brown gave them more size to counter Simmons, while Marcus Smart shifted to the backup PG role with Shane Larkin (shoulder) unavailable. Brown was reportedly on a minute-limit due to his recent hamstring injury, but didn't appear limited while getting extra run tonight -- he'd averaged 25.7 minutes in Games 2-4. He'll get a few extra days to rest before squaring off with LeBron James and the Cavs in the Conference finals.

             Tatum came in with an impressive True Shooting percentage of 62.5% in this series, and he finished this series-clinching victory 8-of-15 from the field and 9-of-11 from the line. He made multiple clutch plays down the stretch and Boston's fans once again chanted ""He's a rookie"" when Tatum was at the FT line, because it's easy to forget when you watch him play. His left hand was wrapped after halftime, apparently due to a thumb injury, but it didn't appear to bother him. We'll add him to the injury report as a simple precaution, but he should be fine for Game 1 vs. the Cavs.

He was unlikely to command a higher annual salary as a free agent, and is likely betting that he can lock up one more long-term deal in 2019. No matter where he's playing, he'll go undrafted in all but the deepest fantasy leagues.

He shot a brutal 32.1% from the field in the postseason, including 26.8% vs. Boston, but the Sixers have already committed to him long-term -- Covington and Joel Embiid are the only players with guaranteed salaries through 2021-22.

            T.J. McConnell earned another start during Philly's Game 5 defeat on Wednesday, scoring nine points on 4-of-7 shooting with six assists, five rebounds and two steals.
        
        
             McConnell got stuck defending Jayson Tatum repeatedly in the first half and Boston's rising star took full advantage, but otherwise Philly's 26-year-old guard was unimpeachable. He committed just one turnover in 38 minutes and helped limit Terry Rozier to 17 points on 4-of-15 shooting, finishing his postseason on a high note. It's a foregone conclusion that Philly will pick up their $1.6 million team option to retain McConnell for 2018-19.

            The Sixers' season ended on Wednesday despite Ben Simmons contributing 18 points, eight rebounds, six assists and one block in 34 minutes.
        
        
             Simmons had three dunks and a layup in Game 4, making all of his field goals in the restricted area, and he followed a similar script tonight -- he shot 8-of-15 from the field with all of his makes in the paint. Necessity may have forced coach Brett Brown to start T.J. McConnell for Games 4 and 5 in this series, but we're expecting Simmons to resume his full-time PG role again next season. After all, the Rookie of the Year candidate notched historic averages with 15.8 points, 8.2 assists, 8.1 rebounds, 1.7 steals and 0.9 blocks while helping Philly earn the No. 3 seed this year. Not too shabby.

            J.J. Redick had 14 points on 5-of-13 shooting, two 3-pointers, three assists and two rebounds in 38 minutes during Philly's season-ending loss on Wednesday.
        
        
             The Celtics swarmed Redick at the 3-point line all night long -- he didn't attempt a triple until 24 seconds remained in the first half, and his first make came against a double-team late in the third quarter. He sank a clutch 3-pointer to keep Philly in the game at the bitter end but it was too little, too late. Having signed a lucrative one-year deal with Philly last summer, the 33-year-old sharpshooter is headed back into unrestricted free agency.

             Saric added a steal and a block and his stellar play nearly helped Philly force Game 6 before succumbing down the stretch. He hauled in four offensive boards, took advantage of mismatches vs. smaller players, and had a few beautiful passes to set up teammates in the paint. The Sixers' willingness to play Ben Simmons as a full-time PG was a blessing for Saric's fantasy value this season, and we're expecting similar top-75 value in 2018-19.

             Embiid was fired up after getting called for a technical foul and being heckled by the Celtics' home crowd, and his third-quarter eruption helped Philly close to within a point heading into the fourth. He was stonewalled and lost possession on a crucial possession late tonight, but the Sixers did themselves no favors by committing five team fouls just two minutes into the fourth quarter. Philly can still take solace in having advanced to the Conference semifinals with a young core that's only getting better.

             As usual, Smart's frenetic defense and energy were crucial to Boston's success. He bullied the Sixers' guards in the post and attempted seven free throws in the first half alone, finishing 8-of-13 from the stripe. He followed up Jayson Tatum's miss to tie the game at 109-109 late in regulation, stood up Dario Saric on a critical defensive possession, and fittingly stole the ball on Philly's final desperation play at the buzzer.

             Baynes shot a combined 7-of-16 from deep vs. Philly in the semifinals, which is more 3-pointers than he'd made in his previous 409 career games. His ability to hit from the corners gave Boston critical scoring while forcing Joel Embiid further out of the paint, and he was just as impressive defensively tonight, including standing up Embiid to preserve a lead with 10 seconds left in the fourth quarter. The Cavaliers skew toward small-ball lineups, however, and it will be very interesting to see how coach Brad Stevens deploys Baynes in the Conference finals.

             Morris added one steal and one block while battling foul trouble through 25 minutes of action, and his shooting woes continue to plague him in the postseason. He came in shooting below 35.0% in the Conference semi-finals, well below his 42.9% mark for the regular season, and Boston has to be happy that they're advancing to play the Cavs despite Morris' ongoing struggles. They'll likely need him to regain his regular-season form to earn a trip to the Finals, though.

             The Celtics tweaked their lineup with Philly starting T.J. McConnell, J.J. Redick and Ben Simmons together -- Brown gave them more size to counter Simmons, while Marcus Smart shifted to the backup PG role with Shane Larkin (shoulder) unavailable. Brown was reportedly on a minute-limit due to his recent hamstring injury, but didn't appear limited while getting extra run tonight -- he'd averaged 25.7 minutes in Games 2-4. He'll get a few extra days to rest before squaring off with LeBron James and the Cavs in the Conference finals.

             Tatum came in with an impressive True Shooting percentage of 62.5% in this series, and he finished this series-clinching victory 8-of-15 from the field and 9-of-11 from the line. He made multiple clutch plays down the stretch and Boston's fans once again chanted ""He's a rookie"" when Tatum was at the FT line, because it's easy to forget when you watch him play. His left hand was wrapped after halftime, apparently due to a thumb injury, but it didn't appear to bother him. We'll add him to the injury report as a simple precaution, but he should be fine for Game 1 vs. the Cavs.

He was unlikely to command a higher annual salary as a free agent, and is likely betting that he can lock up one more long-term deal in 2019. No matter where he's playing, he'll go undrafted in all but the deepest fantasy leagues.

            Shane Larkin (sprained left shoulder) said that an MRI ""showed some problems"" and his status for the Eastern Conference Finals is uncertain.
        
        
             Larkin said he'll try to play vs. Cleveland but he ""didn't sound optimistic,"" according to beat writer Gary Washburn. The Celtics don't think he'll need surgery but coach Brad Stevens said Larkin is out for the ""foreseeable future,"" and it sounds like they'll rely on Terry Rozier and Marcus Smart for PG minutes throughout the next round.

             Sixers coach Brett Brown said before the game that he wanted Covington to shoot more 3-pointers early in the shot clock, but he didn't make his lone triple until the fourth quarter. He shot a brutal 32.1% from the field in the postseason, including 26.8% vs. Boston, but the Sixers have already committed to him long-term -- Covington and Joel Embiid are the only players with guaranteed salaries through 2021-22.

             McConnell got stuck defending Jayson Tatum repeatedly in the first half and Boston's rising star took full advantage, but otherwise Philly's 26-year-old guard was unimpeachable. He committed just one turnover in 38 minutes and helped limit Terry Rozier to 17 points on 4-of-15 shooting, finishing his postseason on a high note. It's a foregone conclusion that Philly will pick up their $1.6 million team option to retain McConnell for 2018-19.

            The Sixers' season ended on Wednesday despite Ben Simmons contributing 18 points, eight rebounds, six assists and one block in 34 minutes.
        
        
             Simmons had three dunks and a layup in Game 4, making all of his field goals in the restricted area, and he followed a similar script tonight -- he shot 8-of-15 from the field with all of his makes in the paint. Necessity may have forced coach Brett Brown to start T.J. McConnell for Games 4 and 5 in this series, but we're expecting Simmons to resume his full-time PG role again next season. After all, the Rookie of the Year candidate notched historic averages with 15.8 points, 8.2 assists, 8.1 rebounds, 1.7 steals and 0.9 blocks while helping Philly earn the No. 3 seed this year. Not too shabby.

            J.J. Redick had 14 points on 5-of-13 shooting, two 3-pointers, three assists and two rebounds in 38 minutes during Philly's season-ending loss on Wednesday.
        
        
             The Celtics swarmed Redick at the 3-point line all night long -- he didn't attempt a triple until 24 seconds remained in the first half, and his first make came against a double-team late in the third quarter. He sank a clutch 3-pointer to keep Philly in the game at the bitter end but it was too little, too late. Having signed a lucrative one-year deal with Philly last summer, the 33-year-old sharpshooter is headed back into unrestricted free agency.

             Saric added a steal and a block and his stellar play nearly helped Philly force Game 6 before succumbing down the stretch. He hauled in four offensive boards, took advantage of mismatches vs. smaller players, and had a few beautiful passes to set up teammates in the paint. The Sixers' willingness to play Ben Simmons as a full-time PG was a blessing for Saric's fantasy value this season, and we're expecting similar top-75 value in 2018-19.

             Embiid was fired up after getting called for a technical foul and being heckled by the Celtics' home crowd, and his third-quarter eruption helped Philly close to within a point heading into the fourth. He was stonewalled and lost possession on a crucial possession late tonight, but the Sixers did themselves no favors by committing five team fouls just two minutes into the fourth quarter. Philly can still take solace in having advanced to the Conference semifinals with a young core that's only getting better.

             As usual, Smart's frenetic defense and energy were crucial to Boston's success. He bullied the Sixers' guards in the post and attempted seven free throws in the first half alone, finishing 8-of-13 from the stripe. He followed up Jayson Tatum's miss to tie the game at 109-109 late in regulation, stood up Dario Saric on a critical defensive possession, and fittingly stole the ball on Philly's final desperation play at the buzzer.

             Baynes shot a combined 7-of-16 from deep vs. Philly in the semifinals, which is more 3-pointers than he'd made in his previous 409 career games. His ability to hit from the corners gave Boston critical scoring while forcing Joel Embiid further out of the paint, and he was just as impressive defensively tonight, including standing up Embiid to preserve a lead with 10 seconds left in the fourth quarter. The Cavaliers skew toward small-ball lineups, however, and it will be very interesting to see how coach Brad Stevens deploys Baynes in the Conference finals.

             Morris added one steal and one block while battling foul trouble through 25 minutes of action, and his shooting woes continue to plague him in the postseason. He came in shooting below 35.0% in the Conference semi-finals, well below his 42.9% mark for the regular season, and Boston has to be happy that they're advancing to play the Cavs despite Morris' ongoing struggles. They'll likely need him to regain his regular-season form to earn a trip to the Finals, though.

             The Celtics tweaked their lineup with Philly starting T.J. McConnell, J.J. Redick and Ben Simmons together -- Brown gave them more size to counter Simmons, while Marcus Smart shifted to the backup PG role with Shane Larkin (shoulder) unavailable. Brown was reportedly on a minute-limit due to his recent hamstring injury, but didn't appear limited while getting extra run tonight -- he'd averaged 25.7 minutes in Games 2-4. He'll get a few extra days to rest before squaring off with LeBron James and the Cavs in the Conference finals.

             Tatum came in with an impressive True Shooting percentage of 62.5% in this series, and he finished this series-clinching victory 8-of-15 from the field and 9-of-11 from the line. He made multiple clutch plays down the stretch and Boston's fans once again chanted ""He's a rookie"" when Tatum was at the FT line, because it's easy to forget when you watch him play. His left hand was wrapped after halftime, apparently due to a thumb injury, but it didn't appear to bother him. We'll add him to the injury report as a simple precaution, but he should be fine for Game 1 vs. the Cavs.

            Kosta Koufos will exercise his $8.7 million player option to remain with the Kings for the 2018-19 season.
        
        
             The 29-year-old Koufos is entering his fourth year with Sacramento, having averaged 6.7 points and 6.6 rebounds in 19.6 minutes per game last season. He was unlikely to command a higher annual salary as a free agent, and is likely betting that he can lock up one more long-term deal in 2019. No matter where he's playing, he'll go undrafted in all but the deepest fantasy leagues.

             Larkin said he'll try to play vs. Cleveland but he ""didn't sound optimistic,"" according to beat writer Gary Washburn. The Celtics don't think he'll need surgery but coach Brad Stevens said Larkin is out for the ""foreseeable future,"" and it sounds like they'll rely on Terry Rozier and Marcus Smart for PG minutes throughout the next round.

             Sixers coach Brett Brown said before the game that he wanted Covington to shoot more 3-pointers early in the shot clock, but he didn't make his lone triple until the fourth quarter. He shot a brutal 32.1% from the field in the postseason, including 26.8% vs. Boston, but the Sixers have already committed to him long-term -- Covington and Joel Embiid are the only players with guaranteed salaries through 2021-22.

             McConnell got stuck defending Jayson Tatum repeatedly in the first half and Boston's rising star took full advantage, but otherwise Philly's 26-year-old guard was unimpeachable. He committed just one turnover in 38 minutes and helped limit Terry Rozier to 17 points on 4-of-15 shooting, finishing his postseason on a high note. It's a foregone conclusion that Philly will pick up their $1.6 million team option to retain McConnell for 2018-19.

            The Sixers' season ended on Wednesday despite Ben Simmons contributing 18 points, eight rebounds, six assists and one block in 34 minutes.
        
        
             Simmons had three dunks and a layup in Game 4, making all of his field goals in the restricted area, and he followed a similar script tonight -- he shot 8-of-15 from the field with all of his makes in the paint. Necessity may have forced coach Brett Brown to start T.J. McConnell for Games 4 and 5 in this series, but we're expecting Simmons to resume his full-time PG role again next season. After all, the Rookie of the Year candidate notched historic averages with 15.8 points, 8.2 assists, 8.1 rebounds, 1.7 steals and 0.9 blocks while helping Philly earn the No. 3 seed this year. Not too shabby.

             The Celtics swarmed Redick at the 3-point line all night long -- he didn't attempt a triple until 24 seconds remained in the first half, and his first make came against a double-team late in the third quarter. He sank a clutch 3-pointer to keep Philly in the game at the bitter end but it was too little, too late. Having signed a lucrative one-year deal with Philly last summer, the 33-year-old sharpshooter is headed back into unrestricted free agency.

             Saric added a steal and a block and his stellar play nearly helped Philly force Game 6 before succumbing down the stretch. He hauled in four offensive boards, took advantage of mismatches vs. smaller players, and had a few beautiful passes to set up teammates in the paint. The Sixers' willingness to play Ben Simmons as a full-time PG was a blessing for Saric's fantasy value this season, and we're expecting similar top-75 value in 2018-19.

             Embiid was fired up after getting called for a technical foul and being heckled by the Celtics' home crowd, and his third-quarter eruption helped Philly close to within a point heading into the fourth. He was stonewalled and lost possession on a crucial possession late tonight, but the Sixers did themselves no favors by committing five team fouls just two minutes into the fourth quarter. Philly can still take solace in having advanced to the Conference semifinals with a young core that's only getting better.

             As usual, Smart's frenetic defense and energy were crucial to Boston's success. He bullied the Sixers' guards in the post and attempted seven free throws in the first half alone, finishing 8-of-13 from the stripe. He followed up Jayson Tatum's miss to tie the game at 109-109 late in regulation, stood up Dario Saric on a critical defensive possession, and fittingly stole the ball on Philly's final desperation play at the buzzer.

             Baynes shot a combined 7-of-16 from deep vs. Philly in the semifinals, which is more 3-pointers than he'd made in his previous 409 career games. His ability to hit from the corners gave Boston critical scoring while forcing Joel Embiid further out of the paint, and he was just as impressive defensively tonight, including standing up Embiid to preserve a lead with 10 seconds left in the fourth quarter. The Cavaliers skew toward small-ball lineups, however, and it will be very interesting to see how coach Brad Stevens deploys Baynes in the Conference finals.

             Morris added one steal and one block while battling foul trouble through 25 minutes of action, and his shooting woes continue to plague him in the postseason. He came in shooting below 35.0% in the Conference semi-finals, well below his 42.9% mark for the regular season, and Boston has to be happy that they're advancing to play the Cavs despite Morris' ongoing struggles. They'll likely need him to regain his regular-season form to earn a trip to the Finals, though.

             The Celtics tweaked their lineup with Philly starting T.J. McConnell, J.J. Redick and Ben Simmons together -- Brown gave them more size to counter Simmons, while Marcus Smart shifted to the backup PG role with Shane Larkin (shoulder) unavailable. Brown was reportedly on a minute-limit due to his recent hamstring injury, but didn't appear limited while getting extra run tonight -- he'd averaged 25.7 minutes in Games 2-4. He'll get a few extra days to rest before squaring off with LeBron James and the Cavs in the Conference finals.

He made multiple clutch plays down the stretch and Boston's fans once again chanted ""He's a rookie"" when Tatum was at the FT line, because it's easy to forget when you watch him play. His left hand was wrapped after halftime, apparently due to a thumb injury, but it didn't appear to bother him. We'll add him to the injury report as a simple precaution, but he should be fine for Game 1 vs. the Cavs.

            Paul George had arthroscopic surgery on his left knee on Wednesday and he's expected to resume basketball activities in 6-8 weeks.
        
        
             PG battled left knee soreness in late December but he only missed one game, after which we heard nothing about the knee. Fortunately, the initial timetable gives him plenty of time to prepare for training camp -- the big question is which team he'll be playing for, as he's expected to decline his $20.7 million player option in favor of free agency.

             The 29-year-old Koufos is entering his fourth year with Sacramento, having averaged 6.7 points and 6.6 rebounds in 19.6 minutes per game last season. He was unlikely to command a higher annual salary as a free agent, and is likely betting that he can lock up one more long-term deal in 2019. No matter where he's playing, he'll go undrafted in all but the deepest fantasy leagues.

             Sixers coach Brett Brown said before the game that he wanted Covington to shoot more 3-pointers early in the shot clock, but he didn't make his lone triple until the fourth quarter. He shot a brutal 32.1% from the field in the postseason, including 26.8% vs. Boston, but the Sixers have already committed to him long-term -- Covington and Joel Embiid are the only players with guaranteed salaries through 2021-22.

             McConnell got stuck defending Jayson Tatum repeatedly in the first half and Boston's rising star took full advantage, but otherwise Philly's 26-year-old guard was unimpeachable. He committed just one turnover in 38 minutes and helped limit Terry Rozier to 17 points on 4-of-15 shooting, finishing his postseason on a high note. It's a foregone conclusion that Philly will pick up their $1.6 million team option to retain McConnell for 2018-19.

             Simmons had three dunks and a layup in Game 4, making all of his field goals in the restricted area, and he followed a similar script tonight -- he shot 8-of-15 from the field with all of his makes in the paint. Necessity may have forced coach Brett Brown to start T.J. McConnell for Games 4 and 5 in this series, but we're expecting Simmons to resume his full-time PG role again next season. After all, the Rookie of the Year candidate notched historic averages with 15.8 points, 8.2 assists, 8.1 rebounds, 1.7 steals and 0.9 blocks while helping Philly earn the No. 3 seed this year. Not too shabby.

             The Celtics swarmed Redick at the 3-point line all night long -- he didn't attempt a triple until 24 seconds remained in the first half, and his first make came against a double-team late in the third quarter. He sank a clutch 3-pointer to keep Philly in the game at the bitter end but it was too little, too late. Having signed a lucrative one-year deal with Philly last summer, the 33-year-old sharpshooter is headed back into unrestricted free agency.

             Saric added a steal and a block and his stellar play nearly helped Philly force Game 6 before succumbing down the stretch. He hauled in four offensive boards, took advantage of mismatches vs. smaller players, and had a few beautiful passes to set up teammates in the paint. The Sixers' willingness to play Ben Simmons as a full-time PG was a blessing for Saric's fantasy value this season, and we're expecting similar top-75 value in 2018-19.

             Embiid was fired up after getting called for a technical foul and being heckled by the Celtics' home crowd, and his third-quarter eruption helped Philly close to within a point heading into the fourth. He was stonewalled and lost possession on a crucial possession late tonight, but the Sixers did themselves no favors by committing five team fouls just two minutes into the fourth quarter. Philly can still take solace in having advanced to the Conference semifinals with a young core that's only getting better.

             As usual, Smart's frenetic defense and energy were crucial to Boston's success. He bullied the Sixers' guards in the post and attempted seven free throws in the first half alone, finishing 8-of-13 from the stripe. He followed up Jayson Tatum's miss to tie the game at 109-109 late in regulation, stood up Dario Saric on a critical defensive possession, and fittingly stole the ball on Philly's final desperation play at the buzzer.

             Baynes shot a combined 7-of-16 from deep vs. Philly in the semifinals, which is more 3-pointers than he'd made in his previous 409 career games. His ability to hit from the corners gave Boston critical scoring while forcing Joel Embiid further out of the paint, and he was just as impressive defensively tonight, including standing up Embiid to preserve a lead with 10 seconds left in the fourth quarter. The Cavaliers skew toward small-ball lineups, however, and it will be very interesting to see how coach Brad Stevens deploys Baynes in the Conference finals.

             Morris added one steal and one block while battling foul trouble through 25 minutes of action, and his shooting woes continue to plague him in the postseason. He came in shooting below 35.0% in the Conference semi-finals, well below his 42.9% mark for the regular season, and Boston has to be happy that they're advancing to play the Cavs despite Morris' ongoing struggles. They'll likely need him to regain his regular-season form to earn a trip to the Finals, though.

             The Celtics tweaked their lineup with Philly starting T.J. McConnell, J.J. Redick and Ben Simmons together -- Brown gave them more size to counter Simmons, while Marcus Smart shifted to the backup PG role with Shane Larkin (shoulder) unavailable. Brown was reportedly on a minute-limit due to his recent hamstring injury, but didn't appear limited while getting extra run tonight -- he'd averaged 25.7 minutes in Games 2-4. He'll get a few extra days to rest before squaring off with LeBron James and the Cavs in the Conference finals.

He made multiple clutch plays down the stretch and Boston's fans once again chanted ""He's a rookie"" when Tatum was at the FT line, because it's easy to forget when you watch him play. His left hand was wrapped after halftime, apparently due to a thumb injury, but it didn't appear to bother him.

             Jaylen Brown is sliding into the starting lineup and it's a reaction to Philly starting T.J. McConnell alongside Ben Simmons in the backcourt. Brown remains on a minute-limit, though, so it shouldn't alter fantasy values very much.

             PG battled left knee soreness in late December but he only missed one game, after which we heard nothing about the knee. Fortunately, the initial timetable gives him plenty of time to prepare for training camp -- the big question is which team he'll be playing for, as he's expected to decline his $20.7 million player option in favor of free agency.

             The 29-year-old Koufos is entering his fourth year with Sacramento, having averaged 6.7 points and 6.6 rebounds in 19.6 minutes per game last season. He was unlikely to command a higher annual salary as a free agent, and is likely betting that he can lock up one more long-term deal in 2019. No matter where he's playing, he'll go undrafted in all but the deepest fantasy leagues.

             Sixers coach Brett Brown said before the game that he wanted Covington to shoot more 3-pointers early in the shot clock, but he didn't make his lone triple until the fourth quarter. He shot a brutal 32.1% from the field in the postseason, including 26.8% vs. Boston, but the Sixers have already committed to him long-term -- Covington and Joel Embiid are the only players with guaranteed salaries through 2021-22.

             McConnell got stuck defending Jayson Tatum repeatedly in the first half and Boston's rising star took full advantage, but otherwise Philly's 26-year-old guard was unimpeachable. He committed just one turnover in 38 minutes and helped limit Terry Rozier to 17 points on 4-of-15 shooting, finishing his postseason on a high note. It's a foregone conclusion that Philly will pick up their $1.6 million team option to retain McConnell for 2018-19.

             Simmons had three dunks and a layup in Game 4, making all of his field goals in the restricted area, and he followed a similar script tonight -- he shot 8-of-15 from the field with all of his makes in the paint. Necessity may have forced coach Brett Brown to start T.J. McConnell for Games 4 and 5 in this series, but we're expecting Simmons to resume his full-time PG role again next season. After all, the Rookie of the Year candidate notched historic averages with 15.8 points, 8.2 assists, 8.1 rebounds, 1.7 steals and 0.9 blocks while helping Philly earn the No. 3 seed this year. Not too shabby.

             The Celtics swarmed Redick at the 3-point line all night long -- he didn't attempt a triple until 24 seconds remained in the first half, and his first make came against a double-team late in the third quarter. He sank a clutch 3-pointer to keep Philly in the game at the bitter end but it was too little, too late. Having signed a lucrative one-year deal with Philly last summer, the 33-year-old sharpshooter is headed back into unrestricted free agency.

             Saric added a steal and a block and his stellar play nearly helped Philly force Game 6 before succumbing down the stretch. He hauled in four offensive boards, took advantage of mismatches vs. smaller players, and had a few beautiful passes to set up teammates in the paint. The Sixers' willingness to play Ben Simmons as a full-time PG was a blessing for Saric's fantasy value this season, and we're expecting similar top-75 value in 2018-19.

             Embiid was fired up after getting called for a technical foul and being heckled by the Celtics' home crowd, and his third-quarter eruption helped Philly close to within a point heading into the fourth. He was stonewalled and lost possession on a crucial possession late tonight, but the Sixers did themselves no favors by committing five team fouls just two minutes into the fourth quarter. Philly can still take solace in having advanced to the Conference semifinals with a young core that's only getting better.

             As usual, Smart's frenetic defense and energy were crucial to Boston's success. He bullied the Sixers' guards in the post and attempted seven free throws in the first half alone, finishing 8-of-13 from the stripe. He followed up Jayson Tatum's miss to tie the game at 109-109 late in regulation, stood up Dario Saric on a critical defensive possession, and fittingly stole the ball on Philly's final desperation play at the buzzer.

             Baynes shot a combined 7-of-16 from deep vs. Philly in the semifinals, which is more 3-pointers than he'd made in his previous 409 career games. His ability to hit from the corners gave Boston critical scoring while forcing Joel Embiid further out of the paint, and he was just as impressive defensively tonight, including standing up Embiid to preserve a lead with 10 seconds left in the fourth quarter. The Cavaliers skew toward small-ball lineups, however, and it will be very interesting to see how coach Brad Stevens deploys Baynes in the Conference finals.

             Morris added one steal and one block while battling foul trouble through 25 minutes of action, and his shooting woes continue to plague him in the postseason. He came in shooting below 35.0% in the Conference semi-finals, well below his 42.9% mark for the regular season, and Boston has to be happy that they're advancing to play the Cavs despite Morris' ongoing struggles. They'll likely need him to regain his regular-season form to earn a trip to the Finals, though.

             The Celtics tweaked their lineup with Philly starting T.J. McConnell, J.J.

Brown was reportedly on a minute-limit due to his recent hamstring injury, but didn't appear limited while getting extra run tonight -- he'd averaged 25.7 minutes in Games 2-4. He'll get a few extra days to rest before squaring off with LeBron James and the Cavs in the Conference finals.

            The Celtics advanced to the Eastern Conference Finals with a 114-112 win vs. Philly on Wednesday, led by Jayson Tatum's 25 points, four assists and three rebounds.
        
        
             Tatum came in with an impressive True Shooting percentage of 62.5% in this series, and he finished this series-clinching victory 8-of-15 from the field and 9-of-11 from the line. He made multiple clutch plays down the stretch and Boston's fans once again chanted ""He's a rookie"" when Tatum was at the FT line, because it's easy to forget when you watch him play. His left hand was wrapped after halftime, apparently due to a thumb injury, but it didn't appear to bother him. We'll add him to the injury report as a simple precaution, but he should be fine for Game 1 vs. the Cavs.

             PG battled left knee soreness in late December but he only missed one game, after which we heard nothing about the knee. Fortunately, the initial timetable gives him plenty of time to prepare for training camp -- the big question is which team he'll be playing for, as he's expected to decline his $20.7 million player option in favor of free agency.

             The 29-year-old Koufos is entering his fourth year with Sacramento, having averaged 6.7 points and 6.6 rebounds in 19.6 minutes per game last season. He was unlikely to command a higher annual salary as a free agent, and is likely betting that he can lock up one more long-term deal in 2019. No matter where he's playing, he'll go undrafted in all but the deepest fantasy leagues.

             Sixers coach Brett Brown said before the game that he wanted Covington to shoot more 3-pointers early in the shot clock, but he didn't make his lone triple until the fourth quarter. He shot a brutal 32.1% from the field in the postseason, including 26.8% vs. Boston, but the Sixers have already committed to him long-term -- Covington and Joel Embiid are the only players with guaranteed salaries through 2021-22.

             McConnell got stuck defending Jayson Tatum repeatedly in the first half and Boston's rising star took full advantage, but otherwise Philly's 26-year-old guard was unimpeachable. He committed just one turnover in 38 minutes and helped limit Terry Rozier to 17 points on 4-of-15 shooting, finishing his postseason on a high note. It's a foregone conclusion that Philly will pick up their $1.6 million team option to retain McConnell for 2018-19.

             Simmons had three dunks and a layup in Game 4, making all of his field goals in the restricted area, and he followed a similar script tonight -- he shot 8-of-15 from the field with all of his makes in the paint. Necessity may have forced coach Brett Brown to start T.J. McConnell for Games 4 and 5 in this series, but we're expecting Simmons to resume his full-time PG role again next season. After all, the Rookie of the Year candidate notched historic averages with 15.8 points, 8.2 assists, 8.1 rebounds, 1.7 steals and 0.9 blocks while helping Philly earn the No. 3 seed this year. Not too shabby.

             The Celtics swarmed Redick at the 3-point line all night long -- he didn't attempt a triple until 24 seconds remained in the first half, and his first make came against a double-team late in the third quarter. He sank a clutch 3-pointer to keep Philly in the game at the bitter end but it was too little, too late. Having signed a lucrative one-year deal with Philly last summer, the 33-year-old sharpshooter is headed back into unrestricted free agency.

             Saric added a steal and a block and his stellar play nearly helped Philly force Game 6 before succumbing down the stretch. He hauled in four offensive boards, took advantage of mismatches vs. smaller players, and had a few beautiful passes to set up teammates in the paint. The Sixers' willingness to play Ben Simmons as a full-time PG was a blessing for Saric's fantasy value this season, and we're expecting similar top-75 value in 2018-19.

             Embiid was fired up after getting called for a technical foul and being heckled by the Celtics' home crowd, and his third-quarter eruption helped Philly close to within a point heading into the fourth. He was stonewalled and lost possession on a crucial possession late tonight, but the Sixers did themselves no favors by committing five team fouls just two minutes into the fourth quarter. Philly can still take solace in having advanced to the Conference semifinals with a young core that's only getting better.

             As usual, Smart's frenetic defense and energy were crucial to Boston's success. He bullied the Sixers' guards in the post and attempted seven free throws in the first half alone, finishing 8-of-13 from the stripe. He followed up Jayson Tatum's miss to tie the game at 109-109 late in regulation, stood up Dario Saric on a critical defensive possession, and fittingly stole the ball on Philly's final desperation play at the buzzer.

             Baynes shot a combined 7-of-16 from deep vs. Philly in the semifinals, which is more 3-pointers than he'd made in his previous 409 career games. His ability to hit from the corners gave Boston critical scoring while forcing Joel Embiid further out of the paint, and he was just as impressive defensively tonight, including standing up Embiid to preserve a lead with 10 seconds left in the fourth quarter. The Cavaliers skew toward small-ball lineups, however, and it will be very interesting to see how coach Brad Stevens deploys Baynes in the Conference finals.

             Morris added one steal and one block while battling foul trouble through 25 minutes of action, and his shooting woes continue to plague him in the postseason. He came in shooting below 35.0% in the Conference semi-finals, well below his 42.9% mark for the regular season, and Boston has to be happy that they're advancing to play the Cavs despite Morris' ongoing struggles. They'll likely need him to regain his regular-season form to earn a trip to the Finals, though.

            Jaylen Brown was terrific as a starter on Wednesday, hitting 10-of-13 shots to score 24 points with three 3-pointers, four rebounds, two assists and two blocks in 31 minutes.
        
        
             The Celtics tweaked their lineup with Philly starting T.J. McConnell, J.J. Redick and Ben Simmons together -- Brown gave them more size to counter Simmons, while Marcus Smart shifted to the backup PG role with Shane Larkin (shoulder) unavailable. Brown was reportedly on a minute-limit due to his recent hamstring injury, but didn't appear limited while getting extra run tonight -- he'd averaged 25.7 minutes in Games 2-4. He'll get a few extra days to rest before squaring off with LeBron James and the Cavs in the Conference finals.

            The Celtics advanced to the Eastern Conference Finals with a 114-112 win vs. Philly on Wednesday, led by Jayson Tatum's 25 points, four assists and three rebounds.
        
        
             Tatum came in with an impressive True Shooting percentage of 62.5% in this series, and he finished this series-clinching victory 8-of-15 from the field and 9-of-11 from the line. He made multiple clutch plays down the stretch and Boston's fans once again chanted ""He's a rookie"" when Tatum was at the FT line, because it's easy to forget when you watch him play. His left hand was wrapped after halftime, apparently due to a thumb injury, but it didn't appear to bother him. We'll add him to the injury report as a simple precaution, but he should be fine for Game 1 vs. the Cavs.

             Jaylen Brown is sliding into the starting lineup and it's a reaction to Philly starting T.J. McConnell alongside Ben Simmons in the backcourt. Brown remains on a minute-limit, though, so it shouldn't alter fantasy values very much.

            Paul George had arthroscopic surgery on his left knee on Wednesday and he's expected to resume basketball activities in 6-8 weeks.
        
        
             PG battled left knee soreness in late December but he only missed one game, after which we heard nothing about the knee. Fortunately, the initial timetable gives him plenty of time to prepare for training camp -- the big question is which team he'll be playing for, as he's expected to decline his $20.7 million player option in favor of free agency.
