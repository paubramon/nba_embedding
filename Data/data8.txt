            DeMarre Carroll (ribs) scored nine points with four rebounds, one assist, one block and one 3-pointer in 31 minutes against the Wolves on Wednesday.
        
        
             He guarded Jimmy Butler on the last play and he was able to earn the stop in isolation to help the Nets earn their 15th win. Carroll did look to be in some discomfort after a dunk attempt in this game and maybe it was because of his rib injury, but he obviously stayed in the game. He's trended down after a strong start, but Carroll should still be owned in most 12-team formats.

             He did miss a shot at the end of the game with DeMarre Carroll defending him in isolation. Butler continues to rack up the scoring and again he got a lot of calls with a 16-of-18 shooting line from the charity stripe. Butler has been flirting with the No. 1 spot in nine-category leagues over his last nine games, averaging 28.9 points, 4.4 boards, 5.4 assists, 1.9 steals, 0.3 blocks and 1.0 treys on 52.3 percent from the field and 92.9 percent from the line. He looks like a first-round player going forward.

             After a brutal 2-of-13 mark in his previous two games, Kieff found a rhythm against New York's defense tonight. The playing time was also a season-high, which is a great sign that his conditioning is back after sports hernia surgery. He's been a liability in leagues with 14 or fewer teams, but has mid-round potential if he heats up -- for now, just keep an eye on him.

             Satoransky has quietly moved ahead of Tim Frazier (DNP-CD) for the Wizards' backup PG job. It doesn't have immediate implications, but John Wall's owners should keep it in mind in case he gets injured at some point.

             It was the Wizards' first game vs. New York this season, and Gortat's owners must be eager for their rematch on Feb. 14. This follows up three straight single-digit scoring performances, of course, so it's hard to get too excited -- let's see if he can duplicate the feat vs. Marc Gasol and the Grizzlies on Friday.

             Beal was coming off a well-deserved Player of the Week designation, the first of his career. He picked up right where he left off and is posting top-40 value in most formats over the past month, buoyed by a red-hot stretch in early December while John Wall was out. He's close to automatic for fantasy purposes.

             The four-time All-Star went 6-of-9 at the FT line, but he also connected on 9-of-18 field goals. That's just the second time he's made at least half of his shots since he returned from a knee injury on Dec. 13, and he did it by making all but two of his shots within the restricted area. Let's hope he stays in attack mode vs. the Grizzlies on Friday.

He should still have around 1-2 more weeks of value with Jeff Teague (knee) on the shelf.

             KOQ made 6-of-10 shots with two assists, one steal, one block and zero turnovers, and he was rewarded with more playing time than starting center Enes Kanter (18 minutes). O'Quinn rarely takes a shot he can't make and he went 65.2% from the field in December, which is a big part of his roto appeal. He's still just a fringe option while Kanter and Kristaps Porzingis are healthy.

             It's still unclear when Tim Hardaway Jr. (leg) might return, as he's yet to resume running, which leaves the Knicks' backcourt running on fumes. Lee's 13.4 points per game is the highest among New York's healthy guards, but he's shooting just 39.0% over the past 10 games. He's still worth owning as a solid source of 3-pointers, steals and FT%, in addition to decent points and assists.

             Kanter battled some foul trouble and got his fourth at the 6:32 mark of the third quarter, but he was also limited by the solid play of backup Kyle O'Quinn. He's played between 17-20 minutes in four straight games, which is a concerning trend, especially since the Knicks aren't yet giving Willy Hernangomez (two minutes) the time of day. Hopefully we'll see Kanter get more run vs. the size of Hassan Whiteside on Friday.

He's lived at the line over his last two games with 23 makes on 23 attempts while he's seen an upward trend since early December. Of course, the big headline is DeRozan making 25 treys over his last eight games, including 10 in his last two to start 2018. It's hard to buy this 3-point output, but DeRozan's work in the offseason could help him get to over 1.0 per game going forward.

            Delon Wright played the game of his life against the Bulls on Wednesday, scoring 25 points with 13 rebounds, five assists, four steals, four 3-pointers and one block in 30 minutes.
        
        
             That is a career-high in points, boards, and threes while also tying his best output in steals. Wright continues to get big minutes late and it helps that he can play three positions. In his last seven games, Wright averaged 12.1 points, 4.4 boards, 1.7 steals, 1.1 blocks, 1.3 treys and 2.3 assists on 52.3 percent from the field and 88.9 percent from the line. While that is a fairly small sample, Wright has been an early-round player over these seven games and he was starting to turn the corner before his shoulder injury in November. He's almost too hot to leave on the waiver wire in standard leagues and he has upside for his defensive stats output.

            Michael Beasley had another impressive effort on Wednesday, scoring 20 points with nine rebounds, three assists, two steals and two blocks in 25 minutes off the bench.
        
        
             Beasley has scored double-digit in four straight games, but what's more impressive is the supporting stats. During that span, he's added 8.8 rebounds, 2.5 assists, 1.3 steals, 1.3 blocks and 0.5 triples in just 26.0 minutes per game. We're very skeptical that he can keep up such a torrid pace, and it can't hurt to float some sell-high offers if you scooped him off the wire.

             Bakers will be playing in a mask for at least four weeks, he said, but the injury didn't prevent him from getting out there vs. the Wizards tonight. Even healthy, he's a non-entity in standard fantasy leagues with minutes typically in the teens.

             He doesn't look to have any tape on his neck and looks to be OK, and he hit a big three to basically ice the game. Moore is worth holding in 12-team leagues.

             Coach Fred Hoiberg is finding more ways to put his best players on the floor with plenty of combinations with Markkanen and Nikola Mirotic. Markkanen has played a grand total of 50 minutes next to Mirotic and he's actually lit it up in that time with an 86.6 TS% while still holding steady at a 19.7 usage rate -- it's 22.6 without Mirotic. Markkanen will have some slumps, but he looks like a strong hold the rest of the way.

             It's really just his second offensive dud in over a month with this one and a two-point line against the Celtics on Dec. 23. Delon Wright and the Raptors made him very uncomfortable, so chalk the bad game up to that and not his knee injury that kept him out of a game last week. Dunn should be better against the Mavs on Friday.

             Owners who grabbed Biyombo off the waiver wire should be satisfied his production since Nikola Vucevic (hand) went down, despite this dud. In Orlando's previous four games he was averaging 9.5 points, 13.0 rebounds and 3.3 blocks, with three double-doubles in that span. It will be interesting to see how coach Frank Vogel uses him vs. the small-ball Cavaliers this weekend.

             Payton made 5-of-9 FGs and 4-of-4 FTs, and it was nice to see him making his shots tonight -- there's been renewed controversy about his hair obscuring his vision, particularly on a close-range jumper vs. Brooklyn on Monday (see link below). Evan Fournier was also limited to 30 minutes, scoring 10 points with five rebounds and one assist, but both starters' minutes were simply limited by the score tonight.

             Gordon saw some minutes at center tonight and Orlando continues to find ways to play through him despite increased attention from opposing defenses.

             Jonathon Simmons didn't return after the half due to back spasms, which bumped Hezonja up in the rotation. Orlando scored only 12 points in the first quarter of tonight's lopsided defeat -- they scored more with Hezonja to start the third quarter, but also gave up 34 points. The Magic return to action Saturday against LeBron James and the Cavs, and if Simmons can't go Hezonja will be an interesting DFS and streaming option.

             His playing time has taken a noticeable hit because of Nikola Mirotic playing next to Lauri Markkanen more often these days. Portis has only been able to hang around late-round value over the last two weeks, so owners in 10-team leagues can probably do better. Maybe 12-team formats, too.

            Gerald Green came off the bench for a game-high 27 points in 28 minutes on Wednesday, making 9-of-15 shots with seven 3-pointers, six rebounds, two assists and one block.
        
        
             Impressive. Eric Gordon is starting while James Harden (strained hamstring) recovers, which leaves a big hole in the Rockets' second unit -- enter Gerald Green. The shoot-first swingman is averaging 18.3 points, 4.3 triples, 3.7 rebounds and 1.3 steals over the past three games, on combined 19-of-32 shooting. That efficiency is unsustainable, of course, but he has a green light on offense and is worth grabbing if you need scoring and perimeter shooting.

            Clint Capela scored an efficient 21 points during Wednesday's blowout win, going 8-of-12 from the field and 5-of-6 from the line in just 23 minutes.
        
        
             Playing alongside Chris Paul is a good look for Capela, and the two connected on a bunch of easy buckets at the rim tonight. The solid free-throw shooting is a bonus for Capela's owners, as he came in at 57.9% on the season -- even that mark is easily a career-high. Despite a few recent injuries (bruised left heel, right orbital fracture), Capela is back to posting top-50 fantasy value.

             Ariza was coming off a season-high 26 points on Sunday, and the absence of James Harden (hamstring) means more shots will be available for guys like Ariza, Ryan Anderson, Eric Gordon and Gerald Green. As Chris Paul said before the game, ""We will definitely have to adjust how we play, the man [Harden] averages 30 points a game."" Ariza was already a must-start player in season-long leagues, so just keep riding him.

             He's been playing through a rib injury, but it didn't seem to affect him or his playing time. He's been able to coexist with Lauri Markkanen, who has been fairly hot in his last four games. Mirotic should be owned in standard leagues. Although, he does lose points for his video with the Bulls social team saying he likes jelly and mayo sandwiches, and dunking Oreos in orange juice.

He shot just 3-of-13 from the field tonight, but should revert to form vs. the Warriors on Thursday.

             James Harden's hamstring injury has thrust Gordon into the starting lineup for what should be a minimum of two weeks. That's good news for fantasy owners, since Gordon's numbers as a starter are higher for points (22.4), threes (4.1), rebounds (2.6), assists (2.9) and steals (0.8). The scoring and 3-pointers are the bedrock of his value, of course, but he's also a great source of FT percentages (83.3% on 4.4 attempts).

            Dejounte Murray started vs. the Sixers on Wednesday but had only four points, one rebound and one block in 14 minutes.
        
        
             He burned anyone who streamed him tonight, and it was Patty Mills who benefited from the absence of Danny Green, Kawhi Leonard, Tony Parker and Manu Ginobili. Parker should be back in the starting lineup vs. Phoenix on Friday, so there's no reason to touch Murray.

            Coach Stan Van Gundy said Andre Drummond's (rib contusion) injury is about pain tolerance.
        
        
             SVG said no doctor said he couldn't play, so it sounds like everything is structurally sound. Drummond takes a lot of contact on the block, so his right side will get some contact more often than not when he is in the paint. It doesn't sound like he'll be out for too long, but adding Boban Marjanovic in deeper leagues makes sense until Drummond is active.

             Johnson was initially listed as the starting center, with Joel Embiid (hand) expected to sit out, but Embiid wound up starting and playing a team-high 35 minutes tonight. It was a forgettable night for all of Philly's backup big men -- Richaun Holmes chipped in two points in six minutes, and Trevor Booker added two points in eight minutes. Suffice to say, none of them are appealing while Embiid and Dario Saric are healthy.

            Kevin Love (right ankle) will not return against the Celtics on Wednesday.
        
        
             He went to the locker room at the end of the second quarter, but he did return to start the second half. Perhaps Love's ankle didn't hold up as well as he hoped, and it's important to note that the Celtics are up fairly big at the time of this announcement. Love did not have a good game with two points on 1-of-11 from the field in 21 minutes of action. The Cavs are off until Saturday, so consider Love questionable for that game in Orlando. If he's out, Jae Crowder, Jeff Green and maybe Tristan Thompson should benefit.

             It was Simmons' second-highest makes and attempts from the FT line, and he also went 8-of-18 from the field in a win vs. San Antonio. He's had a few rough scoring nights recently, hitting single-digits twice in the past four games, but he got back on track at home after a tiring five-game road trip.

             Embiid was listed as 'doubtful' all day and the Sixers initially announced Amir Johnson as the starting center, so this was a last-minute shocker. He certainly didn't look hurt, getting his four blocks in the first quarter, so hopefully the last-minute change didn't land him on the bench in too many leagues. All signs point to Embiid playing vs. Detroit on Friday, but as tonight proves it can't hurt to double-check his status.

            The Sixers snapped a 10-game losing streak to the Spurs on Wednesday, aided by J.J. Redick's 20 points, four assists, three 3-pointers and two rebounds.
        
        
             Redick hit 6-of-12 FGs and 5-of-6 FTs while committing just one turnover in 32 minutes. This is exactly the type of efficient scoring owners want to see from J.J., who is checking all the usual boxes. He'll never be a great source of supporting stats, but deserves credit for averaging a career-high 2.6 rebounds and 3.3 assists (second-highest in his 12-year career).

             That explains why Simmons didn't start the second half with Mario Hezonja taking his place. Hopefully this is more of a precaution and now Simmons is no longer on the bench. If he's going to miss time, it should be Hezonja, Arron Afflalo and Wes Iwundu as possible options. There really isn't an add to make unless you're in a very deep league. Simmons finished with just three points in 15 minutes.

Monroe and Alex Len will handle the  minutes at center or the Suns could go smaller with a hot Marquese Chriss.

            Austin Rivers (sore right Achilles) is questionable for Thursday against the Thunder..
        
        
             He did not play on Tuesday and Sunday, but Rivers is only day-to-day. C.J. Williams had a career night on Tuesday and may be asked to step up again. Rivers' Achilles injury looked a lot worse over the weekend, so getting back within a week would be great news.

            Nerlens Noel (thumb) has shed his cast and has returned to Dallas.
        
        
             Noel went to Cleveland to have his cast removed on Tuesday, but he's since returned to the team. He was originally hit with a rough three-week timetable, but he's now been out for four weeks and it's unclear exactly when he'll return to the court. He's basically just a deep league stash for those with an open IR-spot.

             He gets ruled out about an hour before tip time here and there aren't many details on his injury going forward. For tonight, it should be Boban Marjanovic time at least for 15-20 minutes while Eric Moreland and maybe even Anthony Tolliver pick up some extra minutes. Fire up Boban as a streamer and in DFS.

             Green was called questionable for this game due to an ankle tweak in practice, but it sounds like he'll be out there. The Warriors have been careful with their studs, so it's possible Green is somewhat limited. Plus, the Warriors do have a back-to-back set with a game in Houston tomorrow.

             Johnson hasn't done much as a starter this season, registering averages of 7.6 points, 4.4 boards, 2.8 assists and 1.0 steal per game, so he's not a great target despite the starter tag. Richaun Holmes should be able to flirt with minutes in the 20s sans Embiid, so he's someone to think about in DFS.

             This comes from the official Pistons reporter, so now we know why Drummond is on the injury report. The Pistons have been off since Saturday, so maybe Drummond suffered the injury in that game. Additionally, multiple reports from Miami say Drummond is closer to being out than in. If he's out, it'll be Happy Boban Marjanovic Day in DFS while Eric Moreland would also play more.

             He said before the game he can't shoot, and that he can't play if he can't shoot. That doesn't exactly bode well for Embiid to suit up on Friday against the Pistons. It'll be Amir Johnson getting the start while Richaun Holmes will back him up. Expect some extra Trevor Booker while the other rotation players will have more shots going their way.

             LeVert tweaked his groin on a go-ahead layup at the end of Monday's win over Orlando, and while he'll miss Wednesday's game, it doesn't sound like he'll be dealing with a lengthy absence here. As for tonight, Allen Crabbe, Joe Harris and Nik Stauskas figure to split most of LeVert's minutes.

He's priced cheaply across the industry and actually owns a 1.20 DK FPPM rate with Kawhi, Parker, Gay, Manu and Danny Green off the floor. Dejounte Murray actually leads the way in both usage rate (34.0%) and FPPM (1.38) in that split, so both players deserve a ton of attention as value options.

             The Spurs are sitting Kawhi Leonard, Tony Parker, Danny Green and Manu Ginobili in this game, so these starters should be logging some decent minutes. Murray's last game with heavy run was a successful one with 13 points, seven boards and six dimes in 25 minutes against the Kings on Dec. 23, so he's certainly in play as a DFS punt or as a streamer even on a busy Wednesday.

            Coach Stan Van Gundy said he was unsure if he would start Reggie Bullock or Anthony Tolliver vs. Miami on Wednesday.
        
        
             With Avery Bradley (groin) returning on Wednesday, either Bullock or Tolliver will get bumped to the bench. SVG may choose to play a bigger lineup based on matchups, with Tobias Harris at small forward and Tolliver at power forward. However, even if Bullock comes off the bench, he'll still likely log around 25 minutes a night, as Van Gundy has heaped praise on Bullock for his solid all-around play of late.

             Draymond Green tweaked his left ankle during Tuesday's practice, and it looks like we are headed towards a game-time decision. Wednesday's game against Dallas is the front end of a back-to-back, as the Dubs also play Thursday vs. Houston. Thus, coach Steve Kerr may choose to play it safe and hold out Green. Check back later in the day for an update. Jordan Bell would likely be inserted back into the starting lineup if either Green or Pachulia are unable to play, and would be a solid DFS target.

He is averaging 13.5 points, 7.5 assists, 4.0 rebounds and 2.0 steals over those two contests.

             The Dubs are on the front end of a back-to-back set going up against a team with just 13 wins, so it's not surprising to see these guys get the night off, but they should be back in action on Thursday in Houston. Patrick McCaw, Nick Young and Shaun Livingston will pick up the slack in their absence.

             Embiid will likely be a game-time call tonight, but him skipping shootaround isn't a great sign. If he's out, Ben Simmons will see the largest uptick in usage and Richaun Holmes will see extended minutes with the second unit. Check back closer to tip-off for official confirmation on Embiid's status.

Green hasn't played well enough this season to warrant a hold through this injury.

             ""[Leaving Cleveland] was inevitable,"" Irving said. ""I could feel it... They didn't want me there."" Irving reportedly caught wind of the Cavs front office including his name in trade talks back in June, which was a factor in prompting him to request a trade out of Cleveland. For what it's worth when LeBron James was asked about Irving's assertion that the Cavs didn't want him he simply responded: ""That makes absolutely no sense."" Tonight should be a fun matchup between the two former teammates in Boston, and Irving is on the DFS radar under the revenge game narrative.

            Scott Brooks has been impressed with John Wall's shot-blocking ability this season.
        
        
             ""It’s nothing I’ve seen before. Nothing I probably will see for a long time. I don’t know how to explain it,"" Brooks said of Wall’s shot-blocking ability. ""He has great instincts... Some of those shots that he blocks, they’re momentum-changers."" Wall leads all PGs in blocks per game this season at 1.08, and he also has amassed more swats than Marcin Gortat this season. Lame shooting percentages have weighed down his value this year, but it should only be a matter of time until we see those numbers revert to the mean. There's still room to buy-low here.

            Kobi Simmons played just three minutes and failed to score in Tuesday's loss to the Clippers.
        
        
             Simmons came in kind of hot, playing between 17 and 31 points in his previous four games and had a career-high 17 points on Dec. 30. There were no reports of an injury and he was pulled after missing a shot and never re-entered the game. Maybe the Grizzlies just wanted to get a pulse check on Mario Chalmers, but given how bad they are this season, the hope is that they'll keep giving Simmons minutes. Hopefully he's back to 20 minutes against the Wizards on Friday.

             Austin Rivers is having more evaluations and possibly a second opinion on his sore Achilles and Williams is on fire right now, averaging 30.6 points, 4.4 assists and 3.8 3-pointers over his last five games. The Clippers will continue to ride him with Patrick Beverley and Rivers injured, and Milos Teodosic struggling with his shot, so owners should just keep rolling him out there until further notice. Williams would be a sell-high guy if Rivers was definitely going to play, but with the Clippers guards banged up, there's no reason he can't keep wrecking opponents for the foreseeable future.

             He's hit double figures in scoring in four of his last 10 games and can hit 3-pointers, but he's going to struggle on most nights and doesn't do much outside of the occasional scoring night and knocking down 3-pointers. He could keep starting with Austin Rivers getting a second opinion on his Achilles injury, but is simply worth keeping an eye on in deep leagues. We need to see him play like this again a couple times before getting too excited.

             The Clippers have won four straight and Milos is playing better, although he's still not shooting it well. He's hit just 36 percent of his shots over his last five games, but has also knocked down 10 3-pointers over that stretch on 31 percent shooting. Maybe he should only shoot threes and focus on assists, but he's averaging 9.8 points, 3.2 rebounds, 6.4 assists and 2.0 3-pointers over his last five, and should keep getting better as the season progresses, and soon starts winding down.

             Griffin's 3-pointer came with less than two minutes left on the clock and gave the Clippers a 106-101 and he then coasted down the lane for a layup to seal the win for the Clippers. Griffin's only been back for three games, but he's looked really good in all of them. The Clippers have a back-to-back set on Jan. 10 & 11, so make sure he's good to go in both of those games, but he otherwise hasn't been restricted at all in his return.

             He missed most of the season with a quad injury and despite playing limited minutes in both of his recent games, he's scored in double figures in both of them.

But he'll need to see more minutes than he's gotten thus far in order for that to happen.

             He might have played even more minutes if he wouldn't have been in foul trouble, while Kobi Simmons played just three minutes in this one. This came out of nowhere, as Chalmers played just 13, 15 and 22 minutes in his last three games, as Simmons had been coming on. Chances are this was a fluke, as Chalmers hadn't scored in double figures since Dec. 15, so just keep an eye on him in case the Grizzlies are ready to turn back to him for some reason.

             Gasol got his coach fired earlier this season, but is in a bad funk right now, scoring 11 or fewer points in three of his last four games. He did have 27 points against the Warriors on Saturday, but has otherwise been struggling. The minutes were there tonight and he got a heavy dose of DeAndre Jordan, but Gasol has been a letdown over the last week. He should have a good matchup against Marcin Gortat on Friday so maybe he'll bounce back on national TV that night.

             Lamb has been steadily chugging along and had a nice game of 12 points, five rebounds, five assists and three steals on Sunday, as well. He's returning seventh-round fantasy value on the season and the return of Nicolas Batum really hasn't negatively impacted him as much as many of us thought it would. On a side note, the Hornets only turned the ball over three times as a team on the same night Damian Lillard had seven turnovers for the Blazers. Nic Batum was the only starter with a TO, while Frank Kaminsky was responsible for the other two. Incredible!

The fact he's not stealing or blocking as well as he used to is also disappointing, but Batum's elbow injury has impacted him heavily this season. He appears to finally be getting healthy and could be ready to take off, meaning this could be a buy-low opportunity. However, it's been a long season for his owners, and he hit just 4-of-14 shots for nine points in his previous game.

             He missed six straight games with a quad injury and just missed his career high of 18 points. He was struggling pretty badly prior to the injury, but looked fresh and motivated tonight. Maybe he's ready to get his season going after a slow start. Frank Mason will miss at least a week and Fox is the future in Sacramento, so it would make sense for them to give him as many minutes as he can handle going forward.

             He scored 19 points back on November 11, or he would have had a pair of career highs in this one. Unfortunately, he didn't provide any other stats outside of two turnovers, but he also hit 3-of-3 free throws. He had six points and two rebounds in 20 minutes off the bench behind Kosta Koufos on Sunday, and it's hard to figure out what the Kings will do with their lineup each night. But Skal was great in this one and if you've been wanting to grab him, this could be your sign, but keep in mind it's just one game and we don't know who the Kings will roll out as starters in the next one.

             Randolph had just four points and six boards in 18 minutes against Memphis on Sunday, so this was a big bounce-back game for him. This was his first double-double since Dec. 10, but he's generally played well enough to be owned in most fantasy leagues all season. Just keep an eye on the emergence of Skal Labissiere, as he, Randolph and Willie Cauley-Stein are all going to have to fight for extra minutes going forward.

             This was his third 30-point game of the season and the fourth of his career. He's on a tear right now with  22+ points in six out of his last seven games, and he's been a top-40 player in standard 9-category leagues in that span, averaging 25.0 points, 6.0 rebounds, 1.6 assists, 0.7 steals and 0.6 blocks on 54.7 percent shooting. That pace isn't sustainable, but Warren should be a mid-round guy going forward.

             He's scored 16, 14, 14 and 19 points in each of his last four games after bouncing up and down like a yo-yo before that. Belinelli's hit 24-of-43 shots and seven 3-pointers over that stretch, and looks like a low-end fantasy option in most leagues right now. It was thought that DeAndre Bembry might steal his job, or at least hurt him, but he's been struggling and is currently in the G-League.

             He was scoreless in the third quarter, but scored 16 of his 34 points in the fourth to help the Suns erase a 12-point deficit in the final five minutes. He was serenaded with MVP chants and deservedly so, as he helped the Suns pick up their sixth win in their last nine games. He's been unreal since returning from a two-week absence, averaging 31.0 points, 5.5 assists, 4.5 rebounds, 1.3 steals and 3.3 triples in his last four games.

             He was in foul trouble, had some dunk attempts blocked and struggled in general tonight. Collins is ice cold right now, hitting just 6-of-22 shots over his last three games, but is still averaging 8.6 points, 6.8 rebounds, 2.0 assists, 0.8 steals and 1.6 blocks over his last five. The Hawks still haven't fully unleashed him, but you have to think it's coming at some point. It might be tempting to drop him after his three-game struggle, but we'd still advise against it, unless you're in a small league with elite options available on the waiver wire.

             Unfortunately, he also fouled Devin Booker shooting a 3-pointer (he got all ball from behind, but also smashed the back of Booker's head), which helped hand the Suns the win, as Booker's three free throws put them up by one point with 12.3 seconds left in the game. Baze was great other than that and his 20 points were his highest since posting the same number way back on Dec. 12. Bazemore will look to keep it going on Friday against the Blazers, but the Hawks are stinging after blowing a 12-point lead with five minutes left in the game.

             This game was a far cry from Friday's 30-point game when he hit 12-of-16 shots and 5-of-6 3-pointers, but the minutes are there, the talent is there, and the young Hawks have no choice but to continue to play Prince heavy minutes every night. He saw his four-game streak of double-digit scoring nights broken tonight, but he should be able to start a new one against the Blazers on Friday.

             Talk about clutch. Chriss had two huge blocks in the fourth quarter including one in the final seconds which looked like an easy two points for Taurean Prince. Coach Jay Triano said his ""physical conditioning is a lot better now"" and it's really showed over the last couple weeks. ""We’re seeing him run the floor and get alley oops, we’re seeing him run down and get chase down blocks,"" Triano said. ""Those are the energy type things we expected from him that we weren’t getting earlier."" Chriss' fantasy arrow is pointing straight up and he'll be one of the hottest pickups with 12.2 points, 8.2 rebounds, 2.2 assists, 1.8 blocks, 0.8 steals and 1.8 triples over his last five games.

Maybe the Hawks will eventually turn to John Collins and limit Ilyasova's potential, but he's been playing really well for three straight weeks and should be owned everywhere. He's a ninth-round player on the season, but is a sixth-rounder over the past month.

The bad news is he played 37 minutes after seeing 33+ minutes in his previous four games, so knowing the Spurs, they may be tempted to rest him on Wednesday vs. Philly on the second night of a back-to-back set, especially with Joel Embiid (hand) not expected to play.

            Frank Ntilikina played just 16 minutes and hit just 1-of-4 shots (a 3-pointer) on Tuesday, finishing with three points and one assist in a 100-91 loss to the Spurs.
        
        
             Ntilikina, who was apparently not feeling well tonight, a fact Jeff Hornacek revealed after the game, was coming on and had played at least 27 minutes in each of his last four games, but had his seven-game streak of at least 20 minutes snapped tonight. Hornacek appeared to be frustrated with Frankie's lack of aggressiveness and pulled the plug on him early, which was also likely related to him being sick. Hopefully the message was received and Ntilikina will be feeling better and get back on track on Friday against the Wizards. There's still a decent chance he could replace Jarrett Jack as the starting point guard in New York at some point.

             He led the Knicks in scoring tonight and continues to impress, even with Kristaps Porzingis back from his knee injury. He's been great over his last three games, averaging 18.7 points, 8.7 rebounds, 1.0 steals, 1.0 blocks and has hit 22-of-40 shots (55%) over that stretch. He's an attractive fantasy add right now off waiver wires, but could go cold again at any time.

            Danny Green still isn't 100 percent according to Spurs coach Gregg Popovich and may be shut down for a while.
        
        
             He didn't look right on Tuesday vs. the Knicks, playing just 14 minutes with zero points, two rebounds, two assists and one steal. Green also didn't play at all in the second half. It's safe to assume that we won't see him on Wednesday vs. Philly, opening the door for guys like Bryn Forbes and maybe Brandon Paul. Green can be dropped in most leagues and is coming off a rough December with just three games with double digit points.

             Frank Ntilikina, who had been coming on and could replace Jack as the starter at some point, wasn't aggressive tonight and was benched by Jeff Hornacek after failing to even flirt with getting into the paint. Ntilikina played just 16 minutes, but could bounce back in his next one, and could eventually replace Jack. But for now, Jack's the better play, averaging 11 points, 4.0 rebounds, 6.3 assists and 0.8 steals over his last four, although he's not hitting threes lately.

             He's been starting for the Knicks again, but Michael Beasley is the non-Porzingis forward you want to own in New York. Thomas last hit double digits on Dec. 3 and has only done it three times all season. If he starts playing well and looks worthy of a potential pickup, we'll let you know, but this was likely a fluke.

            Kevin Love played through an illness on Tuesday vs. the Blazers and seemed fine, scoring 19 points on 5-of-7 shots.
        
        
             He was also 4-of-5 from beyond the arc and 5-of-6 from the line, adding seven rebounds, one block and one steal. Love didn't play in the fourth quarter due to the lopsided score and saw a total of 26 minutes, so as long as he doesn't have a setback overnight, we'd expect him to play on Wednesday vs. Boston. There are less touches to go around with Isaiah Thomas back, but Love should still be an early-round fantasy contributor.

             He was 0-for-11 in his return from injury on Dec. 21 and has hit half his shots in a game just one time in his last seven since then. He's shooting just 36 percent from the floor since his return (49-of-137). He's a career 44 percent shooter and is still right there for this season, so you have to think he breaks out of his shooting funk sooner than later. He'll try to get it going against the Wizards on Wednesday night and now looks like as good a time as any to try to buy low on Porzingis.

             There was a scary moment when LeBron James' elbow caught Wade in the back of the head, but luckily Wade was OK and he was able to carry on. He grabbed eight rebounds with three assists, but with Isaiah Thomas back from his hip injury, he's going to be very hard to trust in fantasy going forward as his minutes and usage will take a hit.

             The Cavaliers have another All-NBA weapon on the floor in Isaiah Thomas, so maybe that opens things up for Crowder -- there's some chemistry there as well from their Boston days. Crowder finished one point shy of his season-high in points and hit his most triples in a Cavs uniform, finishing 6-of-12 from the field in 24 minutes. He was pretty awful in December with 8.2 points, 2.9 rebounds, 1.0 assists, 0.9 steals and 1.1 triples, but keep an eye on him in case he heats up because he does have a proven track record of fantasy success in previous seasons.

             It's not a coincidence that the Cavaliers posted their second-highest scoring game of the season with IT2 back. He certainly didn't look like a player that has been out for seven months, finishing as a +17 during his time on the floor. Thomas wasn't shy on offense, jacking up five of his 12 shots in his first 5-minute stint. The score got out of hand late, so he played 19 minutes which was just shy of his 20-22 minute limit. As a reminder, he won't play against Boston on Wednesday, but he should make his first start as a Cavalier on Saturday vs. Orlando. It won't be long before he's churning out early-round fantasy value and tonight's performance was very encouraging.

             We're all going to miss Napier, who had become a DFS beast and a hot short-term pickup over the last five games, but it didn't take long for Lillard to completely ruin any value that Napier had. Actually, Napier has played well at times this season when Lillard was healthy, but he's nothing more than a deep-league flier now. It was fun while it lasted.

             There was no minutes restriction, he looked fantastic, and the high turnovers might have just been a result of some rust after missing his previous five games.

            Jusuf Nurkic hit 10-of-12 shots and 3-of-7 free throws for 23 points, seven rebounds, four assists and two steals in 29 minutes of Tuesday's 127-110 loss to the Cavaliers.
        
        
             It wasn't a season high in scoring, but it was his best offensive game since he scored 25 points way back on Nov. 30. Nurkic went through a cold spell around the time he injured his ankle in early December, but has been playing much better, averaging 15.8 points, 11.3 rebounds, 2.8 assists, 1.8 steals and 1.5 blocks over his last four games. His minutes are back up, he's healthy, and should continue to roll, at least until the next time he gets bitten by the injury bug.

            Al-Farouq Aminu, coming off a season-high 24 points and big line, hit just 1-of-7 shots (a 3-pointer) for five points, nine rebounds, two assists and a steal in Tuesday's 127-110 loss to the Cavaliers.
        
        
             Aminu's been quiet lately and has been showing up on some waiver wires, but went nuts with the big line on Monday. He was back to his more recent ways on Tuesday, but gets enough minutes each night (31.4 over his last five) and rebounds (8.2) that he tends to hold his value even when he's not being used as an offensive weapon. He should fare better on Friday against the Hawks.

            Evan Turner hit 7-of-14 shots and a 3-pointer for 15 points, eight rebounds, three assists and a block before fouling out of Tuesday's loss to the Cavaliers.
        
        
             Turner is suddenly feeling it after scoring 22 points with four boards, six assists and a steal on Monday night. He's gone on a few runs this season, although nothing quite as good as this two-game streak, but has had trouble staying hot for long. The fact he was this good tonight with Damian Lillard back in action was a bit surprising, but if he does it again on Friday against the Hawks, he'll be worth consideration in 12-team fantasy leagues.

He will undergo additional testing, so we wouldn't count on seeing him on Thursday vs. the Thunder. Jawun Evans may get another start and will try to bounce back after picking up four fouls in 14 minutes in his last one.

             An earlier report from Dave McMenamin of ESPN stated that Thomas' minutes would be capped in the 8-12 minute range, and head coach Tyronn Lue said he ""forgot"" how many minutes he was planning on giving to IT2 during his pregame presser, so there's a lot of uncertainty here. Thomas is safe to activate in all season-long settings, but he's not a great DFS target. For what it's worth, Lue did acknowledge that Thomas would be in the starting lineup for Saturday's game in Orlando, but he'll be coming off the bench today.

He's posted averages of 8.1 points, 7.7 boards, 2.7 assists, 1.2 blocks and 2.0 turnovers per contest through 14 games as a starter sans Paul Millsap (wrist), so he's on the radar as a potential low-end asset in deep leagues.

             Well, this is a bummer, as LeVert has recently been playing some of the best basketball of his career. He has scored in double digits in nine straight games and has dished out at least seven assists in four straight. On Monday, he tallied 15 points with eight assists, five rebounds, two steals in 27 minutes. If LeVert is unable to play Wednesday,  Allen Crabbe, Joe Harris, and Nik Stauskas would likely divvy up the excess minutes.

             Lillard draws a favorable matchup against the Cavs in his return from a five-game absence tonight, and with no minutes cap, he's someone to consider as a potential DFS target. Shabazz Napier will return to the bench with Lillard back in action, and he loses most of his luster in fantasy hoops with the return to the second unit.RotoGrinders.com Daily Slant: C.J. McCollum played 45 minutes last night with Shabazz Napier playing 41, so it's a little more clear why the Blazers don't want to ease Lillard into action in his first game back - his legs should be the freshest of the group. He's a fine target, especially in GPPs where we'd suspect the field will be a little hesitant to pay a premium for him straight off a return.

With Lopez sidelined, Kyle Kuzma, Julius Randle, and Andrew Bogut have seen an uptick in playing time.

             The Lakers didn't practice on Tuesday, and an earlier report from Lakers' reporter Tania Ganguli indicated that it was unlikely that Ball would be back in action for Wednesday's game, but we should have a better idea on his status based on his activity level at shootaround tomorrow. If he is able to get back out there, Tyler Ennis would return to the second unit and Josh Hart's minutes would take a hit. Lopez's imminent return is bad news for Julius Randle.

With Caris LeVert (groin) also appearing on the injury report with a doubtful-tag, guys like Allen Crabbe, Joe Harris and Nik Stauskas could be forced into heavy minutes tomorrow.

If Iguodala sits, his minutes will be divvied up between Omri Casspi, Nick Young and Patrick McCaw.

Clint Capela only missed two games with this injury earlier in the year, so we wouldn't expect Baker to miss too much time here.

            John Wall (rest) only went through warmups during Tuesday's practice, but Scott Brooks expects him to be fine for Wednesday's game against the Knicks.
        
        
             Wall played 41 minutes on Sunday, so it's not surprising at all to see Brooks take it easy on him at practice. There's currently no indication that Wall is in any danger of sitting out Wednesday's game. We talkin' bout practice; practice?

             X-rays on Embiid's sprained right hand came back negative, but it sounds like it's swelled up a bit since he sustained the injury on Sunday, and knowing how the 76ers tend to handle him, it looks like there's a good chance he'll be watching Wednesday's game from the sidelines. With him out, Ben Simmons' usage will spike and there will be more minutes available for Richaun Holmes. Check back for another update following Wednesday morning's shootaround.

             Ojeleye was able to practice in full on Tuesday and reportedly ""looked good,"" so he's on track to get back out there on Wednesday night following a four-game stint on the sidelines. That said, he's not a large enough part of the rotation in Boston for his playing status to matter in most leagues.

             Fultz will begin to ramp up his activities at practice and his conditioning work will increase, although the 76ers have still yet to provide an official timetable for his return. He does appear to be getting close, as he's progressed to going through 4-on-4 stuff, so getting through 5-on-5 work will be the next major development in this recovery process. T.J. McConnell and Jerryd Bayless' playing time will take a hit once Fultz is able to return to the rotation.

             Roberson won't play at all during the Thunder's upcoming three-game road trip (Tuesday vs. the Lakers, Thursday vs. the Clippers or Sunday vs. the Suns). The Thunder then return home next Tuesday to take on the Blazers. We'll see if Roberson can rejoin the team next week. Josh Huestis replaced Roberson in the starting lineup Sunday night, but failed to score a single point and grabbed just one rebound in 19 minutes. Alex Abrines had three points and one rebound in 15 minutes off the bench. This is a situation to avoid from a fantasy perspective.

             Jackson, the No. 31 overall pick in the 2017 draft, underwent successful surgery to repair a fifth metatarsal fracture in his right foot back on September 1st. He was initially expected to miss 3-4 months. He is hopeful that he can return to the court in January. However, even when fully healthy, Jackson will have a difficult time securing consistent playing time in the Pelicans crowded backcourt.

Reggie Bullock and Luke Kennard have both played well in December and Avery Bradley (groin) is expected to return to the lineup on Wednesday.

Reggie Bullock and Luke Kennard have both played well with Bradley out of the lineup, but Kennard will see his minutes reduced with Bradley back in the mix. Bradley will also likely be asked to handle the ball a bit more due to Reggie Jackson (ankle) being sidelined for 6-8 weeks.

            Victor Oladipo (sore right knee) has been ruled out of Wednesday's game vs. Milwaukee.
        
        
             We haven't received an update on Oladipo since the weekend, but the fact that he has already been ruled out of Wednesday's contest is certainly not encouraging. It will be the fourth straight game he has missed. Lance Stephenson, who has started in place of Oladipo, has been the biggest beneficiary. Over the Pacers last three games, Stephenson is averaging 13.0 points, 9.3 rebounds, 3.7 assists and 1.7 treys.

             Despite being able to contribute on the offensive end, Abrines has played fewer than 10 minutes in four of the Thunder's last six games due to his defensive lapses. ""Listen, he's never gonna be Andre Roberson,"" Donovan said. ""He's just not. But he still has the ability, I think, to be a good team defender."" Abrines is averaging just 2.3 points in 11.6 minutes over OKC's last ten games. He should be left on the waiver wire.

             Lillard has missed five straight games, but had been close to returning on Saturday and was then held out of Monday's contest, partly because it was the front end of a back-to-back. Hopefully, the extra rest will help Lillard avoid suffering a setback on Tuesday night. No word yet if Portland plans to limit his minutes in his first game back. With Lillard returning to the starting lineup, Shabazz Napier will get bumped back to the bench.

""Overall he’s handled it great. He has another opportunity [Tuesday] with them."" If he continues to avoid setbacks, we will see LaVine back on the floor by mid-January. He is worth a stash, especially in league's that have IR spots.

Out here you have a game every other night. Really just gotta tough it out or sit."" The Lakers aren't practicing on Tuesday, so we may have to wait until Wednesday morning for a reliable update on his status.

I think I’ll start to get him some minutes,"" Atkinson said Monday. ""Like anybody, you’ve got to earn it with play. Let’s see him in small doses and hopefully build him up to bigger minutes."" However, even after Okafor is back in the mix, it's unlikely he'll log enough minutes to make a fantasy impact, as he will have to split playing time with Tyler Zeller, Jarrett Allen, Quincy Acy and Timofey Mozgov.

The minutes were also a season-high and this is an aberrant game for Aminu, but he's a solid pickup in category-leagues, especially 9-cat.

             Connaughton unexpectedly dropped 24 points on opening night, but this was the sixth time all season he's cracked double-digits. He's earning consistent minutes in the low- to mid-20s, though he rarely contributes more than a handful of points and 3-pointers.

             The Blazers big man was a handful defensively and on the glass tonight, but he's obviously been missing Damian Lillard (hamstring) on offense. In five games without Dame drawing attention and setting him up for easy buckets, Nurkic has averaged 10.8 points on 32.8% shooting from the field. The good news is that Lillard is expected back on Tuesday, so owners can anticipate better returns vs. the Cavaliers (Tuesday) and Hawks (Friday).

             McCollum scored Portland's final six points in OT, and his flurry late in regulation is the only reason they were in position to win on the road tonight. As if that weren't enough, C.J. even dished out some fantasy advice regarding teammate Damian Lillard after the game. He said he couldn't speak to how Lillard feels or whether he'll play on Tuesday, before adding, ""But if I’m a fantasy owner, I’d start him.""

             Napier added one 3-pointer without any turnovers in 41 minutes of action, helping Portland prevail on the road in Chicago. He burned bright in Damian Lillard's absence, but with Lillard due back on Tuesday his value will take a big hit overnight. Over the past five games, the 26-year-old PG has averaged 18.0 points, 1.8 triples, 5.0 assists, 4.6 rebounds, 2.2 steals and 0.4 blocks. He's an obvious handcuff in deep leagues.

             Evan Turner got off to a hot start tonight, so maybe coach Fred Hoiberg just wanted Nwaba out there for defensive purposes. He and Valentine have been in a position battle for a while now, and they're both likely to earn minutes in the mid-20s regardless of who starts vs. Toronto on Wednesday. Most category-league owners should steer clear of Nwaba's horrible FT shooting (61.8% on 3.2 attempts).

He's now played 28 or more minutes in three straight games, averaging 20.6 points, 11.3 rebounds, 2.6 assists and 1.0 blocks in that span. He'll look to keep his momentum going against the Thunder on Wednesday, and he would see a nice bump if Kyle Kuzma (quad) can't go.

He played the final 12:34 tonight, including the entirety of overtime, and this marks RoLo's highest playing time since Dec. 13. He's likely to fall into the mid-20s again on Wednesday, but games like this are the reason he's clung to relevance in 12-team leagues.

             Mirotic watched from the bench down the stretch of the Bulls' OT loss tonight, and it's unclear whether his injury affected the decision. He was reportedly ""fine to play,"" but added that he didn't mind Fred Hoiberg sticking with Robin Lopez alongside Lauri Markkanen. Meanwhile, Hoiberg said he stayed with RoLo to combat Jusuf Nurkic's size in the middle. There's no reason to think Mirotic might miss Wednesday's home game vs. the Raptors -- we'll keep a close eye on his status, but are leaving him off the injury report.

            Andrew Wiggins scored 21 points (7-of-16 FGs, 6-of-7 FTs) with a season-high nine rebounds on Monday vs. the Lakers, adding four assists, one steal, one block and one triple in 35 minutes.
        
        
             It's not often that we see Wiggins fill up the boxscore outside of the scoring column like tonight, but a matchup against the 11-25 Lakers probably helped. He's starting to heat up again with 21 points in three out of his last four games, but just like his previous three seasons in the NBA, fantasy owners are still waiting for the peripheral stats to come around -- he was averaging just 3.9 rebounds, 1.7 assists, 0.6 blocks and 1.2 steals prior to tonight.

             Snell played 36 minutes on Friday but he was marginalized in the rotation tonight -- the Bucks closed the game with an extra-small lineup of Eric Bledsoe, Matthew Dellavedova, Malcolm Brogdon, Khris Middleton, and Giannis Antetokounmpo. If you've held onto Snell this long as a steals-and-threes specialist, you're used to random disappearances.

             Maker went 3-of-4 from downtown tonight, and he rounded out his big game with one assist, one steal and one block. This was the second time all season that he's scored double-digit points (he had 16 points on Nov. 22), and he did it despite sitting out the final 12:22 of this overtime thriller. He's hard to trust while John Henson and Giannis Antetokounmpo are healthy.

             This was the first time the Bucks have faced the Raptors since being eliminated in the first round of the playoffs last season. Raptors coach Dwane Casey said before the game, ""Bledsoe gives another piece to the equation that we’ve got to guard."" He was right, and Bledsoe drilled a 3-pointer to open the overtime period tonight, but ultimately his efforts weren't enough. For fantasy purposes, EB has been solid in Milwaukee and he's returning top-50 value over the past month.

             This follows a nine-assist performance from Friday, and Dellavedova hit a crucial 3-pointer tonight to give the Bucks a two-point lead in a game they eventually lost in OT. He hasn't scored double-digit points since Nov. 11, of course, and there should be more appealing assists-specialists on any waiver wire.

             He made 9-of-18 FGs and 7-of-9 FTs with a 3-pointer tonight, but didn't have any steals, blocks or turnovers in 42 minutes of action. This marks the fifth time all season that Giannis has been held without a defensive stat, so that's not a concern, and the low turnovers are worth highlighting. He leads the NBA's official fantasy scoring at 55.0 fantasy-points per game, but among the top five players his turnovers (2.8) are easily the lowest -- the other four are between 4.4 and 4.8 per game.

             He played just nine minutes in the first half after picking up three early fouls, but salvaged his line with the five dimes and pair of steals. Jones was a game-high +23 in the win, and his owners can expect a much better fantasy line on Wednesday vs. the Nets -- Brooklyn has allowed the fourth most fantasy points to PGs this season.

             Towns had three fouls in the first half and was forced to the bench early, but the superstar center still managed to record his league-leading 30th double-double of the season. He also had one assist, two steals, two triples and yet another block, giving him 18 total swats over his last six games. Because of his durability and consistency, he can be treated like a top-5 fantasy asset the rest of the way.

             As much as we'd like to get excited about this line, Dieng's big night was a result of Karl-Anthony Towns' foul trouble -- Dieng scored 13 points in the first half with KAT picking up three early fouls. The big man played just 19.8 minutes per game in December and things are going to be even trickier in January with Nemanja Bjelica healthy again. He's a deep-league asset, at least until Taj Gibson's wheels fall off.

             The Raptors won their 12th consecutive home game tonight, and OG's subtle contributions are a big reason for that success -- he's an efficient spot-up shooter who is typically wide open, and he's a versatile defender. That said, the rookie had a usage rate of 2.3% in his 35 minutes tonight, which is hard to do even if you're trying. He's only worth considering in 16-team leagues and deeper as a threes-and-steals specialist.

             This was the second time since late November that the Raptors have had their full roster healthy -- they ran a 10-man rotation tonight, with Lucas Nogueira and Powell as the odd-men out. Powell signed a four-year, $42 million extension this summer and the Raptors think highly of him, but he's yet to provide reliable fantasy value outside of the deepest leagues. He didn't help his case for minutes by shooting a combined 27.5% in Toronto's previous six games.

             Ibaka's rhythm was off all night offensively and he went 0-of-5 from deep, including some wide-open misses. The opposite was true on defense, however, as he came up with multiple key plays to fend off the Bucks in an eventual 131-127 home win. He played center down the stretch due to the Bucks' small lineups, and that versatility is partly why his minutes rose to 29.4 per game in December (from 26.8 in November).

             Simmons scored 20+ points five times in December and has really stepped up for an injury-depleted Orlando squad, but he's cooled off lately, hitting just 30.4 percent of his shots in his last five games. He's averaging just 9.4 points, 5.0 rebounds, 2.8 assists, 1.0 steals and 1.2 triples in that span, but most fantasy owners should be patient with him. The good news is that his workload hasn't fallen off, as he's only played less than 30 minutes one time since the start of December.

            Bismack Biyombo pulled down a season-high 17 rebounds on Monday vs. the Nets to go with 13 points and three blocks in 29 minutes.
        
        
             The Nets have allowed the second most fantasy points to centers this season, so Biyombo predictably had a big night. This was the sixth game of his career with 17 or more rebounds and this was his most in a Magic uniform. If his first four games as the fill-in starter for Nikola Vucevic (hand) are any indication, Biyombo is going to be a lot of fun to own for the next 1.5 months or so with averages of 9.5 points, 13.0 rebounds and 3.2 blocks in that span.

            Aaron Gordon's 20 points and 12 rebounds weren't enough in Monday's loss to the Nets.
        
        
             Gordon's shot selection tonight wasn't great, and he finished just 8-of-20 from the field and 2-of-3 from the line with one steal and two triples. The good news is that his floor going forward is going to be even higher, as he played some backup center tonight and logged a team-high 41 minutes -- coach Frank Vogel said before the game that he's going to use Gordon there in certain situations. His fantasy arrow continues to point up and his 20-12 effort comes on the heels of a 39-point game on Saturday.

             JV didn't have any assists, steals or blocks tonight, and he watched the final 23:37 from the bench. Toronto rolled with a lot of Serge Ibaka at center in small lineups late, but Milwaukee forced their hand with Giannis Antetokounmpo at center. Valanciunas has proven he can produce with minutes in the 22-26 range, which is where he should be vs. Robin Lopez and the Bulls on Wednesday.

             It just wasn't his night. Fournier couldn't stay out of foul trouble with five total, and his game-tying 3-point attempt was blocked with seven seconds left on the clock. He failed to grab a single rebound in 33 minutes, dishing out just one assist with a steal and a block. Fournier had a 23-point game on Saturday and his right ankle and foot issues are behind him, so expect a bounce-back performance on Wednesday in Houston in what should be a shootout.

             DeRozan added eight assists, five rebounds, one steal and one block in 43 minutes, but those contributions were overshadowed by the offensive fireworks. He dropped 21 points in the first quarter alone, including three 3-pointers, and finished 5-of-9 beyond the arc on the night. The perimeter shooting is a big story for his fantasy value -- he's a combined 20-of-38 over the past seven games, which is the most he's ever attempted or made in a seven-game stretch. He's settling into top-40 value and will go higher if this 3-point barrage proves to be sustainable. It's a Happy New Year indeed for DeRozan's fantasy owners.

             The three blocks are a career-high and one of them stopped the game from going to overtime when he swatted Evan Fournier's 3-point attempt with seven seconds left. Crabbe was not fun to own in December with averages of 10.6 points, 4.1 rebounds, 1.7 assists, 0.6 steals and 2.2 triples on 35.2 percent shooting, and he's a volatile fantasy asset that should be treated as a boom-or-bust option.

             He was 6-of-15 from the field and 2-of-3 from the line and had arguably the play of the game with a driving and-one layup with about a minute remaining (link below). LeVert (8 assists) has now registered 7+ assists in each of his last 4 games, becoming just the 2nd Net since 1983-84 to record 7+ assists in 4 straight games off the bench (Deron Williams in the 2013-14 season). He's also scored in double digits in nine straight games which is a career-high, so it's a crime that he's not owned in more leagues.

             It wasn't Dinwiddie's best game, but he was clutch with a huge 3-pointer late in the fourth quarter. Even with D'Angelo Russell (knee) targeting a return in mid-January, Dinwiddie's owners shouldn't be too concerned because coach Kenny Atkinson won't rule out the idea of those two guys starting beside each other. He had top-90 value in standard 9-cat leagues in December and has been a fantastic waiver-wire pickup.

We've reached the two-week mark, of course, so hopefully Memphis will provide a substantive update in the next few days. For what it's worth, he put in an ""extensive"" post-practice workout on Friday and has been ramping up his activity lately.

             This is Parsons' third straight DNP and getting ruled out a day in advance is never encouraging. Memphis doesn't play again until Friday, when they host the Wizards, so maybe they're playing it safe with that home game as a target. Until Parsons returns, expect his minutes to be split between Jarell Martin and JaMychal Green.

             A Grade 2 strain means a partial tear, so while Harden will be re-evaluated in two weeks, he's not a lock to return right after that -- hamstring injuries can linger and Houston will make sure he's 100 percent before he plays again. His owners should be prepared to be without him until at least mid-January. While the MVP candidate is out, Chris Paul will be much more involved offensively, Eric Gordon will see a bump in playing time and touches, while Gerald Green should get decent burn as a 3-point shooter off the bench.

            Frank Mason (bruised right heel) will not play on Tuesday vs. the Hornets.
        
        
             Mason wasn't able to return to Sunday's game after picking up the injury and it's usually not a good sign when a player is ruled out a full day before tip-off. George Hill is looking at a heavy workload vs. Charlotte, and the good news for the Kings is that De'Aaron Fox (quad) is nearing a return and could be back on Tuesday.

             Dunn's knee didn't seem to bother him at all in his return from a one-game stint on the sidelines on Sunday, and with him getting out there for the second game of a back-to-back, it's safe to assume the knee will be a non-issue moving forward. He's been crushing it lately, so he's someone to think about deploying in DFS with a favorable matchup against Portland.

             Lillard has been ramping up his activity at practice, but it's probably unrealistic to expect him to take the court prior to getting through a full practice, something he has not yet accomplished. With Lillard unavailable tonight, Shabazz Napier will earn another start and he's on the radar as a streamer or DFS target. This is the first game of a back-to-back, leaving Lillard no time to practice prior to Tuesday's game in Cleveland, so for now, we'll consider him doubtful for that one.

             Presumably, Atkinson is ready to throw Okafor out there now that his conditioning and familiarity with the offense is where he'd like it to be, so it'll be interesting to see how many minutes he can get in his first game back since December 15. He's someone to think about as a speculative add in deep leagues, but if you're in a 12-team league with 13 roster spots, he's still not quite worth owning.

             Tuesday's game will be the first of a back-to-back set, so Leonard will likely be taking the night off on Wednesday in Philadelphia, as he hasn't yet been cleared for back-to-backs. The Spurs have another back-to-back set on Jan. 7-8, and if he sits out the first game of that back-to-back, that would give Leonard just two games played this week. He's a risky guy to deploy in weekly leagues.

He's still building up his cardio, and Atkinson clearly wants him to have an in-depth understanding of Brooklyn's system, so it sounds like it'll be another few weeks before Okafor gets out there. With an uncertain return date and role in Brooklyn, he's not all that attractive of a stash in most 12-team leagues.

             Thomas will not play the following game on Wednesday in Boston, but the wait is finally over, and IT2's ownership percentage should immediately shoot up to 100. The back-to-back sets will likely be a non-option for a while, and he'll likely deal with a minutes cap for at least his first few weeks of being back, but Thomas has a great shot of production first-round value once he's fully up to speed. Jose Calderon's days of relevancy in fantasy hoops are numbered.

Dinwiddie has thrived as the starting PG and Russell is really strong off the ball, so Dinwiddie's owners should remain optimistic about his rest-of-season outlook even with Russell possibly coming back in January.

            Nets coach Kenny Atkinson said D'Angelo Russell (knee) is ""progressing along with our schedule.""
        
        
             The Nets haven't been very transparent, so we'll take what we can get. ""I’d just say he’s working his tail off. I was watching him in the gym yesterday. It’s an arduous process,"" Atkinson said. ""He’s putting in a ton of time, he’s putting in full days. It’s been amazing to see his work ethic. He’s been great."" Nets GM Sean Marks previously hinted that we could see Russell return in January, and it's now been more than six weeks since he underwent minor knee surgery. His fantasy owners just need to hang in there a bit longer.

             ""Hopefully it is not that serious, just a pull on the hammy,"" Harden said. ""Just got some treatment right now and hopefully, day to day, it gets better."" He wasn't able to return to the game and had a noticeable limp in the locker room afterwards. Coach Mike D'Antoni said that it was too early to tell in regards to the severity, but expect the Rockets to provide an update later this afternoon. For now, Harden should be considered questionable for Wednesday's game vs. the Magic. If he does miss time, Eric Gordon and Gerald Green would soak up most of his minutes and Chris Paul will have more on his plate on the offensive end.

             ""It’s really just about getting him where he’s at his best and not yo-yoing him in and out of the games and having him re-tweak it,"" head coach Frank Vogel said. ""He’s got to get his strength in the ankle and strength in his legs with conditioning so that it’s not an issue anymore."" Isaac missed 17 consecutive games from Nov. 13 through Dec. 16, but when he did return he kept aggravating the injury. Despite his upside, Isaac is now just a luxury stash if you have an I.R. spot. Mario Hezonja will hold down the fort behind Aaron Gordon at the four in the meantime.

Embiid said after the game that he thinks he should be fine and wants to play through the discomfort, but that decision may not be his to make. With only two games this week, Embiid is a risky start in weekly leagues if we don't get a positive update before lineups lock.

Miami's training staff were probably sweating when Whiteside removed the bulky brace, but it's a sign that the big man is confident that his knee is fine. He finished that game with nine points, 13 rebounds and four assists in 29 minutes, and barring any setbacks his workload should continue to grow this week.

""There was something jammed, they unjammed it, so I’ve just got to continue to strengthen it, but its not a problem."" An MRI came back negative for structural damage, fortunately, and this curious injury doesn't sound like it will cost Rivers much time, but we're still considering him questionable for Tuesday until L.A. officially updates his status.

            Marquese Chriss fouled out in 20 minutes on Sunday, but he still had 12 points, seven rebounds, two assists, two blocks, two 3-pointers and one steal.
        
        
             There were four turnovers in the mix as well, but anyone who deployed Chriss has to be satisfied with tonight's output. The 20-year-old's fouls and turnovers have dipped on a per-36-minute basis, compared to his rookie season, and he's quietly putting together across-the-board stats over the past four games. Chriss has given fantasy owners migraines this season, which is why he's on the waiver wire in most leagues, but sheer rest-of-season potential makes him an intriguing pickup.

             Chandler hit 5-of-8 field goals while going 0-of-2 at the line tonight -- meanwhile, Alex Len was quiet in 17 bench minutes and Greg Monroe racked up another DNP-CD. If you're relying on Chandler as a rebounds and FG% specialist in deep leagues, be aware that he's likely to be rested during the Suns' back-to-back set on Tuesday and Wednesday.

He's played between 14 and 16 minutes in each of the past seven games, which says plenty about his lack of fantasy appeal.

             Philly's Rookie-of-the-Year frontrunner made 7-of-11 field goals and 7-of-11 free throws tonight, and the defensive stats continue to buoy his fantasy appeal in a variety of formats. All but one of Simmons' makes came in the restricted area tonight, which is exactly what owners hope to see -- he's shooting 68.2% in the restricted area this season, but a combined 33.2% everywhere else on the court. If he expands his shooting range, the sky is the limit.

Joel Embiid did injure his right hand tonight but X-rays were negative and it sounds like a sprain -- if he is forced to miss Wednesday's game vs. the Spurs, Holmes will instantly be an appealing streaming and DFS play.

He'll get a stiffer test vs. San Antonio on Wednesday.

             De'Aaron Fox (quad) was initially ruled out through early January, but the Kings did list him as 'doubtful' prior to being ruled out tonight. That suggests he could be back sooner, but it's rarely fruitful to guess what the Kings are thinking with injury designations or rotations. In the meantime, Hill should continue to earn the bulk of the minutes at PG, especially if Frank Mason (bruised heel) misses any games.

             It was Green's second game back after a three-game absence, so the benching may have been intended to limit his workload in a blowout. It could also have been a message from coach J.B.

Selden will need to earn playing time going forward, and Memphis will likely keep him on a short leash, so there's no real incentive to add him. We'll keep a close eye on his role over the next few weeks.

He's had a handful of strong games, but even as a starter Martin has failed to distinguish himself with averages of 6.4 points, 4.5 rebounds, 1.0 blocks and 0.7 steals.

             There were a variety of factors in play tonight, including the lopsided score and the return of Wayne Selden (quad), who logged 17 minutes off the bench. It sounds like Mike Conley (Achilles) is also inching closer to a return, so don't hesitate to unload Harrison for a more promising rest-of-season option.

             Despite having just two games on the schedule next week, it will be hard to keep Tyreke out of fantasy lineups. After all, he's been a top-10 fantasy player over the past two weeks with averages of 27.0 points (51.6% FGs, 85.2% FTs), 3.6 triples, 5.8 rebounds, 7.4 assists and 1.2 steals. He's doing all that with a mere 1.6 turnovers per game, and is resuscitating his image at an ideal time, with free agency looming this summer. He's obliterating even the most optimistic preseason fantasy expectations.

             The Sixers think Embiid sprained his hand, and he added, ""I think I should be fine ... It was numb but I'm a warrior. I want to push through stuff and I want to play."" He's been phenomenal this season with averages of 24.0 points, 1.0 threes, 11.0 rebounds, 3.4 assists, 2.0 blocks and 0.6 steals, but has also missed nine of the Sixers' first 38 games. Philly's cautious approach has helped him avoid lengthy injuries, of course, which is a trade-off most owners will gladly accept. We'll consider him questionable to play vs. the Spurs on Wednesday.

Tarik Black also supplanted Nene in the rotation after halftime, as the Rockets tried in vain to slow down Julius Randle, and there's simply no reason to trust Nene for fantasy purposes.

Make sure he's locked into active lineups with three games next week.

The veteran sharp-shooter could take on a bigger offensive workload if James Harden misses games -- Harden exited late in the fourth quarter after pulling his left hamstring. Gerald Green and Eric Gordon would also stand to gain without Harden, but it would take a complete team effort.

             Hart made the most of his minutes and his hot shooting was a surprise, since the knock against him has always been his jumper -- he did go just 4-of-8 from the FT line, so it wasn't all good news. Lonzo Ball (left shoulder) has been ruled out for Monday and it's uncertain if he'll be ready to go vs. OKC on Wednesday. Kentavious Caldwell-Pope will also miss Monday's game, which at least gives Hart one more game with an expanded role in the Lakers' short-handed backcourt. After Monday, though, all bets are off.

             Randle attacked the rim early and often tonight, with 14 points and seven boards in the first quarter alone. The scoring and rebounding were both season-highs and he's thriving with expanded minutes over the past two games. Lakers coach Luke Walton recently called him out for sometimes not ""playing up to the standard that he set for himself,"" and that seems to have lit a fire for Randle. He's been a volatile option all season, but tonight's big game is a reminder of his tantalizing upside.

             Ennis shot 8-of-18 from the field and 4-of-5 from the line before eventually fouling out. Kentavious Caldwell-Pope was out tonight -- he and Lonzo Ball will also miss Monday's road game. That props open the door for Ennis, who is a fine streaming play vs. the Wolves on Monday, but this is an inherently short-lived situation.

             The bad news is that Teodosic didn't get to the free throw line, didn't have any steals or blocks, and he committed three turnovers. He's averaging decent assists (5.3) and 3-pointers (1.7), but is dragging down owners with limited value elsewhere and damaging 34.0% shooting. We expect him to fare better in 2018, but it can't hurt to get a feel for his trade value in your leagues.

Rivers is just day-to-day after an MRI came back negative, so he could return as soon as Tuesday vs. the Grizzlies. As a result, Evans should continue drifting along the waiver wire.

             Sweet Lou checked in earlier than usual with the Clippers' starting backcourt in foul trouble, and he quickly took matters into his own hands. It was a no-win situation for Charlotte -- when they tried to throw multiple defenders at him, Williams either found open teammates or drew fouls. He came in with a league-leading 20.5 points per game off the bench this season, which is only going up after tonight's scoring bonanza. He'll maintain a lofty usage rate if Austin Rivers (Achilles) misses more games.

             Kaminsky hit 6-of-12 FGs and 2-of-2 FTs with just one turnover in 31 minutes off the bench. That's his highest playing time since Oct. 23 and he took advantage of Marvin Williams' poor play, in addition to the continued absence of Cody Zeller (knee), who will miss at least 3-4 more weeks. Kaminsky isn't the most consistent option, but he's worth a look if you need a cheap big man -- just be aware that Charlotte only plays twice next week.

His lack of blocks and poor shooting tonight are aberrations and he should torch the Kings frontcourt on Tuesday, but the turnovers are here to stay. His 3.4 turnovers per game are eighth-most in the league, and among centers he trails only DeMarcus Cousins and Joel Embiid.

             That's two scoreless games in a row for Williams, who has flopped in a seemingly favorable situation with Cody Zeller (knee surgery) out of commission. He was outplayed tonight by both Frank Kaminsky (31 minutes) and Johnny O'Bryant (14 minutes), but we've seen Williams struggle before only to recover with mid-round value. A recent finger injury is a likely suspect for his struggles, but it's understandable if you can't wait for him to turn things around.

            Josh McRoberts (lower extremity injury) picked up a DNP-CD on Sunday.
        
        
             Prior to the game, coach Rick Carlisle said there was an ""outside chance"" McRoberts would make his season debut tonight. He was technically 'available' to play, but in a hard-fought game there was no opportunity to give him some maintenance minutes. Maybe we'll see him vs. the Warriors on Wednesday.

             The Mavs are setting lofty expectations for DSJ. ""We think he can be a great player, one of the best players to ever play in a Mavericks' uniform,"" coach Rick Carlisle said this weekend. Poor percentages and high turnovers have stunted his fantasy appeal in category leagues, but he's showing the raw upside that drove his value on draft day. Now he just needs to do it consistently, and tonight was another step in that direction -- he made 5-of-12 FGs and 6-of-7 FTs, but took over late with 13 of his points in the final quarter.

That's added up to mid-round value for roto purposes, and he's worth a look if you need a cheap source of scoring, 3-pointers and especially assists.

             OKC's big three combined to score 84 points tonight, but faulty defense and a lack of supporting production led to a brutal 116-113 loss to the lowly Mavericks. Felton hasn't been a reliable fantasy asset for many years, and occasionally leading the Thunder bench in scoring isn't exactly a resume-builder -- they rank 28th in bench scoring, ahead of only the Pelicans and Bucks.

             OKC lost for just the second time in their past eight games, including a controversial non-call that led to Friday's loss to the Bucks. PG-13 added two blocks and one steal tonight, and the Thunder out-rebounded the Mavs 45-36, but they were outscored by 12 points in the paint and gave up far too many easy buckets. With a few days off before Wednesday's road game in L.A., George's knee shouldn't be a lingering issue.

He headed straight to the locker room, finishing with 40 points, 11 assists, two steals and two blocks in 41 minutes. He was already dealing with a bruised right foot, but that injury didn't seem to be a factor tonight -- all eyes will be on the health of his hamstring. Mike D'Antoni said the team isn't likely to assess Harden's injury until Monday, but we should have an update in the afternoon. If he misses time, Eric Gordon and Gerald Green stand to absorb most of his minutes.

             This was RHJ's fourth career game with at least 20 & 10, and he's in the midst of a breakout season in both reality and fantasy -- he's flirting with top-60 value in roto leagues, despite playing under 28 minutes per game. He's had just three DNPs, after missing four games during the entire 2016-17 season, so we can add durability to the growing list of reasons to target him.

            The Nets concluded their five-game road trip with a loss vs. the Celtics, despite Caris LeVert's 16 points, seven assists, six rebounds, two steals and two 3-pointers in 30 minutes.
        
        
             LeVert has scored double-digit points in eight straight games, which is the longest streak of his career according to the Nets PR department. He has been holding steady as a mid-round value over the past month, despite averaging a modest 28.2 minutes per game. His role as a playmaker could be complicated by the eventual return of D'Angelo Russell (knee), but he plays multiple positions and the Nets have plenty of incentive to keep him on the court.

             Acy is hot from distance over the Nets' past three games, shooting a combined 8-of-11 from downtown.

             The Nets have encouraged Zeller to extend his shooting range this season, and he's stepped up to the challenge. He's a combined 7-of-17 from deep this year after attempting just one 3-pointer in 211 games as a member of the Celtics. That said, tonight's line is the latest proof that he's a liability in fantasy leagues, especially with Jahlil Okafor lurking in the background.

             The Pacers fell behind 17-0 tonight before briefly clawing their way back into the game, and Turner's struggles were a big part of the problem. He had just one point at halftime and was frustrated by Karl-Anthony Towns at both ends tonight. The Pacers' offense is sputtering without Victor Oladipo (knee), whose absence has done nothing to benefit Turner's fantasy value. That said, Turner will bounce back quickly and this is nothing but a buy-low moment.

             Stephenson played 22 minutes and he'll have the ball in his hands a lot if Oladipo misses more games. The bad news is that Indiana only plays twice next week, Wednesday and Saturday, and Oladipo is currently day-to-day with soreness and swelling. Still, if you picked up Stephenson it makes sense to hold him until Oladipo has a clear return date.

             Young made 7-of-11 FGs and 3-of-3 FTs in 24 minutes tonight, as the bench provided a bright spot in an otherwise dreary loss to the visiting Wolves. The third-year guard is making the most of his playing time while Victor Oladipo (knee) is unavailable, but there's no reason to touch him outside of the deepest formats.

             How much did the Pacers miss Victor Oladipo (knee) tonight? Suffice to say, none of their starters scored a point until Collison's basket with under five minutes left in the first half. Bojan Bogdanovic led the starting unit with 13 points, Thaddeus Young added eight points and three boards, and none of Indy's starters logged more than 22 minutes tonight. Collison and co. will look to regroup on Wednesday vs. the Bucks, the first of two games next week.

             Towns made 6-of-11 FGs and 5-of-6 FTs to help Minnesota atone for Thursday's loss to the Bucks. His shot-blocking helped the Wolves stymie the Pacers' offense -- they shot 38.8% from the field -- and he completely out-played Myles Turner, who scored one point with two rebounds tonight. He's yet to miss a game this season and is cruising along as an elite fantasy center.

            Markieff Morris pulled down a season-high 11 rebounds during Sunday's win over Chicago but didn't do much else with just five points and two steals over 24 minutes.
        
        
             Morris went 1-of-6 from the field and missed his only 3-point shot, so while the boards were nice, he simply needs to bring a lot more to the stat sheet to warrant a roster spot in standard 12-team leagues. Kelly Oubre finished with 12 points, five boards, three assists, two triples and one turnover in 20 minutes off the bench, and so far this season, Oubre has been the power forward that you want to own in Washington.

            Mike Scott (personal) got hot in 27 minutes off the bench on Sunday, scoring 17 points on 7-of-11 shooting to go with four boards, three 3-pointers, one assist and one block.
        
        
             Scott's jumper was working for him in this one, as he didn't even miss his first shot until late in the third quarter, and he took advantage of some increased opportunity with Markieff Morris in foul trouble through the first half of action. He's been hit-or-miss lately, being held to single digits in the scoring department in his previous two games, so he's more of a deep league guy at the moment.

             Porter expended a ton of energy chasing around Lauri Markkanen on defense, so that can help explain why he was less effective on offense, but he still rounded out his stat line with the steals and 3-point shooting. Owners can expect a more potent offensive stat line from Porter on Wednesday with a matchup against the Knicks.

             Beal was incredible from start to finish in this one, but he was particularly ridiculous through the fourth quarter of action, rocking a 42.1 usage rate while scoring 17 of his 39 points. Beal was seen with a large ice pack on his elbow while on the bench on Thursday, but the heavy minutes and workload suggests that this will be a non-issue moving forward. He could be limited at practice, though.

             Wall was a pest on defense, did a beautiful job of orchestrating the offense, and he also came through in the clutch, scoring all four of Washington’s final four points in the 114-110 win. As a side note, Wall is sending away a career-high 1.0 shot per game, which puts him in a three-way tie with Lonzo Ball and Victor Oladipo for the No. 2 spot in the shot blocking department amongst guards.

             Grant missed all five of his field goal attempts, getting all his points through four trips to the charity stripe, but the main take away here is that when Kris Dunn is active, Grant won't receive enough playing time to make a difference in most leagues.

             Mirotic has been straight ballin' this season, posting in every relevant category with averages of 18.1 points, 7.3 boards, 3.0 triples, 1.3 dimes and just 0.9 turnovers per contest on 50.3% shooting, which has been good enough for top-50 value in 9-cat leagues. His value on the open market is probably at an all-time high right now, so it would make sense for Chicago to try and find a trade partner ahead of the deadline with the team clearly looking to Lauri Markkanen as their future four-man.

             Markkanen fell victim to some vicious defense from Otto Porter, so it’ll be interesting to see if he can bounce-back on Monday with another tough matchup against Portland. Overall, Markkanen’s minutes and production have taken a bit of a hit since Nikola Mirotic got back into the rotation, so Markkanen owners should be rooting for a Mirotic trade.

However, Zach LaVine (knee) is on the cusp of a return, and he could mess with Holiday’s minutes once he’s fully up to speed, so Holiday owners may want to look to sell high before that happens.

             Dunn relentlessly attacked the paint and even threw down a few highlight reel slams, so we'd expect him to play Monday vs. Portland, although it couldn’t hurt for owners to double check on his status ahead of tip-off. As a side note, this was Dunn’s fourth double-double of the year, something he only managed to accomplish once last season, so it’s safe to say he’s enjoyed the move to Chicago.

             There are no guarantees that McRoberts will actually step foot on the court tonight, and even if he does, it'll be in a very limited capacity. Leave him on the wire.

             Jaylen Brown (knee) is back in action today, so the Celtics will go with their standard starting five of Kyrie Irving, Brown, Jayson Tatum, Al Horford and Aron Baynes. Smart takes a slight hit with the move back to the second unit, but he's still worth using in season-long settings.

             It'll be interesting to see if Alex Abrines or Josh Huestis gets the start in Roberson's place tonight, but neither of those guys can be relied upon in fantasy hoops with Russell Westbrook, Carmelo Anthony and Paul George healthy. The Thunder have a Los Angeles back-to-back set coming up, so Roberson should be considered questionable for Wednesday's game against the Lakers.

Andre Roberson (knee) will miss Sunday's game, so Alex Abrines might stick in the starting five, although Abrines isn't a great option with OKC's Big 3 healthy.

             Brown was a full participant during Saturday's practice and said he planned to return to the court for today's matchup with the Nets, so it's not surprising at all to see him active. He only missed two games with the sore knee, so he shouldn't be dealing with any major restrictions, and his return to the court should shift Marcus Smart back to the second unit. Get him active.

             Wiggins was held out of Saturday's practice after spraining his right ankle on Thursday, but it looks like he'll fight through the pain today, and he should be out there for his usual minutes. Jones dislocated his pinky on Thursday but played through it, and we wouldn't expect the injury to greatly hamper his production. Feel free to get these guys active.

             Lance Stephenson has been ballin' as a fill-in starter for Oladipo over the past two games, posting averages of 17.0 points, 12.0 boards, 4.0 assists, 2.0 triples, 1.0 steal and 3.5 turnovers per contest, so he's certainly someone to consider in DFS today. Oladipo still isn't running and hasn't gone through any team drills over the past week, so for now, we'll have to consider him on the doubtful side of the questionable tag for Wednesday's game in Milwaukee.

The Wizards will go with their standard starting five today featuring John Wall, Beal, Otto Porter, Markieff Morris and Marcin Gortat.

             Dunn is expected to start, which should translate to Jerian Grant returning to the second unit, and Grant loses a lot of luster as a potential DFS option when running with the reserves. Dunn shouldn't have any major restrictions considering he only spent one game on the sidelines, so season-long owners can go ahead and get him active, although he's not quite as attractive in daily leagues with a tough matchup against John Wall.

If he's out today, more minutes will fall to Jarell Martin. Stay tuned.

Reggie Bullock and Luke Kennard will both lose value when Bradley is cleared.

             Anderson has some lower back tightness, but barring a setback in warmups, he's expected to play vs. the Lakers. He's been pretty bad in December, averaging 7.3 points, 5.6 rebounds, 1.2 assists and 1.3 triples on 37.5% shooting in that span.

             This is the first we are hearing about his foot injury, but since he's questionable that likely means he's day-to-day. We'll pass along any details when we know more, but expect Chris Paul and Eric Gordon to do the heavy lifting for Houston on offense if Harden can't go.

             Conley has been ramping up his workload recently and was spotted going through a workout on Saturday before the Grizzlies played the Warriors -- he was getting shots up all over the floor and was even sprinting at times. The Grizzlies haven't updated his timetable since they said on Dec. 18 that he'd be out for another couple weeks, but we should have an update from the team on Monday or Tuesday.

He's not expected to have a big role when he's cleared, so he's safe to leave on the wire. We'll change his status from out indefinitely to day-to-day.

""Some nights when he doesn’t play big minutes is because other guys are rolling and some nights it’s because I don’t believe he is playing up to the standard that he set for himself. I want him to feel and realize the difference in those nights as part of his growth.""

Maybe Walton goes back to him again on Sunday vs. the Rockets, but the head coach wasn't ready to commit to that.

             Muscala has missed 27 games in a row for Atlanta, but it sounds like he'll be available on Tuesday against the Suns since he was able to play in a couple of G-League games over the weekend. Even though the Hawks are thin up front with Dewayne Dedmon (leg) still out, Muscala will likely have restrictions this week. Deep-league owners can just keep an eye on him.

             Evans continues to fill up the stat sheet, averaging 26.4 points with 7.4 assists and 6.2 rebounds over his past five outings. He had been battling some soreness in his surgically repaired right knee over the past week, but that hasn't slowed him down. His fantasy owners love his top-50 value, especially since he is easily out-producing his average draft position.

             Green was also able to chip in with eight rebounds, two assists and just one turnover while hitting 6-of-16 from the field. He hasn't been great alongside Marc Gasol, and he wasn't playing terribly well before his injury. At this point he remains useful only in deeper fantasy leagues despite his status in the starting five.

            Marc Gasol rolled up 27 points with six rebounds, two steals and an assist across 28 minutes in Saturday's loss at Golden State.
        
        
             Gasol was a very efficient 10-of-13 from the field, including 4-of-4 from behind the 3-point line. Interim coach J.B. Bickerstaff said the team will not be tanking the rest of the season and Gasol certainly got the memo. The center has six or more rebounds in each of his past 17 contests while posting 10 or more points in 30 consecutive games.

             Harrison slapped the brakes on a season-high four-game streak with double-digit point totals. Despite the fact he is averaging 9.8 points per game over the past five outings, he is shooting just 33.3 percent (17-of-51) from the field during the span. Kobi Simmons is making noise off the bench and coming for Harrison's job in the starting five.

             Those 17 points top his entire NBA career before tonight with 16 points in his previous 99 minutes. For the second game in a row, he was used as a combo guard and he's got to be earning more minutes -- he was the backup PG three and four games ago. After the game, Simmons said the team wants him to be confident on offense, and it's looking like they're getting more comfortable in allowing him to provide scoring. He's on the radar in deep leagues and it doesn't look like it'll be long before he's ahead of Andrew Harrison and Mario Chalmers.

             Durant's offensive production was overshadowed by the return of Stephen Curry (ankle) and his 10 3-pointers. KD won't have to shoulder as much of the load as he did during Curry's 12-game absence, and that's bad news for opposing offenses. That means Durant will be even sharper at the defensive end. Durant suffered a mild right ankle tweak at the end of Friday's game, but showed no ill effects of that situation in this one.

             We'll see what the Grizzlies do on Sunday in a back-to-back set, but it's possible that someone gets a night off. If so, Martin will look to duplicate his career-high 20 points from Wednesday. Leave him on the wire in most leagues until further notice.

             West hit 3-of-5 from the field, as he stepped up offensively and on the glass in the second half with Draymond Green tossed earlier in the game. He will generally play about 12-16 minutes per game and give you a handful of points and rebounds while chipping in with an occasional blocked shot. He remains more of a low-end fantasy asset if you're desperate to make a move in those categories.

The positive is that he shook off a sore left knee to play in a back-to-back situation on Friday and Saturday night. Iggy remains useful only in deeper fantasy formats at this point unless injuries create a larger role.

            Ben Simmons scored six points with six rebounds, six assists, one block and five turnovers in 32 minutes against the Nuggets on Saturday.
        
        
             The Nuggets allowed him to shoot the ball and NBA teams will probably allow that to continue. Before tonight, Simmons was only 5-of-15 on his wide-open shots from beyond 10 feet, so it's not even like Simmons is taking them either. Regardless, he's not going to light it up in scoring, but he'll be a force in the other non-scoring categories.

            Klay Thompson (back) was able to play in Saturday's game against the Grizzlies, and he ended up going for 21 points across 34 minutes.
        
        
             Thompson was dealing with some tightness in his lower back, but it doesn't sound like he was ever in doubt to play. He didn't show any ill effects of the ailment, hitting 8-of-19 from the field, including 5-of-11 from behind the 3-point line. Thompson was also reunited with his splash brother, Steph Curry, who missed the past 12 games due to an ankle injury. The duo combined for 15 triples in the 13-point win.

            Jordan Bell was a perfect 4-for-4 from the field while finishing with 11 points, three rebounds, two assists and a steal and four blocked shots across 19 minutes Saturday against Memphis.
        
        
             Bell was ""overpowered"" by Dwight Howard and the Hornets in Friday's game, according to head coach Steve Kerr. The forward started the third quarter after Draymond Green's first-half ejection, and between his coach's comments and being fired up to start the second half, he took it to a higher level. Green isn't likely to face any type of suspension, so Bell will be right back to the bench next time out. Still, he's a solid option to snap up off the waiver wire if he is still available.

            Robert Covington scored 15 points with 10 rebounds, three assists, two steals and one 3-pointer in 35 minutes against the Nuggets on Saturday.
        
        
             While he did make just 1-of-6 from deep, Covington was back to his old self and did close this game out after not closing out the last two close contests. He had right knee soreness on Christmas and a finger injury on Thursday, but this time he had a game-sealing dunk to earn a huge road win. He has regressed after a unbelievable start, but RoCo should still be a top-50 kind of a player going forward.

            Stephen Curry (ankle) returned to the lineup Saturday against the Grizzlies, posting 38 points. He posted a season-high 10 3-pointers while adding four rebounds and three assists.
        
        
             Originally Curry was supposed to play about four or five short bursts of playing time to get him back into the swing of things. It looks like he's good to go. After missing 11 games he was back out there doing his thing, punishing the Grizzlies as Steph started to quickly make up for lost time. He added four rebounds and three assists and he didn't turn the ball over across his 26 minutes of action.

             Despite fouling out, Holmes gave the 76ers a nice spark in the fourth quarter. He's playing somewhat well and it'll be interesting to see if coach Brett Brown matches him up with Alex Len on Sunday.

             He played OK and he's not going to wow you too often. Johnson will be moving to the bench against the Suns on Sunday.

             Not a bad stat line, but this wasn't a great game from Jokic and it wasn't even against Joel Embiid. Jokic was incredible on his jumpers to start the year, but he's trended down a little on that front. He still turned in a respectable 42.6 eFG% on his jumpers this month while he's cleaned up in the restricted area at 78.8 percent to get him to 49.1 FG% overall in December. Jokic is an offensive superstar and he has plenty of shooters around him for spacing.

The 21-year-old has picked up right where he left off before missing a couple of games due to a toe injury.

             One point on 11 possessions is bad. He lost minutes to Trey Lyles here and he's really had some bad efficiency issues even before this dud. If you have Plumlee and value free throw percentage, you may want to see what else is out there with Plumlee sitting at 38.8 percent on the year. His upside isn't too high anyway.

Lyles puts a nice bow on what was his best month as a pro, averaging 14.6 points, 6.5 boards, 1.4 assists, 0.6 steals, 0.4 blocks and 2.1 treys on 54.3 percent from the field in his previous December outings. He looks like he'll have value in standard leagues until Paul Millsap (wrist) can return.

             Favors was outstanding from the field, hitting 8-of-11 from the field while knocking down 3-of-3 from the free-throw line. He is on a nice little run over the past five games, averaging 16.2 points and 7.8 rebounds during the span while hitting 57.0 percent (31-of-54) of his field-goal attempts. Favors has looked rejuvenated after a couple of games off earlier in the month due to an eye issue and concussion.

             Before the game, Barton said his back still isn't 100 percent and that his back bothers him from time to time. In this loss, Barton did look to be in some discomfort at times, but it may not have been because of his back. He did just drop 28 on Wednesday, and Barton gets a few days off before a game against the Suns on Wednesday.

             It's his fourth 30-point game of his career and it's just one point off his career-high. With coach Mike Malone tightening up his rotation, Murray's playing time is surging with some increased usage, rebounding numbers and even defensive stats lately. The Blue Arrow is paying some serious dividends for his patient fantasy owners and he looks like he's going to be a difference maker going forward.

He is just 26-of-75 (34.7 percent) from the field over his past 12 outings, as his shooting woes are now nearly a month long. It has even spilled over to the free-throw line, where he is shooting just 57.1 percent, on pace for a new career low.

             He misfired on all five of his 3-pointer attempts and was only able to provide fantasy owners with one assist and one rebound. Korver is in the midst of a big-time shooting slump, hitting just 32.2 percent (10-of-31) from the field over his past five games, averaging 5.8 PPG during the span. Unfortunately, he looks to be getting worse, not better. But it's happened before, and he'll scorch the nets for five or six triples soon to snap right back out of it.

             Make it 4-of-4 on productive games without Damian Lillard (hamstring) in the lineup this season. We saw coach Terry Stotts really lean on three-guard lineups with Dame, Napier and C.J. McCollum, so maybe Napier's play right now will help him earn even more minutes once Lillard can return. Most of his value has probably passed here and Lillard has a decent chance to play on Monday. It's not a bad idea to hold him until Dame is officially a go.

             Green was red hot off the bench, especially from the perimeter where he was 4-of-4 from behind the arc. That's nine games with double-digit point totals across 14 outings in the month of December, but this was easily his best game of the month. Every now and then he has a big scoring outing, but quickly fades back to low-end fantasy status. Don't get too excited unless he strings together a few performances like this. That's unlikely.

             It's almost hard to believe that Shabazz Napier has stolen his thunder since Damian Lillard (hamstring) went down last week. Lillard should have a decent chance to play on Monday, but McCollum's fantasy owners are probably a little disappointed after he didn't capitalize, especially after C.J. has usually cleaned up sans Dame. That said, maybe this creates a buy-low opportunity.

He is 0-2 over his past two games on his birthday, last blowing out his candles after a win back on Dec. 30, 2013, as a member of the Miami Heat.

             The Knicks are getting closer to starting Frank Ntilikina, which means Jack's playing time is probably going to be dropping. He's been a fine hold in deeper leagues and even standard-ish formats for his position scarcity.

             Love hit 6-of-16 from the field, including 3-of-10 from behind the 3-point line, and he did not turn the ball over. He was the only Cleveland player with a double-double in a rather sluggish performance in Salt Lake City, something that has happened numerous times over the years for the Cavaliers for whatever reason.

             He just missed yet another 30-20 game following his 32-20 vs. Dallas on Friday. Cousins also just missed a 3-pointer at the end of the game to cost the Pelicans yet another home loss to a non-playoff team -- the Knicks are .500 after the win. The Pelicans have been an offensive powerhouse with their third-ranked points per game, so that's helped both Anthony Davis and Boogie post monster stat lines almost nightly.

             Shockingly, this was the first time he missed a free throw in a game all season as he went 4-of-4 from the line in his previous 523 minutes before tonight. That's actually awesome for his fantasy value because Rondo is historically one of the worst foul-shooting guards in the NBA. Regardless, he's proven to be a somewhat valuable player to own so far this season.

             This was a back-to-back set after Whiteside played just 20 minutes on Friday, so it's nice to see him get close to 30 even with the light Friday. Whiteside did also ditch his knee brace in this game, so the medical staff must have been OK with that. Whiteside now gets a few days off before the Heat play again on Wednesday, so perhaps his minutes can climb over 30 in that one.

             Not only has his efficiency been better, but now Richardson continues to run the offense more and has five-plus dimes in four of his last six. He's upped his steals, blocks and both percentages to go with robust scoring increase, as well. Richardson ends December with averages of 17.4 points, 3.7 boards, 2.7 assists, 1.1 steals, 0.9 blocks and 1.9 treys on 54.6 percent from the field and 88.9 percent from the line in his last 15.

             Besides the obvious uptick in shot attempts, he played with more confidence as a scorer from deep and getting into the paint. Dragic has said he'll have to deal with the pain in his elbow for a while, but he's been too good for too long for him not to learn how to adjust.

             That's just one point off his career-high, which came in another December game against the Magic in 2016. He did look to take a shot to his left eye and face from Jonathon Simmons, but he did stay in the game. Johnson was ridiculous in the third quarter with 22 points in that frame thanks to making 10 consecutive shots. Dion Waiters (ankle) is likely out for at least another week, so Johnson should have some increased value to start 2018.

             The bad news is he missed a clutch 3-pointer down three to potentially cost the Magic. Gordon was on fire in the third quarter and got to the 30-point mark for the game with four minutes left in the third. Gordon did have some soreness in his calf on Thursday, but today's stat line is all you need to see to ease your concerns there. With Nikola Vucevic (hand) out, AG is about to feast.

             The training staff was looking at his left elbow in the fourth quarter, but Payton was fine after that. He's become a much bigger part of the offense since Nikola Vucevic (hand) went down and he's logged at least 36 minutes in three of his last four. Yeah, his free throws are bad at 58.2 percent, but he should fill up the counting stats while  Vucevic is out.

            Andre Drummond filled it up during a 93-79 win over the Spurs on Saturday, scoring 14 points with 21 rebounds, six assists and three steals in 38 minutes.
        
        
             Those boards move him to 15.2 per game, which puts him just behind DeAndre Jordan's 15.3 for the NBA lead.  While the boards are hardly a surprise, Drummond's 3.7 dimes per game more than triple his previous career-high 1.1 per game last year. He's also still shooting a very respectable 62.6 percent from the line, so Drummond really gets a ton of credit for improving two weaknesses.

            Luke Kennard scored a career-high 20 points with one rebound, one assist, three steals and four 3-pointers against the Spurs on Saturday.
        
        
             He smashed his previous career high of 14 points in what was easily his best pro game. Stats aside, Kennard looked the part of an energy bench guy and it's easy to see why he leapfrogged Langston Galloway earlier this year. Stanley Johnson (hip) not playing helped here, so most fantasy owners will want to see Kennard do it again before adding him. The Pistons have three games this coming week.

             He scored 10 of the Pistons' first 24 points as he paced the team with a game-high in scoring. Bullock has fit in quite nicely in the starting lineup, averaging 9.6 points, 2.2 boards, 1.1 assists, 1.2 steals and 1.6 treys over his previous 11 starts. He's still going to have a capped upside, but Bullock is on the radar in deep leagues. Although, Avery Bradley (groin) could be back sooner than expected.

            Anthony Tolliver scored just one point in 27 minutes during a start against the Spurs on Saturday, adding seven rebounds, one assist and two steals.
        
        
             Both Luke Kennard and Reggie Bullock were playing well, so coach Stan Van Gundy just moved Tobias Harris over to the four. Tolliver can't be counted on in most fantasy leagues.

             Coach Stan Van Gundy said he was considering to use Buycks once he got up to speed, and apparently today was the day after playing two minutes in each of the last two. Langston Galloway did slide over to the two because of Stanley Johnson (hip) not playing, so that could have been a factor to use Buycks. Just keep an eye on him in deeper leagues because he has outplayed Galloway lately.

            Langston Galloway did not score with one block in 16 minutes against the Spurs on Saturday.
        
        
             He's had an opportunity with Reggie Jackson (ankle) getting hurt, but Galloway is flopping in a big way. He's made just 16.7 percent from the field over his last five games while not really adding much in the non-scoring stats. Dwight Buycks and Luke Kennard may be pushing Galloway out of the rotation.

             He was looking to distribute the ball more and his dimes would've been higher had his teammates actually made shots. Leonard looked the part of a superstar for most of this week, but he does still have some restrictions. The schedule coming up is not going to be nice to the Spurs with a road-road back-to-back set on Jan. 2-3 and another on Jan. 7-8.  While Leonard has four games this coming week, there's a very good chance he only plays in two or three.

             Coach Gregg Popovich went with a lot of smaller lineups with plenty of Kawhi Leonard at the four, so he didn't turn to Slo Mo too much late in this game. Anderson is coming off a 29-minute, 16-point game on Thursday, and he should have ample opportunity while Rudy Gay (heel) is out for at least two weeks. He's worth owning in standard leagues.

             Coach Gregg Popovich mixed it up today and Green may have had a limit on his minutes. Green played just 22 and 23 minutes in his previous two games, so he's probably not going to be able to match his 27.4 minutes per game that he had before tonight. Kawhi Leonard returning also takes away from his upside, but Green is still a hold in deeper leagues.

             We'll see what ""available"" means in a back-to-back set, but Iguodala looked fine in 28 minutes on Friday.

             Even if he doesn't play, this is awesome news that he even has a chance to be out there. An MRI was negative on his Achilles and he is only day-to-day from his Friday injury.

             The Kings are weird. They played Fox through his quad injury last week and it cost him another injury, and now it sounds like he has a small chance to play after the team said he was going to be re-evaluated in two weeks back on Dec. 22. The good news is that he was running at full speed recently, so he's healing. If he does return, that should take minutes from Frank Mason, Buddy Hield and maybe Bogdan Bogdanovic.

             Leonard was listed as probable for this game, but this game is not in a back-to-back set. He was outstanding on Tuesday for a season-high 21 points, but he was rested on Thursday. He'll have some maintenance days, but Leonard should start to resemble the stud we saw last year as long as he's active.

             The team announced he is ""showing progress to make a return"" from his knee sprain back on Dec. 15. Gobert was expected to miss about one month, so that still seems like it's a possible target. His fantasy owners should keep him stashed while Derrick Favors gets a boost to start 2018.

""We’ll just keep looking at it and try to see,"" Hornacek said. Ntilikina is starting to play a lot better with minutes around 30, so he's looking like someone who should be owned in standard leagues.

             This is great news for the Clippers after Rivers needed help off the court. Achilles strains can really linger and we've seen guys like Mike Conley really struggle with an Achilles strain. Rivers could wind up missing a handful of games, but most of his fantasy owners should still hold him. Milos Teodosic, Lou Williams and Wes Johnson figure to step up while Rivers is out.

If he's out, Josh Huestis could be in the starting lineup after he started the second half on Friday, or Alex Abrines could start after a terrible start to Friday. Carmelo Anthony and Russell Westbrook will be busy.

             His bad fall from Saturday night is going to cost him a week. With him out, the Celtics are probably going to go small a lot, so there could be a few more minutes for the perimeter players and not guys like Daniel Theis.

His return means Terry Rozier, Shane Larkin and maybe Marcus Smart take a minor hit.

Covington's finger injury is to his non-shooting hand, but it's possible it can interfere with his shooting. Plus, he's been limited by a knee injury and playing in altitude won't help either. You'll probably want to start him in season-long leagues, but he's a risky cash play in DFS.

If Wiggy is unable to suit up, Jamal Crawford and Marcus Georges-Hunt would soak up most of the abandoned minutes.

             The first step is Brooklyn considering Okafor ready to play, as Okafor has been a DNP-CD in seven straight games. However, once the team feels he's ready to contribute, the Nets may play the two bigs together. ""(We could play) Jarrett and Okafor together. Put Okafor at the 5,"" said Atkinson. ""Jarrett has already guarded (Kristaps) Porzingis and then offensively, we’ll figure it out. The 4 and 5 here are interchangeable."" Something to keep in mind when Okafor is actually in the rotation.

As far as future plans, Carter says he believes the 2018-19 campaign will be his final season. ""I still say one more year. That is just how I’ve been feeling. It is what it is. One more. I’d like to play one more year. Then, I’d probably just walk away.""

            Coach Jeff Hornacek said he wants the Knicks to shoot more 3-pointers this season.
        
        
             New York is dead last in the NBA in 3-point attempts (21.6 per game) and makes (7.8). They are also the only team that has taken more mid-range shots than 3-pointers. ""Of course I want more,"" Hornacek said. ""We’re not getting many. Some of them we’re passing up. On the break, they got to be able to let them fly."" The eventual return of Tim Hardaway Jr. (leg) will help, but expect Hornacek to encourage Kristaps Porzingis and Courtney Lee to shoot more from downtown in the interim.

Winslow is averaging just 6.6 points and 5.4 rebounds in 22.6 minutes per game this season, rendering him irrelevant in standard-sized leagues.

             All three were expected to miss Saturday's contest, so this is merely confirmation. Johnson made some progress late in the week, but he needs to get some full practices under his belt before he's cleared to return.  Kelly Olynyk and Jordan Mickey will continue to log additional minutes with Johnson sidelined.

Curry's ankle injury is from Dec. 4, and this right ankle is his ""bad"" one compared to his left, so the Warriors were right to take it easy on him. Curry had three re-evaluations and coach Steve Kerr said Curry will ""most likely"" play, so he's not officially ""in"" just yet. Fire him up in your season-long leagues, but you may want to be careful in DFS.

             Yesterday, coach Doc Rivers said he didn't think Griffin was up to speed on conditioning, but you would not know based on his energy tonight. He also made 11-of-12 from the line and a lot of the offense went through him. Griffin said he didn't have any pain in any step in his rehab, so he should be ready to roll going forward. He'll obviously have to stay healthy, but Griffin could be an early-round player going forward. By the way, the Clippers have won two straight and are sitting in the No. 9 spot in the West, so that's also really good news to prevent a possible shutdown.

He should be owned in standard leagues and Blake Griffin returning is possibly a positive for him.

             Iguodala finished with two points, two assists and six rebounds while turning it over twice. He went just 1-of-3 from the field, too, as he certainly wasn't as involved as usual. The team is right back at it on Saturday against the Grizzlies and it wouldn't be shocking to see him limited or even sidelined for the second end of a home-and-home.

             Livington was an efficient 5-of-7 from the field, but he was limited to 23 minutes as he continues to slowly make his way back from a sore right knee. His minutes have increased in each of the three games since he returned on Christmas Day, so he is slowly rounding back into form. Still, Steph Curry (ankle) is nearing a return and that will splash cold water on the already limited fantasy appeal of Livingston.

             West was a very efficient 5-of-7 from the field with just one turnover. It was just his third game with double-digit point totals over the past 20 games, so don't get terribly excited about this performance. He remains more of a low-end fantasy asset if you're desperate for rebounds and occasional blocked shots.

             It was a surprise move for Randle to start and this comes on the same day Walton said Randle was losing minutes because of other guys ""rolling."" Walton also explained his move to start Randle after the game, too. ""We’ve been losing games & Julius has been great for us this whole season, so I wanted to give him a chance in there,"" he said. Despite a slow start tonight, Randle looked good and there's a decent chance he starts Sunday and Monday. He should be owned in standard leagues.

He was focused more on the offensive end in this one, and it also helps that the Hornets had a dominant center in Dwight Howard clearing out KD. He'll have to contend with Marc Gasol and the Grizzlies in Saturday's home game. He did suffer a mild right ankle tweak, but he stayed in he game.

            Lonzo Ball (shoulder) is out for Sunday against the Rockets and Monday against the Wolves.
        
        
             He is expected to be re-evaluated on Sunday, but the team will be holding him out regardless. The Lakers start a homestand on Jan. 5, so consider Ball doubtful to questionable for that one. Jordan Clarkson, Corey Brewer and Josh Hart will be getting some heavy run over the next two.

             Green finished just one bucket shy of a triple-double. He hit 4-of-11 from the field while going 0-of-2 from behind the 3-point line. Green also chipped in with three blocked shots, doing a little bit of everything for his fortunate fantasy owners. The good news is that his recent shoulder injury appears to be in the rear-view mirror.

             Moving to the bench is no big deal with Clarkson basically being in a similar role as fellow LA guard Lou Williams. Clarkson is going to be very busy while Lonzo Ball (shoulder) is out and he'll be playing even more with Kentavious Caldwell-Pope out Sunday and Monday. He'll be a popular DFS play on Sunday against the Rockets.

             Lamb has slowed down since his career-high 32-point performance on Dec. 20, but he has still been pretty productive. He is averaging 11.3 points and 4.5 rebounds over the past four since the big scoring outing. This type of production is a lot more realistic and what to expect. He remains more of a low-end asset in most fantasy formats.

             There was no doubt about Rivers getting an MRI here and early indications are that he's going to miss time. Rivers was on crutches after the game and he needed help off the floor after he suffered the injury. If he's out, Wes Johnson, Jawun Evans and Milos Teodosic may play more minutes.

             It's a little bit of a letdown and he even had to guard Blake Griffin in the post at times. Hart is almost certainly going to get two more starts on Sunday and Monday because Kentavious Caldwell-Pope won't be with the team. He's a possible pickup for the back-to-back set there and maybe he can earn more minutes going forward. He has a lot of ways to get more playing time, too.

             Batum hasn't been his normal self from a fantasy perspective, as he still just doesn't look 100 percent after a preseason elbow delayed the start of his season. He is playing, and he is still chipping in for fantasy owners in multiple categories, just not chipping in at the rate we've seen in previous seasons.

He is averaging 13.3 points and 5.0 rebounds over his past four games to make him a solid play in deeper fantasy leagues, at least until Cody Zeller (knee) is healthy enough to return.

It was easily his best effort on the defensive end of the floor this season. He has 24 steals over his past 14 contests, so that's a category you can rely on Walker to contribute. The blocks, not so much. This was his first game with two swats since Feb. 9 of last season.

             After the game, coach Jay Triano said he went with Booker at the point to finish the game because he just wanted more shooters around him. Triano also said he went back to Booker despite the star guard missing 14 of his first 19 shots, and Booker got hot a personal 9-0 run to help earn his second straight win. He's 2-of-2 on good games since returning from a groin injury, so maybe he'll go back to putting up early-round value.

             Maybe it was the hometown game in Sacramento, but Chriss played with an edge for the second game in a row. Coach Jay Triano went to his starters with eight minutes left in the fourth quarter, which was an uncharacteristic move for most of this month. It's hardly time to say Chriss has arrived, but playing well for two straight is a rare feat for the second-year forward. He's arguably the most annoying player to own in fantasy, but go ahead and give him a very long look because of his terrific upside.

            Marvin Williams was scoreless with six rebounds, an assist, a steal and a blocked shot across 23 minutes in Friday's 111-100 win at Golden State.
        
        
             Williams suffered a finger injury before the holiday break, so the good news is that he was able to play. The bad news is that he looked awful and perhaps the finger is why he attempted just two shots, missing them both. He has top-100 ability for fantasy owners, but he can't have many more games like this.

             He did not close this game out with the Suns going with a no-PG lineup. Coach Jay Triano said he wants shooters out there with Devin Booker, so that's not really great news for Ulis. A lot of things can go wrong for him, so he's really not a hold in shallower leagues.

             Devin Booker returning has really put a dent in Canaan's value because of Booker playing PG, and coach Jay Triano went with Tyler Ulis for most of the fourth. Canaan is trending down, but he's still worth owning in 14-team leagues

             That's his fifth double-double on the year and the Suns now move to 8-0 when Warren scores at least 25 points. Perhaps Warren has missed Devin Booker a little due to some poor shooting lines and he's scored about 20 points per game regardless of Booker being out there, excluding his slow start this season. He should be a mid-round guy going forward.

He took a step back from his last outing, but he still had a pretty solid game. Bogdanovic continues to offer more upside than Buddy Hield at this point and he is worth a look in standard fantasy play since he has logged 29 or more minutes in five straight contests.

He also had a team-best plus-12 rating with just one turnover. There were plenty of positives to take out of this one despite the fact his team lost and his shooting performance was just so-so. He is making the most of the injury De'Aaron Fox (quadriceps).

He was playing well coming into this game and he's played in every game since Dec. 10.

             Hield was moved to the bench before Wednesday's game against the Cavaliers with Frank Mason in the starting five. They won that game, so head coach Dave Joerger stuck with it. Hield hit 4-of-12 from the field, including 2-of-5 from behind the 3-point line, and he finished with a minus-9 rating. He hasn't done much outside of the scoring category so he remains more of a fantasy option for deeper leagues only.

             He had two trip-dubs at NC State and DSJ also made an impressive 8-of-12 from the field in this road win. The Mavs had a franchise record 21 triples during this big road win and someone should tell them that this isn't how you tank with three straight wins. Smith Jr. has his minutes back up to 30 now and he may finally be over this hip injury. It was just a matter of time before he snapped out of his slow start, so maybe he starts rolling now.

            DeMarcus Cousins scored 32 points with 20 rebounds, eight assists, five blocks, two steals, six turnovers and three 3-pointers in a 128-120 loss to the Mavs on Friday.
        
        
             Now that's a stat line. It's another 30-20 for Boogie as he becomes the first player since Kevin Love in 2010-11 to have three 30-20 games in a season -- it's not even January yet. Cousins also had his first five-plus block game since Nov. 25, so that's another nice little bonus here. His upside on a given night is as high as anyone and who cares about turnovers anyway?

He's almost a sell-high player because he's so hot, but either way Holiday looks like a difference maker.

             He was in a lot of pain as he was grabbing his left elbow. Andrew Bogut went for a board and pushed Rivers' arm up, so it pressure on his elbow and shoulder. It looks like he's going to be OK.

             It wasn't a great fantasy line, but the three blocks were a nice surprise. Zach LaVine (knee) is set to begin his six straight days of practice on Saturday, so the time is ticking down on how long Holiday and Denzel Valentine continue to see a big role and healthy amount of minutes. He has some short-term fantasy appeal still, but his days of 30-plus minutes will be coming to an end soon.

             He was awesome and for over a year now he's been very impressive as a ball-handler. Besides the passing, LeVert has scored in double digits for a career-high seven straight games. The Nets offense looked as good as ever early with 16 dimes in the first half with and LeVert posting seven of those for the best dime half of his career. He's locked and loaded as the backup PG and gets wing minutes, so he should be owned in standard leagues while he's going strong.

             Lopez also posted four rebounds with an assist, a steal and just two turnovers while finishing with a plus-5 rating across his 24 minutes. The Bulls have a plethora of big men in the frontcourt, so minutes are rather hard to come by. He isn't exactly a spring chicken, and the team likely wants to evaluate it's younger players a little more. That's bad news for Lopez's fantasy appeal at the moment.

             Joseph is seeing a little extra run at both guard spots, helping to pick up the slack while Victor Oladipo (knee) is on the shelf. It also helped that Bojan Bogdanovic was struggling with his shot. CoJo is averaging 10.0 points and 5.0 rebounds per game over his past two outings.

He has powered down the offense late, averaging just 7.0 PPG over his past seven outings, but he continues to be a decent source of rebounds and steals with a few assists.

             In addition to the poor shooting he was also in foul trouble, which limited his minutes. The Bucks are 9-1 this season when Bledsoe scores 20, but they were able to get the win despite his struggles tonight. This was his first single-digit scoring night since Nov. 18 when he was with the Suns, so look for him to bounce back on Monday against the Raptors.

             Do it, Kenny. Just start Allen already. The rookie had a +17 in the plus-minus stat today while Tyler Zeller was -6. Coach Kenny Atkinson said he was considering a lineup change on Wednesday, but he didn't make a move. It feels like it's time with opposing bigs continuing to put up nice lines against Zeller while Allen is looking more and more polished. If you need a big man with long-term upside, Allen is probably your man and him making 18 of his last 20 free throws is a nice little cherry on top.

             The frontcourt trio of Bojan Bogdanovic, Myles Turner and Thaddeus Young were all struggling with their shot, and Sabonis came on and was a nice shot in the arm for the offense. He hit 6-of-13 from the field, but it was his defense that kept him on the floor. If you need rebounds and blocked shots, Sabonis isn't a bad add in deeper leagues. However, he really needs an injury to Turner or Young to make him a fantasy starter across the board.

             Maybe he stepped out of bounds, but there was no call from the officials and he was able to muscle in a semi-dunk for the big win. He finished with 23 points 12 rebounds, six assists, a steal and a block on 10-of-16 shooting. He's the No. 6 fantasy player in nine-cat leagues this season and could continue to climb the list as long as he can stay healthy.

The good news is he turned it over just once officially, but his several missed shots hurt his team and led to opportunities the other way. It ended a five-game streak with double-digit scoring totals, so chalk it up as one bad game.

             He was fairly quiet for three quarters, but Richardson scoring seven points on three possessions over a 47-second span in the fourth makes this line look pretty good. He hasn't really turned in a bad game in almost three weeks now and his fantasy owners have to be loving his production these days. With Dion Waiters (ankle) banged up and Goran Dragic (elbow) not right, J-Rich looks like a possible early-round player for the foreseeable future.

He played just 18 minutes in his return on Tuesday, but garbage time was a huge factor in this game. Expect him to be closer to 30 on Saturday against the Magic, but his owners will want to make sure he's a go in a back-to-back set.

He is making the most of his opportunity to play big minutes with Victor Oladipo (knee) on the shelf.

             Giannis Antetokounmpo threw down a semi-slam over Westbrook with 0.9 seconds left to win the game, ruining Westbrook's night in the process. It's hard to believe he didn't have a 40-point game until Dec. 29 and it took a sore knee for Paul George to make it happen. Westbrook has scored at least 30 points in three straight games and in five of his last seven games, but is still returning late third-round value, mainly because of his turnover woes. If you don't count them, he jumps up to a top 15 fantasy player.

            Goran Dragic made 3-of-12 from the field for 11 points with four rebounds, five assists and two steals in 23 minutes against the Nets on Friday.
        
        
             He did not play with a sleeve in this game after he ditched it during Tuesday's game. Dragic is in a terrible slump right now and it probably has to do with his shooting elbow, making just 31.1 percent from the field in his last three. He's a buy-low candidate, but it could be a month or so before he starts humming again.

             He continues to log significant minutes next to Hassan Whiteside and that's not likely going to change until James Johnson (ankle) gets back. Coach Erik Spoelstra said he wants to see even more 3-point attempts from Olynyk, too. ""I don't think he's getting enough up,"" he said before the game. KO was 0-of-4 from deep here, but he should still be owned in standard leagues.

            Darren Collison tied a season-high with 30 points while adding five assists, three rebounds, three steals and a blocked shot in Friday's 119-107 road loss against the Bulls.
        
        
             Collison did his best Victor Oladipo (knee) imitation, hitting 12-of-16 from the field whiel going 4-of-6 from behind the 3-point line, and he was all over the court defensively. Oladipo is doubtful to play on Sunday, and is expected to re-evaluated next week. That's good news for the short-term fantasy appeal of Collison and Lance Stephenson, especially as DFS values.

             Paul George was out with a sore knee so we were expecting a lot more from Melo tonight. He just wasn't very active and found himself watching Russell Westbrook, who took 34 shots and scored 40 points for the first time this season. Melo's still worth owning in season-longs (8th-round value) but is a pretty risky DFS play based on his ability to disappear.

             Coach Dwane Casey said he was just ""banged up,"" but didn't offer any details. It sounds like Vanvleet is good to go, although he doesn't have a lot of fantasy appeal in a limited role for the Raptors.

             He got kneed in the thigh in the first half, but was able to start the second half wearing a compression sleeve on his leg, so he should be fine. He's been all over the place this season, but is hot, scoring in double figures in four straight and pulling down 11 rebounds in two of his last three. He's trending up, but just be careful on nights when the Raptors don't play against a traditional center, as he tends to see his minutes limited in those games.

            John Collins hit 3-of-8 shots and 5-of-8 free throws for 11 points, eight rebounds and four blocks in 21 minutes of Friday's 111-98 loss to the Raptors.
        
        
             Collins started another double-digit scoring streak tonight after getting just eight points on Wednesday and should have a lot of opportunity for minutes on Saturday against the Blazers. Collins is a great-looking rookie and is worth holding in most leagues, especially if you need blocks. Once the Hawks fully unleash him, look out.

             It's too bad Prince's big night didn't end with a win, but he was aggressive and in the zone tonight. Prince hadn't scored more than 11 points in his previous four, but hopefully this was the game he needed to get going as the new year approaches. He'll look to keep it going against the Blazers on Saturday. Prince appeared to turn his left ankle in the first quarter and was limping, but it obviously wasn't a problem later in the game.

             Despite the return of Markieff Morris as a starter, Oubre's stayed relevant for most of the season. He's hit double figures in scoring in seven straight games and also produces rebounds steals, threes and the occasional block. He's returning ninth-round value on the season and should be owned in most leagues. He's also getting a little more run with Mike Scott out with for personal reasons.

             This was Green's second game of the season and the first one he's scored in after being signed by the Rockets just after Christmas. He could eat into some of Eric Gordon's minutes, and Gordon was already in a little trouble with Chris Paul returning from his groin injury tonight. There was a lot of garbage time in this one, so we'll need to see Green do this again before getting excited. He failed to score in 11 minutes on Thursday night.

            P.J. Tucker started for Nene (rest), who was starting for Clint Capela (orbital), on Friday but hit just 1-of-5 shots for two points, two rebounds and one assist in 15 minutes of a 121-103 blowout loss to the Wizards.
        
        
             Tucker has been intriguing with Luc Mbah a Mouse hurting, but hasn't really done much with the opportunity. And he hasn't scored more than three points in any of his last four. Leave him on the wire.

            Ryan Anderson hit 3-of-11 shots and 1-of-8 3-pointers for nine points and a season-high 12 rebounds in 32 minutes of Friday's ugly loss to the Wizards.
        
        
             That's the most boards Anderson has had as a Rocket and it's not surprising it happened with Clint Capela on the shelf. The Rockets are suddenly cold, dropping their fifth straight game tonight. This was the only blowout during the losing streak and Chris Paul was back in action tonight. They'll be fine.

Considering his injury history, the Clippers may ease him back over a few games, but obviously get him in your lineup tonight.

             He drove to the basket for a layup and landed hard on his right side. VanVleet did have a limp as he checked out, so perhaps he landed on his knee. If he's limited, that should mean more run for Delon Wright.

             Wright has scored in double figures just three times this season, the last time coming back on Nov. 13, while his season high in rebounds in nine. He's not worth owning in most leagues and would only have real value if Marc Gasol were to suffer an injury. And even then Wright would be shaky given his lengthy injury history. Deyonta Davis loses some appeal here.

             Kris Dunn (knee) was a late scratch, so that explains the move here. Grant is probably going to get some heavy minutes in a great matchup, so he'll have a huge chance to maybe earn more run going forward. Dunn's injury sounds more like a day-to-day thin, so Grant is only a speculative add in deep leagues.

If he's out, Jarell Martin would probably get a ton of minutes with Chandler Parsons out.

             Conley is apparently getting closer to a return from his achilles injury and says that he's been working out two hours a day, while also going through treatment on his heel as he prepares to return to action this season. The Grizzlies are terrible and will be a long shot to make the playoffs, but both Conley and the team appear to be determined for Conley to come back and play a big role. It will be interesting to see what kind of restrictions he has once he finally does play, as he's been out since Nov. 13. Andrew Harrison should continue to start in his place for now.

             He's going to test his hamstring on Saturday, so he'll likely be a game-time call. Shabazz Napier has been going nuts with Lillard in street clothes and it could happen again tomorrow. Lillard was seen getting shots up and playing 1-of-1 against Moe Harkless after Friday's practice, but it remains to be seen if he'll be in the lineup or not tomorrow. If he's out, Napier will be a quality DFS option at a good price.

             He has not played in a week, but Vonleh could be out of the rotation with Zach Collins playing well.

             Miles started for Ibaka in the last game he missed back on Dec. 17, so no surprises here. Miles is probably looking at minutes in the 20s and he should be firing away about 10-14 shots, so he's a possible option as a stream or DFS punt.

             In case you missed it, he's out for his second straight game on Friday, so Lance Stephenson gets another start tonight. Oladipo is dealing with pain, soreness and swelling in his right knee, so it's possible the Pacers just hold him out until all of those issues are gone. Stephenson is worth a look in standard leagues while Cory Joseph and Bojan Bogdanovic are also expected to step up on the wing.

             The good news is that Billy Donovan wants to see how George's knee feels on Saturday before making a decision about Sunday's game, so we should have plenty of notice either way. Donovan has not named a starter in George's place tonight, but it's been Alex Abrines in the past. We'll know for sure who is starting closer to the 8:00 tip.

Tucker should be looking at minutes in the low 30s, so he's worth a look as a stream or DFS punt because of his playing time.

Plus, Chris Paul being back is probably a factor here. With Clint Capela (heel) also out, this certainly puts Tarik Black on the board as a punt and it helps P.J. Tucker a lot because the Rockets can just start Ryan Anderson at the five.

             He was expected to play today or Sunday, so Paul must be feeling well. Perhaps the Rockets folding last night gave him a a little extra motivation. The last time he returned from injury, Paul did have about three games with a minutes limit, but this injury isn't as bad as his knee problem. With him back, Eric Gordon will take a hit while Briante Weber is probably out of the rotation again.RotoGrinders.com Daily Slant: This puts Westbrook head and shoulders above Harden as the top overall play. Paul is a risky DFS option in his first game back - he's not cheap and is expected to be limited to about 25 minutes - so the upside just isn't there. Harden is still definitely in play, but he's more of a pivot off Westbrook at this point. Eric Gordon also suffers as a result. With Ryan Anderson starting at center, he's a much nicer mid-range target.

             This is because of an altercation with a Raptors staff member, but both the staff member and Ibaka have apologized. With  him out tonight, we could see Pascal Siakam get into the starting lineup, or the Raptors did use C.J. Miles in the last game without Ibaka on Dec. 17. Siakam makes sense as a streamer or in DFS while Miles, Norman Powell and even Delon Wright will pick up some extra minutes with the Raptors going smaller.

             He should be back out there after getting the night off on Thursday. Of course, fantasy owners can never truly trust the Spurs on their injury report, but for now expect him to play and log minutes in the mid 20s.

""For me a lot of times we want him running, we want him playing fast, we want him running into screens."" Randle played just 11 minutes on Wednesday and he also played eight minutes against the Rockets in the first game Brook Lopez (ankle) missed on Dec. 20.

Griffin said he hasn't really had any pain through his rehab process, so maybe he gets up to speed somewhat quickly.

""The way that he's playing, it's hard to get him off the floor. But I would like to ideally play him less than he's playing right now, as a rookie, just to keep him healthy throughout the whole season.""

             He has right retrocalcaneal bursitis, which is located behind the heel bone. Gay is going to go through a two-week rehab with rest, and then the Spurs will likely announce an update -- well, hopefully they do. Gay's right heel has bothered him for most of this month, so it's more about wear and tear. Coach Gregg Popovich has been looking for a reason to play Kyle Anderson more, so Anderson looks like a strong pickup in 12-team leagues.

             Fournier played through a right foot issue on Thursday, and coach Frank Vogel said he was a little sore afterwards. He's still fully expected to play on Saturday vs. the Heat, but we'll confirm his status hopefully after the morning shootaround.

             Gordon went through a limited practice on Friday, but it sounds like the Magic were just taking it easy on him after he played 30 minutes Thursday. He looked great with 14 points, seven rebounds, two assists, one block and two triples, and his owners can plan on having him in their lineups.

We should have a thorough update shortly; hopefully, it merely a precautionary move by OKC. The Thunder's next game is Sunday vs. Dallas. Alex Abrines started each of the two games George missed previously. Abrines is averaging 12.8 points and 2.5 rebounds over 31.5 minutes in the four games he's started this season. Russell Westbrook and Carmelo Anthony should also see a spike in usage rate with George out.RotoGrinders.com Daily Slant: With George off the floor this year, Russell Westbrook gets a massive +9.9% bump in usage rate and a healthy +0.09 FPPM differential, while Carmelo Anthony sees a +6.4% usage increase and a huge +0.17 FPPM bump. Both of these two are elite options in any format, while Steven Adams (+2.0% usage bump, +0.02 FPPM) profiles as an elite target on DraftKings.

It was assumed that Sunday was the more likely date, but now it appears CP3 could suit up on Friday night. The Rockets are playing on the back end of a back-to-back and have lost four straight games, so they would obviously love to have Paul back in the lineup. This is shaping up as a game-time decision. Check back later this evening.

             Faried hasn't appeared in a game since December 15th. Coach Malone was brutally honest when asked about the situation: ""Our job is to win games, and we’re winning games right now,"" said Malone. ""Right now, Kenneth is not part of the rotation. Obviously, things change in this business. But why would I play him over Nikola [Jokic] or Trey Lyles with how well they’re playing right now?"" Faried should be left on waivers for now. He needs a trade to resuscitate his fantasy value.

             Gay was seen in a walking boot leaving the arena after Thursday night's victory over the Knicks. Fortunately, the injury is to his right heel, as it was his left Achilles that Gay tore last season. We should have an update by Friday evening. The Spurs next game is Saturday at Detroit and, for now, we'll consider Gay doubtful for that contest. If Gay is unable to suit up on Saturday, Kyle Anderson and Davis Bertans would likely see an uptick in minutes.

            Enes Kanter said that he is unsure if he will opt out of his contract and become an unrestricted free agent this summer.
        
        
             Kanter has a player option worth $18.4 million for the 2018-19 campaign. Heading into this season, it was assumed he'd pick up the option. However, Kanter is currently enjoying his best season as a pro, averaging 13.7 points and 10.3 rebounds, while shooting 59.3 percent from the floor and 88.7 percent from the free-throw stripe.

            The Knicks may consider trading Kyle O'Quinn at the deadline, according to a report in the New York Post.
        
        
             It certainly makes sense for the Knicks to consider moving one of their four centers. With O'Quinn serving as Enes Kanter's backup, Willy Hernangomez has been buried on the bench. Hernangomez, who was named to the All-Rookie team last season, has been a DNP-CD in 11 of the Knicks last 12 games. This is something to keep an eye on over the next six weeks.

             Coach Thibs said Wiggins' injury ""slowed him down,"" but Wiggins was able to play through the pain and finished with 21 points, three rebounds and four treys in 34 minutes. We should have an update on the ankle by Friday afternoon. The Wolves next game is Sunday at Indiana. For now, we'll consider Wiggins questionable for that contest. Jamal Crawford, Marcus Georges-Hunt, and possibly Shabazz Muhammad would see an uptick in minutes if Wiggins is unable to play Sunday.

             The 18-16 Blazers are currently the No. 7 seed in the West and this was McCollum's first 30-point game in December. It's about time, but the fact Damian Lillard was out again with a hamstring injury played a big part in McCollum's coming out party. Despite the fact he hasn't been scoring at will this season, he has hit double figures in all but one of his games. Lillard could be back on Saturday, but McCollum is due to go on a tear, and it may have started tonight.

             It's tough to tell if Napier or Jusuf Nurkic was the bigger hero tonight, but Napier was awesome, scoring 22 of his 23 points in the second half and racking up 15 points in the fourth quarter. He was 0-for-5 for one point before the break, but has been rolling without Lillard in the lineup, scoring at least 14 points in five straight games. He's been really fun over his last five games, but Lillard could be ready for Saturday's game against the Hawks, and once he's back, Napier is going to take a hit, no matter how good he's looked recently.

             Nurkic played most of the fourth quarter with five fouls, but held his own against Embiid. He also got popped on the nose and played with a huge bandage on his face for the second half. Nurkic was struggling coming in and had just four points and five boards in his previous game, but the shot to the nose appeared to wake him up, while he was also fired up about playing against Embiid. If Nurkic was dropped in your league and you need a center, go get him.

             Aminu has been bad - really bad - lately, scoring no more than eight points in his previous four games, although he has had 10 rebounds in two straight games. He's hit just 6-of-28 shots over his last four, which is a big part of the problem, but he also hasn't been involved in the offense. Hopefully Damian Lillard will return from his hamstring injury in time for Saturday's game against the Hawks, as Aminu appears to need him to succeed. If you can hang onto him, do it.

             McConnell got some extra run tonight due to Robert Covington leaving early with a left finger injury.

             The Sixers blew an 18-point lead and were outscored 42-25 in the fourth quarter, as Embiid couldn't do anything inside against Jusuf Nurkic, who played with five fouls for most of the fourth quarter. Embiid was fun to watch tonight, especially with his 3-point shooting, but the fact remains that he was outplayed by Nurkic in the second half. The Sixers play again on Friday night, so there's a decent chance that Embiid could sit that one out, so stay glued to the news feed today.

Given the fact that he's coming off a groin injury, not to mention his inconsistency, more nights of rest are coming for Green, which makes him a tough player to take a waiver-wire flyer on right now.

             Gasol is hot right now after triple-doubling on Saturday and posting double-doubles in his last two games. He's playing like a must-start guy right now, but owners have to pay careful attention to the news feed as Gasol can be rested on any given night. And if you're tired of the uncertainty that comes with owning him (he's missed two of his last 10 games), now looks like a great sell-high opportunity on Gasol.

             Kawhi Leonard (rest) was out tonight so Anderson got the start and scored a season-high 16 points on a perfect night. Leonard has obviously missed a lot of other games this season and Anderson hasn't looked nearly this good in his other 24 starts. And with Leonard due back for the next one, Anderson is not someone who should be targeted on fantasy waiver wires. He hadn't scored more than six points in his previous four games after returning from a knee injury.

             He was iffy for this one, as the Spurs considered giving him a rest, but they shelved Kawhi Leonard instead, allowing Aldridge to feast against the Knicks. Aldridge has scored at least 20 points in four of his last five games, but a day off is likely coming, creating a bit of a headache for his fantasy owners.

             Frankie Smokes missed his first double-double by just one point and the 11 dimes were a career high. He has been rather quiet lately, so it was tough to see tonight's big line coming. However, he's played at least 20 minutes in six straight games and tonight's 32 minutes were also a career high. He's been a tough stash this season, but might be ready to start getting it done after tonight's big game. Just make sure you don't cut someone good in order to pick him up.

             Wow. Yes, Kristaps Porzingis and Enes Kanter were both healthy and effective tonight, but Beasley was a monster off the bench. Beasley had scored 6, 10 and 6 points in each of his three games with Porzingis back in the lineup, but went crazy tonight. He's impossible to trust as long as Porzingis is healthy, but his confidence level is high right now, despite his three quiet games prior to this explosion. He's not a must-own player, or a hot pick up, but if you still have him on your roster from the Porzingis-injury period, he paid dividends tonight. Don't count on him to do it again on Saturday against the Pelicans.

             Porzingis had six blocks against the Pacers back on Nov. 5 and is on a bit of tear in that department, swatting 15 shots over his last four games. He's been healthy over his last five games after missing a couple with a knee injury and should obviously be in all fantasy lineups until further notice. Hopefully the blocked shots will continue, as he's averaging 3.8 blocks and 1.5 3-pointers over his last four games.

But if Brown doesn't play on Sunday night, Rozier should be a popular DFS play once again.

Brown should be back from his sore knee sooner than later, so make sure he's out before you start Smart against the Nets on New Year's Eve.

He's averaging 14.2 points, 4.0 rebounds, 2.8 assists, 0.8 steals, 0.6 blocks and 1.4 3-pointers over his last five games.

            Langston Galloway didn't have much success as the backup point guard on Thursday vs. the Magic, scoring three points on 1-of-9 shots in 16 minutes.
        
        
             Galloway's shot wasn't falling and he didn't get his teammates involved either with one assist. He was a -13 during his time on the floor, while Ish Smith thrived in the starting lineup with 18 points and five dimes in 32 minutes. Galloway doesn't need to be on your radar unless you're in a very deep league.

            Ryan Anderson hit 3-of-7 shots and two 3-pointers for nine points, but also had eight rebounds, one assist, one steal and one block in 40 minutes in Thursday's one-point loss to the Celtics.
        
        
             Anderson's no longer a must-start player with Houston's offense geared around James Harden, Clint Capela (eye) and Chris Paul (when he's healthy), but is playing well after fading hard last week. Anderson is averaging 11.3 points, 7.7 rebounds and 2.0 3-pointers over his last three games. Prior to that, he scored a total of two points in two games, which might have led to him being dropped in your league.

             The Bucks were down 74-54 in the third quarter and Bledsoe was instrumental in helping his team come back for the win. He hit 8-of-8 free throws and committed four turnovers, and is rolling, scoring at least 22 points in four of his last five games. Giannis Antetokounmpo had 22 points and 10 boards, and Khris Middleton and John Henson added 14 in the win.

             Smith was getting to the rim at will tonight and the Magic didn't really have an answer for him as he hit 9-of-18 shots. The problem for Detroit is that they were killed when Smith was off the floor, as Langston Galloway was a -13 in his 16 minutes as the backup PG. Smith did well in this role last season with averages of 12.3 points, 6.3 assists, 3.3 rebounds, 0.8 steals and 0.5 triples in 32 starts, so there's no reason for him to be on the wire with Reggie Jackson (ankle) out for at least six weeks.

             He didn't have a block, nor did he blow up the box score, but he played very well and the Bucks pulled off a big comeback win. Henson's worth owning in most leagues, averaging 11.6 points, 5.8 rebounds and 0.8 blocks over his last five games while shooting 72 percent from the floor.

             He was averaging 4.0 steals in his previous three starts, so the steals weren't a huge surprise. He didn't have it offensively tonight, but the overall numbers were very good, and Jones should be a hot pickup in all leagues with Jeff Teague expected to miss two-to-four weeks with a sprained MCL in his left knee. Go get him.

KAT hasn't missed a game this season and is returning first-round value, despite the fact he rarely posts amazing stat lines. The bottom line is that he delivers almost every night.

             He was 5-of-7 from the field and did an admirable job considering the matchup. Biyombo was only credited with one block, but he altered several other shots and was fantastic for most of the evening. He also knocked down both of his free throws after shooting 57.4% from the line prior to Thursday. With Nikola Vucevic (hand) out until at least mid-February, Biyombo is a solid pickup for owners targeting boards, blocks and FG percentage.

            Aaron Gordon (calf) returned to action in Thursday's 102-89 win over the Pistons, scoring 14 points with seven rebounds, two assists, one block and two triples in 30 minutes.
        
        
             Gordon looked bouncy as ever and Elfrid Payton found him for a sick alley-oop jam in one of the highlights of the night (link below). He did have five turnovers, but Gordon gave the Magic a big lift tonight and it's no coincidence that they were able to snap a nine-game losing streak. Assuming Gordon can stay healthy, he should be able to maintain his top-30 position in standard leagues the rest of the way, especially with Orlando banged up.

             In case you missed it, Lillard wasn't even on the injury report Wednesday, so maybe he suffered a setback or didn't progress as quickly as he was expecting. He did attempt to warm up, so we'll continue to list him as day-to-day. Shabazz Napier is now a really nice streaming option and C.J. McCollum also gets a bump with Lillard out.

            Evan Fournier played through his sore right foot on Thursday vs. the Pistons, scoring 17 points with five assists, three rebounds, two steals and three 3-pointers.
        
        
             He looked healthy and closed this game strong with a huge triple and steal in the final few minutes. Fournier also didn't have any restrictions, playing 33 minutes and hitting 6-of-13 shots and a pair of free throws. Fournier should see a bump in usage rate and touches with Nikola Vucevic (hand) out, so he should have some really nice fantasy value heading into the new year.

             The Blazers took him off the injury report on Wednesday, but put him back on there Thursday morning with a questionable tag. Coach Terry Stotts didn't provide an update, so we won't know more until Lillard goes through warmups.

Thomas wasn't much better, but the Knicks might continue to mix up their lineups depending on the matchups. Neither player is a standard-league asset.

Tony Parker, Danny Green and Pau Gasol are also listed in the first unit. Aldridge gets a bump in value every time Leonard sits, so he'll try to take advantage in a tough matchup vs. Kristaps Porzingis.

             No surprise here. With Teague looking at roughly 2-4 weeks on the shelf, Jones has been a popular waiver-wire pickup and rightly so. He thrived in this role earlier this season with averages of 12.3 points, 1.7 triples, 4.0 rebounds, 6.7 assists, 0.7 blocks and 4.0 steals in three starts, so he has a nice window to produce fantasy value.

Their injury reports are incredibly unreliable, but his fantasy owners already knew that. Expect Kyle Anderson, Rudy Gay and Pau Gasol to be more involved tonight. There's still no word on LaMarcus Aldridge, but Spurs beat reporter Jeff McDonald thinks he will play.

             Because Wilson has been forced to play a bigger than anticipated role for the Clippers early in the season, Los Angeles will have to make a decision on his two-way contract sooner rather than later. ""I’m not going to lie to you,"" he said. ""Some days I wake up and you just don’t know what’s going to happen. Sometimes that can make you timid and kind of put you in a funk. But then you just kind of embrace the moment. Being around these guys, it’s a great feeling."" Doc Rivers admitted that ""it's going to be tough"" when decision day comes, especially since the Clippers don't have real roster flexibility.

            Dwight Buycks, who is on a two-way contract with Detroit, is determined to make an impression on the Pistons.
        
        
             With Reggie Jackson (ankle) sidelined for next six-to-eight weeks, Buycks has an opportunity to show he's worthy of sticking in the NBA. ""This is my dream, to be here and be here permanently,"" he said. ""It’s up to me to put the work in and be successful out here. I’m just happy to be here."" Buycks is unlikely to see an immediate role behind Ish Smith and Langston Galloway, but it's not ludicrous to think he could play his way into the point guard rotation.

             Covington was listed as questionable and was sporting a big wrap around his right knee on Christmas Day, but the soreness doesn't sound like something that will prevent him from suiting up. In other words, it's a situation worth monitoring, not avoiding. However, it is worth noting that RoCo has struggled with his shot this month, connecting on just 36.7% of his attempts.

When Paul is able to get back out there, Eric Gordon will return to the bench.

Everybody needs to understand that he’s [still] a very young player. He looks like a far more comfortable player now than he did at any point last season."" While Hezonja has looked better and has scored in double-digits in five straight outings, this is classic lip service from his head coach. Actions speak louder than words, and the Magic spoke loudly upon declining Hezonja's fourth-year contract option.

            Darius Miller attributed his success this season to the attention DeMarcus Cousins and Anthony Davis demand from the opposition.
        
        
             ""I get a lot of open looks here with all of the attention that our star players bring to themselves,"" Miller said. ""[Davis and Cousins] are two of the best big men in the league. And I’ve known them for a while, so they’re good friends of mine. It’s just always fun to be in an environment like that when you’re trying to play basketball."" Entering Thursday's slate of games, Miller was tied for fifth in the NBA in 3-point field goal percentage at 45.5%

             Whiteside played just 18 minutes in his first game back in action, and Spo is not in a rush to push that number back up in a hurry. ""However he can handle it at the highest pace, he can play,"" Spoelstra said. ""I'm not in a rush."" The Heat have reliable frontcourt depth, and that allows the club to be semi-conservative with how they deploy Whiteside to ensure he stays the floor. For what it's worth, Whiteside did say that his discomfort level is down to a ""one or two,"" and he feels like he could ""play a lot more"" with his recently improved conditioning.

             Lonzo Ball (shoulder) is out for at least another handful of days, so Clarkson will have to navigate through his difficulties on the fly.

""It’s pretty difficult."" Luke Walton wants Clarkson to find a balance between scoring and playmaking, but it's hard to blame JC given the sixth-man role he's been regularly asked to play on this team. ""It definitely has been tough for me these last two games,"" Clarkson added. ""The looks are different but I’m going to get it while this is going on."" Hopefully, Lonzo's absence will be of the short-term variety.

It’s his credit that he’s transitioned into that as far as people prepare for that.""

             Per the T-Wolves, Teague will be ""sidelined indefinitely"" and ""further updates"" will be provided as appropriate, but ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski reports there is ""optimism"" that Teague could return ""within two-to-four weeks."" The good news is it's the least severe MCL sprain possible, the bad news is that Teague could be looking at a four-to-six week absence if the team's optimism proves to be unfounded. Regardless, we should get more clarity on the exact timeline in the coming days. Tyus Jones should be owned in all formats.

             Lillard was completely removed from the injury report prior to Wednesday's limited practice, so the point guard either suffered an aggravation of some kind or the team was simply overly optimistic. Either way, we're going to get another update in a matter of hours, so don't go plugging him in for certain just yet. If he misses an additional game, Shabazz Napier would continue his ride in the starting five.

            Pistons beat writer Rod Beard expects Langston Galloway to play about 20 minutes per game as the backup point guard with Reggie Jackson (ankle) out of the lineup.
        
        
             Galloway has averaged just north of 14.5 minutes per game on the season, so it's logical to expect a bump in playing time with Jackson unavailable for the next six-to-eight weeks. For what it's worth, Beard expects interim starter Ish Smith to play around 28 minutes per contest. As a starter in 2016-17, Smith averaged 29.5 minutes per game. Of the two, Ish is a far better fantasy target while Galloway could get onto the radar as a 3-point specialist.

The second-year man returned from a two-game absence with 23 points, four boards, four assists, a steal, and two blocks in an absurd 44 minutes of action, so he should be good to go moving forward. That being said, Luke Walton may want to consider dialing the playing time back a tad given Ingram had issues with both quads and since he's averaging 38 minutes per game over 10 December contests.

            Steve Kerr expects Stephen Curry (sprained right ankle) to return on Saturday vs. Memphis.
        
        
             Curry has been ruled out of Friday's game vs. Charlotte in the first of a back-to-back set, but Saturday's contest vs. the Grizzlies looks like it will be all systems go. Curry was playing three-on-three in Thursday's practice, and it sounds like it's just a matter of crossing the T's and dotting the I's at this point in the process. With Curry on the brink of a return, Shaun Livingston and Patrick McCaw should resume their typical roles.

            Blake Griffin (left knee MCL sprain) is officially questionable for Friday's game vs. the Lakers.
        
        
             Things have been trending in this direction over the last 24-36 hours, so this is another positive step to getting Griffin back onto the court. At this point, as long as Griffin feels good during shootaround, we're cautiously optimistic that we'll see him vs. the Lakers—and with a minutes limit—on Friday.

            Jeff Teague has been diagnosed with a sprained MCL in his left knee, a source told Jace Frederick of the St. Paul Pioneer Press.
        
        
             This is the first specific diagnosis we've received on Teague's sprained left knee. Additional testing will be performed, but for context, a sprained MCL is the same injury Blake Griffin is currently recovering from. Depending on the severity of his particular injury, Minnesota's starting point guard is likely looking at a four-to-eight week absence. This diagnosis of an MCL sprain has not been confirmed elsewhere, but anyone with Teague on the roster should be preparing for a lengthy absence.

             Kuzma admitted after Wednesday's loss that he was sore, so this isn't a surprising development and we're marking him sidelined as a result. It's also worth noting that Kuz has played at least 34.5 minutes six straight games, including four outings of 40 or more minutes. If Kuzma does miss Friday's matchup, the Lakers would likely slide Larry Nance back into the starting lineup. Luke Walton has shown a real inclination to keep Julius Randle on the bench.

Without Teague available, Tyus Jones will move into the starting lineup while Aaron Brooks continues to watch from the bench.

             D'Angelo does note that Waiters is hopeful it will be less than two weeks, but players are always overly optimistic and Waiters has a very recent history of issues with this ankle. This report obviously rules Waiters out of Friday's game vs. Brooklyn and beyond. We're now expecting the enigmatic guard's return to be measured in weeks, not days. In the interim, Josh Richardson, Tyler Johnson, and Wayne Ellington will continue to benefit.

""He's still got a ways to go before he's able to get back on the court and actually play."" Given Hill is only running, shooting, and lifting weights and not participating in any team activities, we're not expecting him to return to be any kind of fantasy factor. At this time, a return as early as February is conceivable, but he could also be out far longer than that. Given the uncertainty, there's no reason to touch him in any fantasy format.

             Embiid ""looked good"" while practicing fully on Wednesday and it sounds like he hasn't suffered any setbacks, so we expect to see him out there tonight. His status never certain until tip-off, though, and owners should double-check for confirmation after Philly's warmups.

            An MRI on Thursday morning revealed a sprained left knee for Jeff Teague.
        
        
             There's no structural damage which is a relief, but Teague is considered out indefinitely for now. His fantasy owners should sit tight until we get an idea of his timetable, but Tyus Jones will likely start in his absence and is a solid pickup in competitive fantasy leagues. In three starts this season, Jones averaged 12.3 points, 1.7 triples, 4.0 rebounds, 6.7 assists, 0.7 blocks and 4.0 steals.

             Waiters may need surgery in the offseason, but he intends to keep playing through the discomfort this season. He's missed two straight games and probably won't play on Friday vs. the Nets if he's not practicing yet (he's listed as out in the game notes), but he's not a must-own player in 12-team leagues with his fantasy arrow pointing down. Josh Richardson has been a top-25 player for the past month and Wayne Ellington has been awesome lately with 17 triples over his last three games.

As frustrating as this ankle issue has been, his upside is too high to leave on the wire, especially since he's day-to-day.  Kelly Olynyk will continue to benefit in Johnson's absence.

             His timetable hasn't changed, so the Pistons are still hopeful to have him as soon as Jan. 1. With Reggie Jackson (ankle) out at least six weeks, Bradley should have more ball-handling responsibility upon his return, so he's certainly worth stashing. Reggie Bullock will continue to see a nice bump in value while Bradley is out.

             He's looking at a lot of starts going forward, as Reggie Jackson (ankle) won't even be re-evaluated for at least six weeks. Smith did well in 32 starts last season with 12.3 points, 6.3 assists, 3.3 rebounds, 0.8 steals and 0.5 triples, so he's worth picking up in 12-team leagues. Langston Galloway will back him up.

             The Clippers have had one of the best defensive ratings over the last 10 games and Rivers credits Evans for some of the success. ""I think Jawun’s ball pressure has been great,"" Rivers said. ""My entire theory on defense is the more clock you can [make the offense] use before they start, the less time they have to hurt you."" Evans has been more involved lately with so many injuries in Los Angeles, and he's going to be an interesting name to watch down the stretch if the Clippers don't start putting together some wins.

             It's still unclear if his foot soreness is related to his recent ankle sprain. Fournier played 30 minutes on Tuesday and seemed fine, but the Magic will see how he feels in warmups before making a decision. If he can't go, Jonathon Simmons would get a bump and we could see more of Wes Iwundu or Arron Afflalo. It's possible Mario Hezonja slides down a position or two as well with Aaron Gordon (calf) possibly returning.

             Gordon was listed as questionable after going through a full practice on Wednesday, but the Magic probably want to see him go through warmups before making a final call. He's probably closer to probable, and the Magic could certainly use him because they are running out of warm bodies -- Jonathan Isaac is sidelined again with his lingering ankle issue. If Gordon plays, Hezonja would likely move back to the second unit and could lose a lot of value.

He can't catch a break and we expect the Magic to be even more cautious going forward since they are currently third in the lottery. The good news for Orlando is that Aaron Gordon (calf) might be back tonight. Mario Hezonja might be able to stay relevant even with Gordon nearing a return as long as the Magic are so banged up.

             Coach Mike D'Antoni said earlier this week that Paul wouldn't play in both games of the back-to-back set, so it's still possible that CP3 returns on Friday vs. the Wizards. With Paul out Thursday, James Harden will be as busy as ever, Eric Gordon will start and play heavy minutes and Briante Weber could see a handful of minutes off the bench after averaging 17.0 minutes in his last two games.

             ""Very few guys could do that, what he does, be that ignitable,"" Spoelstra said. ""And the level of difficulty on his threes, coming off full speed, stop on a dime and shoot it under the heaviest of duress and pressure and contest — he makes it look easy."" Ellington has made 17 3-pointers over his last three games which is the best stretch of his career, and he's also played 32 or more minutes in five straight games. He's worth owning for his 3-pointers alone and still has a nice window to produce with Dion Waiters (ankle) on the shelf.

             So much for his minutes limit. Ingram matched his season-high of 44 minutes tonight, and while he said he ""felt good mentally and physically,"" he said his quad will likely be sore in the morning. Ingram hit 9-of-20 shots, but his struggles from the line continued (5-of-11). He's worth owning and has been really solid in December, but he's a better fit on fantasy teams that can live with his rough free throw shooting.

             It looked like Kuzma went back to the locker room after he got kneed in the quad area, but he actually stayed in the tunnel and rode the exercise bike to stay loose. He said after the game that he's hurting ""a little bit,"" but it doesn't sound like he's in danger of missing any time. He scored nine points with eight rebounds, one assist, two steals and one triple and he even played some center, but he hit just 4-of-22 shots in what was a rare night for the impressive rookie. Assuming his leg is OK, expect him to bounce back on Friday vs. the Clippers.

             Not good. This time the Lakers went super small late with a frontcourt of Josh Hart, Brandon Ingram and Kyle Kuzma 3-5, which obviously took away from Randle's playing time. That's even more discouraging against a team like the Grizzlies, too. His 11 minutes are the third-lowest total in a game over his career with that eight-minute game against Houston last week as one of the other two. The Lakers center rotation is an absolute mess and Randle is becoming a very annoying player to own, especially with his woeful 65.0 percent from the line. Most owners should still hold him, but we don't blame you if you want to drop him for someone like Tyus Jones.

             Due to Brandon Ingram returning, Hart was in the second unit and checked in for Jordan Clarkson as the backup point guard in the first quarter. Hart continues to log minutes at three positions and he did close this game out as the Lakers went smaller late in the game. He's been a big-time rebounder for a guy his size and he has at least some upside for position flexibility, threes and being in the NBA's fastest unit. He's on the radar in 14-team leagues and climbing to standard territory. He'll probably be starting at shooting guard on Sunday.

             The Warriors are calling the injury a right ankle sprain, but it's expected to be minor and he will not have X-rays. We'll consider him questionable for Friday's game vs. the Hornets, but if he can't go, the Warriors will likely use a committee approach to soak up the few minutes that he does play. He finished with 10 points, four rebounds, two assists and one steal in 15 minutes.

            Tyreke Evans (right knee) looked 100 percent during a 109-99 win over the Lakers on Wednesday, scoring 32 points with seven rebounds, seven assists and two 3-pointers.
        
        
             What knee injury? He cleaned up late with the Lakers fouling him to finish 14-of-15 from the charity stripe. Evans showed up on the injury report and wasn't announced as a starter until about 30 minutes before tip time. He had surgery on this right knee three times over a nine-month span from his Pelican days, but the game serves as evidence that he was listed as questionable as a precaution. The Grizzlies do have a back-to-back on Saturday and Sunday, so his owners will want to make sure he's a go for both of those. He's been quite a story this year.

            Patrick McCaw came off the bench for a season-high 18 points vs. the Jazz on Wednesday, adding four rebounds, one steal and one triple in 20 minutes.
        
        
             He had five points in the fourth quarter, so this wasn't a garbage-time special. McCaw has been more aggressive lately with 10 shot attempts in each of his last two games, but this might be too little, too late with Stephen Curry (ankle) possibly back this weekend.

             He split the PG minutes with Patrick McCaw, but the second-year wing outplayed him with 18 points and four rebounds. Livingston has been banged up lately, so that's why he hasn't played much even with Stephen Curry (ankle) out. Curry could be back this weekend, so fantasy owners in 12-team leagues should be able to find a better option than Livingston.

             The chalk comes through in DFS. Martin was in a huge spot to succeed against a fast, small Lakers team, and with Brandan Wright (quad) and JaMychal Green (knee) out of the lineup. The Grizzlies do have a couple days off, but Martin could be worth a look as a weekend streamer for a road back-to-back in Oakland and Sacramento on Saturday and Sunday. If both J-Myke and Wright are indeed out, fire Martin up again.

             He did suffer what looked like a mild leg tweak in the fourth quarter, but Gasol shook it off and stayed in the game. Gasol has been in the news lately for saying he doesn't have a season to throw away to tank, but the Grizzlies are just 11-24 on the year. Maybe Mike Conley (Achilles) rights the ship, and a win is a win for tonight.

             He was 1-of-7 from the field and was sporting an ice pack on his left knee, but the Warriors were able to rest him with the game over by the third quarter. Iguodala isn't going to be playing much and will have some maintenance days, so he's too hard to trust on a nightly basis.

             Coach Steve Kerr said before the game that Zaza Pachulia would be starting the ""vast majority of games,"" but he also added that he wouldn't hesitate to start Bell in certain matchups. Bell was a top-75 player in standard 9-category leagues over the past month in under 20 minutes per game, so as long as he stays in the rotation and plays a similar amount of minutes or more, his upside is too high to leave on the wire.

             He made his first four shots from the field to help him get to 11 points in the first quarter. Bogdanovic ran the offense for most of his time out there and he matched a career-high four steals on the defensive end. It's possible he moves into the starting lineup again because Frank Mason was starting for the matchup and Buddy Hield has been slightly underwhelming. He offers more upside than Hield right now and is worth a look in standard leagues. Although, this rotation is a mess.

             Mitchell and Thabo Sefolosha were the only starters who played more than 30 minutes due to the lopsided score. Game script doesn't have a real impact on Mitchell, as he's played less than 33 minutes just two times in December. With his bruised toe behind him, Mitchell is locked in as one of the best rookies in fantasy going forward.

Rudy Gobert (knee) is set to be re-evaluated this week, so Favors' window to provide strong fantasy numbers won't stay open forever. Cherish the good times while they last.

             He moved to the bench because coach Dave Joerger wanted to shift Frank Mason to the first unit, but it was a matchup move. Bogdan Bogdanovic was awesome in this game, so Hield getting 24 minutes is a mild positive. Hield is not really doing anything outside of scoring, so he's still not really worth owning in shallower leagues even if he starts next time.

             The Kings went small in the first unit because of the matchups, but it obviously didn't affect WCS and he had a season-high +40.8 net rating in a season-high 36 minutes, too. Cauley-Stein has been a much bigger offensive focal point with a usage rate of at least 20 in five consecutive games. He looks like he could be a must-start player.

             Hood hit 9-of-20 shots and 6-of-8 free throws, but before his fantasy owners get too excited, it's important to note that he scored 14 of his points in garbage time after the Jazz were run out of the building in the third quarter. Tonight's nice line aside, Hood has been a low-end fantasy asset in December because he's only been strong in two categories with 16.8 points and 3.1 triples per game prior to Wednesday. There's room for growth, but staying healthy is the key.

             Yuck. After the game, coach Dave Joerger said starting Mason was a matchup move to take Mason away from matching up against Dwyane Wade -- Joerger almost never does this. You can probably bet Mason will be moving back to the bench here, so his upside may be a little capped even with De'Aaron Fox (quad) out. Tyus Jones is easily a better pickup here.

             Oh hey a triple-double, but he was just 6-of-17 from the field and the Cavs failed to crack 100 for the second straight game -- that didn't happen in November or in pre-Christmas December. Plus, he's actually in a slump for the first time this season by his standards. James did not shoot below 42 percent in any game until Dec. 9 this season, but he's been under 39 in three of his last five outings. He was still able to make 2.4 treys per game and 82.1 percent from the line in those, so he still yielded averages of 25.8 points, 6.8 boards, 10.2 assists, 2.2 steals and 0.6 blocks on 45.6 percent in this five-game ""slump.""

             Even with the game going to overtime, the Nuggets rolled with Jamal Murray for 46 minutes and Will Barton got the backup PG minutes once again. Unless the rotation changes again, Mudiay is safe to drop in re-draft leagues and this will only fuel the trade rumors.

             He's having himself a big season and it'll be interesting to see how he meshes with Isaiah Thomas (hip). Love's usage rate in the fourth quarter is already his lowest of any quarter at 17.9, so chances are it really can't drop much more -- IT was the King of the Fourth last year. He's also been very efficient all season with his 62.4 TS%, so his value isn't on just pure volume anyway. Besides, he was fine next to Kyrie Irving as long as he was able to avoid shooting slumps.

             Hey, two wins in a row against very good playoff teams and he didn't have a triple-double. The Thunder are on a six-game winning streak for the longest active streak in the league and not coincidentally Westbrook is going off, averaging 30.0 points, 10.3 dimes, 8.3 assists, 2.5 steals, 0.5 blocks and 0.7 treys on 56.3 percent from the field and 84.2 percent from the line. This was his 10th 30-point game of the season and his fantasy owners are starting to feel psyched about having him back in MVP form again.

Barton hit 10-of-17 shots with five assists, three rebounds and four 3-pointers, and the Nuggets continued to deploy him as the backup PG and SG even with Emmanuel Mudiay (DNP-CD) healthy.

             The OKC3 of PG-13, Russell Westbrook and Carmelo Anthony combined for 81 points for their highest total together. A light bulb went out during this game and George had an explanation for that. ""We were on fire, the roof was on fire. I think we had something to do with that,"" he said after the game. The OKC offense is really clicking in their last five games with PG averaging 23.6 points, 5.4 boards, 2.6 assists, 2.6 steals, 0.8 blocks and 3.8 treys on 52.1 percent from the field. He's rollin'.

He's part of the team's new identity to take more 3-pointers and Norman Powell hasn't able to build off his strong postseason, so Miles is worth a look in deep leagues as a specialist.

What happened besides those threes? He was also just 2-of-12 on midrange in his back-to-back set and he only made three shots at the rim in these two losses. DeRozan isn't going to be a two-trey guy, but his assists are up and there's little reason to worry here.

             The big story from tonight's game besides Jimmy Butler's offensive explosion was an injury to Jeff Teague's knee. He left the game after 36 minutes of action and never returned, and he's expected to undergo an MRI on Thursday morning. It could be a serious injury, so Jones is worth a long look as a speculative pickup. In three previous starts for Teague, Jones averaged 12.3 points, 1.7 triples, 4.0 rebounds, 6.7 assists, 0.7 blocks and 4.0 steals with just one turnover in that span.

When AD is healthy, he's arguably the best player in fantasy.

             With Karl-Anthony Towns fouling out late in the fourth quarter, it was all Jimmy Buckets in overtime as he scored 12 of Minnesota's 14 points -- that's also a franchise record. His slow start to the season seems like a distant memory, as he's averaging 27.0 points in December compared to 17.9 points in November and 16.2 points in October. He's been the fifth best player in standard leagues over the past month and he'll be even busier on offense if Jeff Teague misses time with his knee injury.

Yeah, the 5.0 turnovers per game over those 12 is rough, but his owners can't really complain too much.

             KAT fouled out late in the fourth quarter which forced him to miss overtime, but Jimmy Butler took care of the rest. Towns posted his league-leading 28th double-double and has 10 blocks over his last three games, so he's averaging just under 2.0 blocks per game in December. The 9-category stud is easily locked into top-10 value as one of the most durable players in the NBA.

             He's the first player to dish out 25 dimes in a game since Jason Kidd since 1996 and he set a franchise record. Most of Rondo's assists were impact dimes with eight of them leading to 3-pointers and nine of them leading to layups or dunks. Rondo's 25th dime was really the only cheap one with an off-target pass to Cheick Diallo, which put him just ahead of his previous career-high 24. He's been better than expected and maybe playing with DeMarcus Cousins helps him now that he's past his prime.

Obviously that's probably the best part of his game, but he's still putting up a steal per night with scoring in the teens. He's coasting as a mid-round guy in standard leagues.

             Lopez didn't eclipse 30 minutes in his previous six games, and that's because the Bulls have a serious logjam up front. He's an obvious trade candidate with the Bulls tanking and they probably want to take a longer look at their younger guys in the new year, so his fantasy arrow is pointing down. If you can get decent value for Lopez in a trade, use tonight's line to your advantage.

            Caris LeVert scored a career-high 22 points during a 128-113 loss to the Pelicans on Wednesday, adding six rebounds, seven assists and three 3-pointers in 32 minutes.
        
        
             This big game isn't really a major surprise to make it six straight games with double-digit scoring for his best streak of his career, and also 11 of his last 12 with multi-category stat lines along the way. LeVert showed flashes as a ball-handler last year, and he's really thrived in this second-unit PG role he's in right now. Coach Kenny Atkinson said a lineup change could be coming, so maybe we see LeVert move into a role like C.J. McCollum as a starter with some minutes staggered away from Spencer Dinwiddie. Either way, it's hard to leave him on the wire in almost any leagues with how consistent he's been this month.

             To his credit, Crazy Eyes made the most of his limited playing time. He was coming off a solid game on Tuesday vs. the Bucks and closed that game alongside Nikola Mirotic, but Robin Lopez got the bulk of the center minutes tonight. There's a good chance that either Mirotic or Lopez is traded, so Portis does have some stash appeal in deeper leagues.

             Nwaba was coming off a pair of nice games and did an admirable job guarding Giannis Antetokounmpo on Tuesday, but he's been inconsistent for his fantasy owners. Coach Fred Hoiberg loves him and he'll find a way to get him around 20 minutes each night, but he has more value in real life than in fantasy. ""You look at what he has done analytically with his plus-minus and his offensive-defensive splits, he’s as good as anybody on our team,"" Hoiberg said.

             Those four treys match his career high to give him an outstanding 112.5 eFG% in this loss. Acy has played more power forward recently because of the loss of Trevor Booker, but it's possible he starts at center with the Nets struggling and coach Kenny Atkinson saying there could be a change coming. Just keep an eye on this situation before Friday.

             Those seven treys are a career high and also matched a franchise record for 3-pointers made off the bench -- Bojan Bogdanovic in 2016 the most recent of the previous four times. Maybe Stauskas can get more consistent minutes and this system fits his style very nicely. Still, you would have to be in a very deep league to roll the dice on Sauce Castillo. There's a small chance he starts, though.

             If the Bulls are tanking, then Mirotic probably didn't get the memo -- they are now 9-2 since he made his season debut. Consistency has never been Mirotic's thing, but he's been tremendous for the most part and his fantasy owners should cut him some slack for tonight's line. He has top-60 value on a per-game basis and his fantasy owners are just hoping that he's not traded to a bad situation.

             According to one of the more plugged-in reporters around Minnesota, there is ""definitely concern"" on Teague. Gary Harris fell into the lateral side of Teague's left knee as it pushed his knee to his right side, and this injury did not look good. Teague did need some help getting off the court and unfortunately it looks like he could miss time here. Fantasy owners in competitive leagues will want to add Tyus Jones right now until we get the results on Teague's MRI.

             He was also going to close this game but he fouled out in the final minute.

It seems like it's just a matter of time before The Frenchise is making starts, but until that happens, fantasy owners can treat him like a stash for his upside in dimes and steals.

He hit just 1-of-6 shots and there's no guarantee that his move to the first unit will be permanent, so this doesn't move the needle much. He is what he is and that's a 3-point specialist in very deep leagues. If he makes more starts and gets hot, we'll let you know about it.

Jarrett Allen supporters have been hoping for a lineup change and it could happen soon with coach Kenny Atkinson saying there could be a change coming to the first unit. Zeller's upside isn't worth owning.

            Dennis Schroder led the Hawks to a 113-99 win over the Wizards on Wednesday, scoring 21 points in 32 minutes.
        
        
             Schroder outplayed John Wall in this one, hitting 7-of-15 shots with seven assists, four rebounds, one steal and one triple. He also looked great on Saturday with a season-high 33 points, four 3-pointers, seven assists, three rebounds and one steal, so it's safe to say his ankle issue is no longer a concern. Schroder and the Hawks will be looking for their third straight win on Friday, but it won't be easy on the road in Toronto.

             Uh oh. After getting ruled out about 100 minutes before Wednesday, the Pacers do it almost two full days ahead of Friday's game. That could mean Oladipo has some swelling and it's also worth a mention they aren't on a back-to-back set on Friday either. Oladipo has been one of the best bargains in fantasy and hopefully this isn't going to linger. Lance Stephenson is worth a look in standard leagues.

             DeAndre Bembry was expected to make a push for Belinelli's minutes, but he's been a DNP-CD in two straight games. We still expect Belinelli to lose some minutes later in the season, but he'll have some low-end value as long as he can hold off Bembry. You have to stream him on the right night though, as he's scored 19, 2, 27, 13 and 3 points in his last five outings.

             He's still splitting the center minutes with Miles Plumlee, but when Dewayne Dedmon (leg) returns, we expect Plumlee to fall out of the rotation completely. Collins hasn't been unleashed yet, but we expect that to happen at some point during the New Year with the Hawks tanking their way to the top of the lottery. He's absolutely worth holding onto.

             Incredibly, this is Atlanta's first two-game winning streak of the season. What isn't surprising is Ilyasova's strong play, as this was his third game in a row with 20+ points and his sixth in December. He'll be a popular name at the trade deadline with his expiring contract, but he's worth owning in standard leagues at the moment as the second or third option in Atlanta's offense.

             It did not look good as Gary Harris fell into his leg. Teague did put some weight on his left foot as he went to the locker room, but he was helped from two team members and he was moving very slowly. Chances are he's going to have to be re-evaluated in the next 24 hours and he could miss time here. Fantasy owners in all competitive leagues may want to add Tyus Jones until we get the all clear on Teague.

             Unlike on Christmas and recently, the Celtics were great in the fourth quarter with a 26-16 edge to get a win. In their last 11, they've ranked 27th in the NBA in fourth-quarter defensive rating, so maybe this game can help them lock down defensively like they were in November. Irving will be fine regardless and maybe the defensive struggles can help his upside.

             He did have his left ankle re-taped in the first half and was able to return fairly quickly. Smart's numbers are slightly better in the starting lineup, but his value depends on if he can make shots. He didn't today, but maybe that'll be different against the Rockets on Thursday. Expect him to start.

            John Wall was quiet in Wednesday's 113-99 loss to the Hawks, scoring 10 points with 11 assists, one rebound and two turnovers in 34 minutes.
        
        
             This was Washington's second bad loss to a non-playoff team in the span of a week after losing to the Nets by 35 points on Dec. 22. Wall was just 3-of-9 from the field and 4-of-7 from the line, and outside of his 21-point, 14-assist game on Christmas day, he's been pretty underwhelming since returning from his knee procedure, averaging 14.0 points, 8.3 assists, 4.3 boards, 1.0 steals and 1.3 triples in his last eight games. Hopefully he's still knocking off the rust and we're confident that he will return to his elite ways soon.

             He was 0-of-3 from deep, which will drop him out of the top spot for 3-point percentage -- George Hill has an edge before he plays tonight. Tatum has opened up some new approaches to offense and he's been very aggressive lately with back-to-back games with six free throw attempts. He's still really only turned in two bad efficiency games in his career, which is just crazy talk. He's incredible.

             After playing just 16.5 minutes per game in November, Powell is flirting with 20 minutes per game in December. With the Mavericks sitting at bottom of the standings out West, we expect Powell's role to continue to grow, making him a potential stash in very deep leagues. Just keep an eye on him.

             Even with injuries to Marcus Morris (knee) and Jaylen Brown (foot), Theis didn't really pick up much run with the Celtics calling on Guerschon Yabusele to fill some rotation time. Theis' upside isn't very appealing while Al Horford is active.

             He was questionable to play due to an illness and his minutes were a shade down from his 27.0 minutes per game average on the season. Kidd-Gilchrist has dropped off this season from his productive 2016-17 with noteworthy drops in points, boards, blocks, steals and free throw percentage. Owners in shallower 10-team leagues can probably do better.

             He's taken a few bumps and bruises in the past couple weeks with injuries to his head and wrist, but Walker has put up some decent stat lines over his last four. Even though the Hornets have lost three of those four, Walker averaged 22.5 points, 2.0 boards, 4.3 assists, 1.5 steals and 3.3 treys on 44.3 percent from the field. The Hornets aren't very good, but Kemba has been as advertised for his fantasy owners.

             Smith didn't fill up the boxscore, but he came up with a huge steal and layup to close this game. He's now scored in single digits in four straight games, but coach Rick Carlisle still showered him with praise after his 8-point effort on Tuesday vs. Toronto. ""Tonight convinced me that this kid is going to be a great player,"" Carlisle said. ""He just really energized the entire team."" DSJ may have hit the rookie wall, but the talent and upside is still there which makes him an obvious buy-low candidate.

He's only getting about eight minutes per game next to Myles Turner over the past five games, so Sabonis really needs an injury to Turner or Thaddeus Young for him to become more than a low-end fantasy asset in 12-team leagues.

            Lance Stephenson posted his first double-double of the season in a start for Victor Oladipo (knee) on Wednesday, scoring 16 points with a season-high 15 rebounds, five assists, two steals and two triples in 36 minutes in a 98-94 loss to Dallas.
        
        
             He did have five turnovers including a costly one in the final minute, but he was terrific for the most part. Stephenson put up 16 points, eight boards, five dimes and two triples in 36 minutes in his only other start of the season, so it's not a surprise that he was productive with Oladipo's 30.8 usage rate on the shelf. Dipo is day-to-day with knee soreness and may have been rested due to the back-to-back set, so there's a good chance Stephenson will reprise his role off the bench on Friday vs. the Bulls. With December averages of 9.2 points, 5.4 rebounds, 2.9 assists and 0.7 steals, Stephenson has proven that he can still provide low-end value when the Pacers are at full strength.

            Myles Turner bounced back nicely on Wednesday vs. Dallas, scoring 16 points (6-of-12 FGs, 3-of-4 FTs) with six rebounds, two blocks, two steals and one triple in 35 minutes.
        
        
             Turner was coming off a rough game on Tuesday vs. Andre Drummond and the Pistons, but he was active early with 11 first quarter points. He eventually cooled off, but he came through for his fantasy owners with the defensive stats like he usually does -- Turner has the highest block percentage (6.7) in the NBA and only Kevin Durant has more total blocks on the season. He's been a top-30 player so far with plenty of room to grow in the new year.

             This comes after a DNP-CD and presumably he starts over Jonas Jerebko. The Jazz will want another perimeter defender out there and Thabo will probably be guarding Kevin Durant. Not much fantasy value shifting here.

             He was doubtful for this one because of a left quad, which isn't the same as his right groin injury. We're going to see a good amount of Jarell Martin while Chandler Parsons figures to get minutes at the four, as well. Deyonta Davis should handle the backup five.

             He had nowhere to go but up after a brutal 5-game stretch with averages of 6.0 points, 5.2 rebounds, 1.8 assists and 0.8 steals. Young's fantasy owners were probably hoping for more with Victor Oladipo (knee) out, but they will live with this line. As cold as he's been, Young's upside in steals alone makes him worth holding onto during the dark times -- he was 13th in the NBA in steals per game (1.71) coming into tonight's game.

             He was questionable and it was somewhat obvious he was going to be a game-time call because this is his bad knee.  If Evans is out, we may see a Kobi go off against the Lakers with Kobi Simmons looking at big minutes.

             This is right on schedule with the Jazz officially announcing Gobert will be updated on the 30th. However, Yahoo! Sports reports that Gobert is going to miss two more weeks from this PCL injury. Derrick Favors will have what should be a couple weeks of strong value, but nobody else is really stepping up.

             ""We have a back-to-back and so that would put him right into a back-to-back situation, which probably is not good for any player coming off [an injury],"" Myers said. ""I don't think Friday is that likely. Saturday? I don't know."" He was doing more on-court work today with lateral movement, sprints and other drives. It sounds like we may get Curry out there on Saturday, but of course the Warriors are in no rush to bring him back.

             He had a big wrap on his right knee down the stretch on Christmas, which led to T.J. McConnell taking his minutes to close the win over the Knicks. Covington did have surgery on his right knee last April, so it's possible he gets a game off to help him heal. If he's limited, McConnell could be getting extra run again, Justin Anderson could be asked to return now that he's healthy again or Timothe Luwawu-Cabarrot may see more run.

He should be good to go for Thursday's game in Portland, and owners can expect to get another update following shootaround.

             Anderson hasn't played since November 15, so he'll likely see a very light workload on Thursday night. He wasn't a huge part of the rotation prior to going down, so his return won't have any major implications in fantasy hoops.

             Revenge game? Thomas has been fairly quiet lately and it's not like McDermott has played dwell either, scoring just five points in 15 minutes on Monday. This is probably more about the matchup than anything else, so there's no move to make in fantasy unless you're desperate.

             This does look to be the big update on Fultz following the report he wasn't feeling soreness in his shoulder back on Dec. 9. The 76ers were criticized for allowing Fultz to play through this injury and you've probably seen him shoot free throws, so they won't be in a rush to bring him back. He's still more of a luxury stash in standard leagues while Dario Saric, T.J. McConnell and Jerryd Bayless continue to benefit.

            The Hawks are hoping Dewayne Dedmon (left tibia stress reaction) can return to games in 10-14 days.
        
        
             This fits with their earlier timetable from this month with Dedmon back in early January. On their update today, they said a CT scan indicated Dedmon's leg is healing as expected, which means he should be able to be back within his 3-6 week timetable from back on Nov. 29. Dedmon's return means Miles Plumlee moves out of the rotation, but John Collins should get minutes regardless.

Terry Rozier should also see an uptick in minutes and usage sans Brown, so he's another low-budget option to think about in daily leagues.

             He's been battling this right knee soreness for a good portion of this month and the Pacers will just hold him out on the second half of a back-to-back set. Oladipo will get Thursday off and hopefully he can make it back to face the Bulls on Friday and Sunday against the Wolves. With him out, Lance Stephenson becomes a very appealing play while Bojan Bogdanovic and Cory Joseph will likely see some added run.

            Aaron Gordon (calf) is being listed as questionable for Thursday's game against the Pistons.
        
        
             Gordon was a full participant at Wednesday's practice, so things are trending in a positive direction here and owners can expect to get another update following Thursday morning's shootaround. If he's able to get back out there, Mario Hezonja would likely head back to the second unit, and his value would take a bit of a hit with the demotion. Stay tuned.

            Jonathan Isaac (ankle) is questionable to face the Pistons on Thursday.
        
        
             He did play 16 minutes on Tuesday in his return to the lineup. Isaac aggravated his ankle last week, so the Magic are likely going to be careful here. Isaac should be able to soak up most of the backup four minutes once he's healthy and perhaps some minutes at the three.

            Evan Fournier (sore right foot) is questionable to play against the Pistons on Thursday.
        
        
             It's possible this foot soreness is related to his right ankle sprain, which he returned from on Tuesday. Fournier looked fine with 30 minutes of action and this injury listing could be a precaution. If he is limited, Jonathon Simmons would be busier while Wes Iwundu or Arron Afflalo would have to step up.

             Stress fractures are really tough to project when it comes to a return date. We've seen Seth Curry (leg) do on-court work for over a month, but he's still not close. The Hawks have said they're hoping Dedmon can make it back in early January, so he may still be on pace for that target. He'll likely have a minutes limit upon his return, so it may be a month or so before he's turning in reliable value.

If he isn't playing, that means big minutes would be going to Jarell Martin.

             He had a right groin injury cost him close to a month, so this may not be related to that. Wright was defending the basket when Tyson Chandler dunked it on him to end the game, so he did finish this game. If he's out, that means we'll see a lot of Jarell Martin and likely plenty of Chandler Parsons at the four, assuming he's a go. Deyonta Davis will likely take the backup center minutes.

Evans may be listed as a precaution, but his fantasy owners are probably going to see him on the injury report from time to time. If he can't go, Kobi Simmons is going to see big minutes after he closed out against the Suns in 26 minutes on Tuesday. He's worth a look in deep leagues while Mario Chalmers would likely enter the rotation again.

With Hassan Whiteside back, Spo may try to tighten up his big rotation with Whiteside, Olynyk and Bam, which means Jordan Mickey could lose some run.

             It was reported on Saturday that Dame was going to be ready to go for this one, and he did play through his injury when he suffered it on Dec. 20. Lillard is one of the more durable superstars in the NBA and hopefully this hamstring strain doesn't linger. His return means Shabazz Napier takes a big hit while Evan Turner, Moe Harkless and Pat Connaughton also lose value.

             Chances are all three will be back with the team for Friday's game. Wilson was on fire in the first quarter on Tuesday to account for 14 of his career-high 17 points. Wilson really hasn't done too much excluding that hot quarter, so he's only worth a look in deep leagues and Blake Griffin (knee) returning would likely cost him playing time.

             He's going to start while Clint Capela (face, heel) is out and it sounds like he can play both Thursday against the Celtics and Friday against the Wizards. Besides Nene, Ryan Anderson will play to play even more while Tarik Black could be an option. If you want to stream Nene on a back-to-back in a deep league, it's not a terrible idea.

            Coach Luke Walton said Brandon Ingram (right quad, left quad) did everything in shootaround this morning and is trending toward playing Wednesday vs. Memphis.
        
        
             Assuming he is a go, he is expected to be on a minutes limit. The Lakers played him a ton of minutes to begin with at about 40 per game before his injury, so maybe they dial him back to closer to 30 once he's back up to speed. Ingram looked to take a knee to his right thigh last Friday and he's dealing with tendinitis with his left, so it's unclear how long he'll have a restriction. His return takes away from Josh Hart, Corey Brewer and maybe Kyle Kuzma's upside isn't quite as high.

            Aaron Gordon (calf) went through a full practice on Wednesday.
        
        
             This is great news and now his availability for Thursday against the Pistons will depend on how he feels tomorrow. Gordon has been out since Dec. 15 with his calf strain, but he he may be between probable and questionable for Thursday. If he is back, that would take minutes from Mario Hezonja while Gordon would be very busy due to the loss of Nikola Vucevic (hand).

             If Griffin responds well to Wednesday's practice, he could be back in action on Friday against the Lakers, so make sure he's not floating around on your waiver wire. Griffin will likely be eased back into things, but he should immediately replace Jamil Wilson in the starting five, and once he's fully up to speed Austin Rivers won't be quite as involved on offense.

             Ish Smith figures to immediately slot into the starting five sans Jackson, and he's worth a look in most leagues considering he put in averages of 12.3 points, 6.3 assists, 0.8 steals and just 1.5 turnovers per game through 32 games as a starter with the Pistons last season. Langston Galloway should also see an uptick in minutes, so he's worth monitoring in deep leagues. Jackson was awful through the month of December, so there's not much incentive to hang onto him in most formats.

             The Celtics were initially calling Brown's injury an ankle sprain, but it sounds like he tweaked his knee as well during Boston's Christmas Day loss to the Wizards. The Celtics are on the road for the first game of a back-to-back set tonight, so Brown's chances of getting out there aren't great, but owners can expect official confirmation on his status closer to tip-off. If he's out, Marcus Smart will start and Terry Rozier will see some increased minutes with the second unit. Stay tuned.

             Griffin has spent the past 13 games on the sidelines, but he looked healthy scrimmaging and throwing down some dunks during Tuesday's practice, so if not Friday, Sunday's game against the Hornets seems like a very realistic return date. Jamil Wilson will return to the second unit upon Griffin's return, and Austin Rivers' won't see quite as much opportunity on the offensive end.

             ‘‘That’s going to really be like his training camp,’’ head coach Fred Hoiberg said. ‘‘But it’s going to be good to get him back for consecutive days of full-contact practice. We’ll see how he responds."" If LaVine can get through this these practices without issue, there's a chance we could see him make his regular-season sometime during the third week of January, so he's close enough to a return that it makes sense to stash him away in most leagues.

""But I won’t write it off, hell no."" Waiters opted to forgo the ankle procedure last summer as it would have cost him 8-10 months on the sidelines, which would have hurt his stock during free agency. For now, he's vowed to continue to fight through the pain, so we'll consider him questionable for Friday's game against the Nets.

We wouldn't expect a sore toe to result in an extended absence for Sabonis, but they might want to hold him out on the second game of a back-to-back set.

             Oladipo's right knee has been an ongoing issue since he bruised it on November 25, although he hasn't actually missed any games because of it, and we'd expect him to continue to fight through the pain tonight. He's likely headed for a game-time call, so owners will need to check back closer to tip-off for the next update. If he is forced to sit this one out, Lance Stephenson, Darren Collison and Myles Turner would be asked to pick up the slack. Stay tuned.

             Capela suffered the injury during the third quarter of Monday's loss to the Thunder via a Steven Adams' elbow, but he had so much adrenaline going, that he didn't even notice the pain until after the game. He'll miss Thursday's game in Boston as well as Friday's game in Washington, which should result in Nene returning to the starting five with Tarik Black backing him up. Capela will need to be fitted with a mask, which can't happen until the swelling goes down, and surgery hasn't officially been ruled out, so his absence could extend beyond this two-game window.

             Yeah, it was garbage time, but Harrell was really into it and enjoyed beating up on the Kings' second unit. His timing isn't the best, as Blake Griffin could return as early as Friday, and Harrell had scored just a total of eight points over his previous two games. As long as Blake Griffin and DeAndre Jordan are playing big roles for the Clippers, it's going to be tough for Harrell to do much on a regular basis. But if you used him in DFS tonight, congratulations are in order.

             Jordan was great while he was out there, but none of the starters from either team were needed much in the fourth quarter of the garbage-time blowout special. This was a nice bounce-back after Jordan scored just four points on Saturday, which snapped his streak of seven straight double-doubles. He started a new streak tonight.

            Jamil Wilson started again on Tuesday and hit 6-of-9 shots and a career-high five 3-pointers for a career-best 17 points, one rebound, two steals and two blocks in just 19 minutes of action in a blowout win over the Kings.
        
        
             Hitting threes is kind of his thing and Wilson has been starting a lot while Danilo Gallinari tries to make his way back from his glute injury. He had scored just three points in each of his previous two games, but has showed signs of a mini-breakout coming. This might have been it, but he's knocked down a 3-pointer in eight straight games and has scored in double figures in four of his last seven. If you're in a deep league with a thin waiver wire, Wilson is at least worth a glimpse.

             Hill played well last Wednesday after missing a game due to an illness, but has not done much in his last two, at least scoring-wise. The Kings aren't very good, but Hill has played pretty well over the second half of December, and while he's currently not scoring much, he's handing out dimes, stealing, blocking and hitting some 3-pointers. Just hang in there with him, especially for as long as De'Aaron Fox is out with his quad injury.

             Tyler Ulis played a little better tonight, but the bigger reason for Canaan's quiet night was the return of Devin Booker, as their franchise player looked as good as ever with 32 points on 21 shots. Canaan was always going to have a hard time holding onto value with the Suns healthy again, but he could still have some value in deeper leagues if he wins his position battle against Ulis.

             With the game tied at 97 and just 0.6 seconds left on the clock, Chandler connected on an alley-oop pass from Dragan Bender on the opposite sideline (link below). It was a brilliant play call by coach Jay Triano and he said he's been waiting 15 years to use it. Nice dunk aside, Chandler was again outplayed by Alex Len (12 points and six rebounds in 30 minutes) and will continue to rest on back-to-back sets, at least while Greg Monroe is still around.

             The Suns were expected to ""keep an eye"" on Booker in his first game back, but he played 34 minutes and looked fantastic -- he hit his first jump-shot 13 seconds into the game and had 20 points by halftime. Booker finished 9-of-21 from the field and 11-of-12 from the line, adding six assists, five rebounds, one steal, three triples and five turnovers. He now gets a couple days off to prepare for Friday's favorable matchup vs. the Kings.

             He was 2-of-3 from the field, 2-of-4 from the line and had five turnovers and four fouls, but this was arguably the most active he's looked all season. Sure he made a lot of mistakes, but the energy and effort hasn't always been there like it was tonight. He's now played well in three out of his last four games, but fantasy owners who want to stash him should be prepared for a bumpy ride.

             Chandler Parsons was rested and JaMychal Green (knee) is still sidelined, so that explains Martin's big night. He had nine points with seven rebounds and a blocked shot in 17 minutes in his previous game, so he could have some low-end value in deeper leagues while the Grizzlies are banged up. They may give him an extended look later in the season as well unless they turn things around.

And while there haven't been any reports of an injury, he just hasn't looked right for the last few weeks.

             Simmons played 25 minutes in his last outing and this confirms that Mario Chalmers (DNP-CD) is officially out of the rotation. With the Grizzlies in 14th place out West and Mike Conley (foot) still without a timetable, there's a really good chance that we'll see a lot more of the rookie going forward. He closed tonight's close game and he's worth monitoring in deeper leagues.

            Mason Plumlee played through a finger injury and made another stat on Tuesday and hit 4-of-6 shots and 1-of-3 free throws for nine points, eight rebounds and three assists in 20 minutes.
        
        
             This game was a blowout, so Plumlee really wasn't needed late. He's not an offensive juggernaut and isn't making his free throws right now, but he is averaging 7.8 points, 8.0 rebounds, 3.2 assists, 1.0 steals and 1.4 blocks over his last five games. If you're thin at center or dealing with a swarm of injuries, Plumlee might be able to help if you can live with the low scoring and poor free throw shooting.

             Hood hit 12-of-24 shots for 29 points last Thursday, but has hit just 7-of-31 shots over his last two games, scoring a total of 19 points. He's rendered Alec Burks useless in his return from an ankle injury, but Hood's shot comes and goes like the wind right now. He'll look to get back on track against the Warriors on Wednesday night, and it could happen, as he was playing very well before this two-game funk.

             Rubio has scored in single digits in three of his last four games and has hit just 8-of-33 shots over that stretch. His turnovers have been better in his last two games, but his overall play this season has not been great. He was on a similar arc last season, but then blew up in the second half, so there's still hope that he can right the ship. But he's simply not a must-start player right now if you have other options available.

             He's now played 30 or more minutes in six straight games, but his production on a healthy Bucks team doesn't jump off the page -- he's averaging 12.0 points, 3.1 rebounds, 1.8 assists, 0.7 blocks, 0.6 steals and 1.2 triples in that span. He's not a sexy fantasy asset, but he's getting the job done if he's the 12th or 13th guy on your roster.

             He didn't have a steal or a block, but it was his highest-scoring game in December and he's now hit double digits in scoring in three straight games. As long as Rudy Gobert is out with his knee injury, Favors should have plenty of opportunities to succeed.

             Bledsoe was 8-of-14 from the field and nailed all three of his free throws, adding six assists, five rebounds, one steal and three 3-pointers. He got off to a slow start following his trade to Milwaukee, but he's meshing really well with his new teammates with December averages of 19.5 points, 4.1 rebounds, 4.0 assists, 1.8 steals and 1.8 triples and is flirting with early-round value in that span.

             Green's really frustrating to own even when he's fully healthy, so he's not someone to mess with if there's a chance he will sit out on any given night. He could get hot and be worth owning again at some point in the near future, but there are other players we'd rather roll the dice on when it comes to fantasy waiver wires right now.

             Gasol had a nice 14-11-10 triple-double on Saturday and has played very well in two straight after sitting out last Thursday. He'll hopefully be safe to play this Thursday and Saturday, but the Spurs have a back-to-back set next Tuesday and Wednesday, meaning he's a strong candidate to sit in one of those games.

             Leonard played a season-high 26 minutes after getting Saturday off for maintenance and finally looked like his old self. We're guessing Leonard is on track to play on Thursday against the Knicks and on Saturday against the Pistons, but the Spurs have a back-to-back set next Tuesday and Wednesday, so he will likely be out for one of those. The minutes are creeping up, but he's still a bit too expensive to be using in DFS right now. But owners in season-long leagues should be using him on nights when he's going to play.

             He came out of the game and went straight to the locker room, and held his ankle a little high when he was down, indicating this could be a high ankle sprain. We should know more on Wednesday, but Harris hasn't scored more than seven points in each of his last three games. If you're holding him, you might be able to do better off the waiver wire.

             As expected, Giannis didn't have any restrictions and will continue to be among the league leaders in minutes. Coach Jason Kidd said there are ""no concerns"" about Giannis' knee and the superstar forward said himself that the Bucks were being cautious by holding him out, but his fantasy owners should get into the habit of checking his status for back-to-back sets going forward just in case -- their next one is on Thursday vs. the Wolves and Friday vs. the Thunder.

LeVert has scored in double figures in 10 of his 12 December games and is generally good for some rebounds, assists, steals and threes, with the occasional block thrown in.

            Jarrett Allen came off the bench and hit 6-of-11 shots for 12 points, nine rebounds and one assist in 21 minutes on Tuesday.
        
        
             The 12 points tied his career high and the nine rebounds set his career high, but he didn't have a block or a steal tonight. He's very intriguing, but the Nets are kind of a mess. Tyler Zeller started at center and had eight points and eight rebounds, and Quincy Acy had eight points, 10 rebounds and two 3-pointers on 3-of-12 shooting off the bench. And Jahlil Okafor didn't play again. Just keep an eye on Allen in case the minutes increase at some point.

             He was 9-of-17 from the field, but his struggles from the line (2-of-4) continued and his ball security (four turnovers) is still a buzzkill. However, he's getting the job done for his fantasy owners with his points, dimes, rebounds and defensive stats, and it's hard to complain about a guy who was more than likely picked up off the wire for free. ""I've been really proud of Kris the way he handled everything and the way he worked to get better,"" coach Fred Hoiberg said. ""He's really taken off in the role. He's the guy we get the ball to in the clutch and he's made big play after big play."" He was ejected in the final minute after getting tangled up with Khris Middleton, but it wasn't anything too serious.

             Carroll got a heavy dose of Kawhi Leonard tonight and didn't fare well. He was playing well prior to this game, scoring between 15 and 20 points in each of his previous three games, and had a strong 20 & 13 double-double on Saturday. He'll look to get back on track against the Pelicans on Wednesday night.

             He had the hot hand tonight, but that's been pretty common these days. Lauri Markkanen was cold with three points on 1-of-7 shots, so Mirotic closed this game beside Bobby Portis. His role has been pretty stable in Chicago's frontcourt, but it's unclear if he's still in their long-term plans -- a report from the Chicago Sun Times indicated that Mirotic is still willing to waive his no-trade clause if he can join a contender.

             Ellington has scored between 13 and 28 points in each of his last three games, knocking down 17 3-pointers in them. And with Dion Waiters out indefinitely with an ankle injury, Ellington is going to continue to see big minutes for the Heat. If you are hurting for 3-pointers, he's worth an add right now.

             Hassan Whiteside was back in the starting lineup but played just 18 minutes, allowing Adebayo to get nice run off the bench. Once Whiteside is back to full strength, Adebayo should take a minutes hit, but he might be able to hold some value for the next few games.

             He stepped on Jonathon Simmons' foot and appeared to badly turn his left ankle, but was right back in the game after a timeout. He's going to get a lot of run with Dion Waiters (ankle) hurting, while Goran Dragic is dealing with a sore left elbow, as well. Johnson is hot, averaging 16.2 points, 5.6 rebounds, 2.8 assists, 1.6 steals and 1.0 3-pointers over his last five, making him worth grabbing if you need a guard. Just make sure his ankle doesn't swell up on Wednesday morning.

             He checked out with 4:37 to go in the third quarter and didn't see the floor again. Nikola Mirotic had the hot hand and Bobby Portis was playing well, so the Bulls rolled with those two guys to close the game. This was a tough matchup for Markkanen, but outside of his 25-point gem on Dec. 21, he's been hard to trust since Mirotic was activated. He's a hold, but his fantasy arrow is pointing down at the moment.

             Dragic was 2-of-12 shooting at one point tonight, but shed his elbow sleeve and played better soon after. Heat reporter Ira Winderman commented on Twitter that his ""left elbow is not right,"" but he did play better after he took the sleeve off. Dragic should be able to play through his elbow issue, but owners will want to keep an eye on his status to make sure it's not going to cost him any time going forward.

             Things weren't looking great for Olynyk a couple days ago with Hassan Whiteside nearing a return and James Johnson back from his ankle injury, but Johnson is hurt again and Whiteside played just 18 minutes tonight. Olynyk is worth owning everywhere right now, at least until Johnson is ready to return from his ankle problem. This was just his second double-double of the season and the 12 boards were a season high.

            Mario Hezonja hit 6-of-12 shots for 14 points, five rebounds and a steal in 32 minutes of Tuesday's ugly loss to the Heat.
        
        
             This could be Hezonja's swan song with Aaron Gordon nearing a return from his calf injury, but he's been playing well for the Magic. He didn't hit a 3-pointer, missing all four of his attempts, but had hit 12 of them in his previous four games. With Evan Fournier back from an ankle sprain and Gordon knocking on the door, owners can expect Hezonja's minutes to take a pretty big hit in the near future.

             Payton is killing it right now after his 30-point, 10-assist game on Saturday, and is averaging 19.2 points, 4.8 rebounds, 7.4 assists and 1.2 steals over his last five games, hitting 61 percent of his shots. He's not a 3-point shooter and usually struggles at the line, but he's filling it up everywhere else.

             Harris outscored the entire Pacers team 21-19 in the first quarter without missing a single shot. He eventually took his foot off the gas, but the game was already over at that point. He added six rebounds with one assist and one steal, and he set a new career-high with seven 3-pointerts. His numbers were down a bit in December prior to tonight, but hopefully this a sign of good things to come in the new year.

             Simmons didn't score until late in the third quarter and simply didn't have it tonight. He had scored in double digits in all of his December games until he had a six-point dud on Dec. 20, and then struggled again tonight. It will be interesting to see how he does now that Evan Fournier is back and Aaron Gordon is close, but Simmons should still be held in most leagues, as tonight just looked like a lost cause for the talented young wing.

             The Mavs went on a 17-0 run starting in the third quarter, but then missed 12 straight shots to keep the Raptors in the game. Barea stepped up with a 12-foot jumper to stop the bleeding and then got to the rack for a nice layup to put the game on ice. Barea has been the most reliable guard in Dallas, averaging 12.8 points, 2.8 rebounds, 7.4 assists, 1.0 steals and 1.8 3-pointers on 48 percent shooting over his last five games.

             Kennard was a +22 during his brief time on the court, so it's unclear why he had such a short leash -- Stanley Johnson was 1-of-8 from the field in 36 minutes off the bench and Langston Galloway had seven points in 19 minutes. Maybe it was a matchup decision or a result of the lopsided score, but Kennard isn't a fantasy pickup anyways with Avery Bradley (groin) due back soon.

He looks good out there, despite the poor shooting, and is still learning how to play NBA point guard. But he's not living up to the lofty expectations that were put on him prior to the season. He just needs to see some shots fall in order to regain some confidence and the six-game injury layoff didn't do him any favors.

             Dirk has scored between 18 and 20 points in his last three and hasn't missed a game yet this season. He's playing well and has been a pleasant fantasy surprise despite his advanced age and mileage.

             This was just his second single-digit scoring night of the season and he finally cooled off from downtown, missing both his attempts after hitting 13-of-20 from deep over his previous three games. He'll look to get back on track against the Thunder on Wednesday.

            Thaddeus Young had another rough game on Tuesday vs. the Pistons, scoring five points on 2-of-4 shooting with two rebounds, one block and one triple in 24 minutes.
        
        
             He was a team-worst -34 during his time on the court and failed to score in double digits for the fourth time in his last five games. He's averaging just 6.0 points, 5.2 rebounds, 1.8 assists and 0.8 steals in that span, so his value has never been lower this season. As bad as he's been, he will be in a prime spot to bounce back on Wednesday vs. Dallas, but he could be a drop candidate if he flops again.

             He was 7-of-8 from the line and committed just one turnover on the night. Lowry is killing it from downtown this season and has shot it well from beyond the arc over his last seven games after going 0-for-8 from deep on Dec. 11. Tonight's loss snapped a six-game winning streak for the Raptors, who lost for just the second time in December.

             After a pair of duds last Wednesday and Thursday, JV had 12 points and six boards on Saturday and was back in form tonight, but hasn't blocked a shot in three straight games. He's as hit-and-miss as they come, but tonight's effort against a weak Dallas center crew should help his confidence. He'll try to keep it rolling against the Thunder on Wednesday night.

             Andre Drummond was a handful all night and had his way with Turner and the rest of Indiana's frontcourt. Turner didn't play in the fourth quarter due to the lopsided score, and this was just his second game of the season without a blocked shot. He was coming off a monster 23-point game on Saturday with nine rebounds, three 3-pointers and a season-high six blocks, but his fantasy owners would like to see more consistency from the big man in the new year. He'll get a much better matchup on Wednesday vs. Dallas.

            X-rays on Reggie Jackson's right ankle came back negative and he has been diagnosed with a sprain.
        
        
             Jackson obviously wasn't able to return to Tuesday's game vs. the Pacers, finishing with eight points, 13 assists and three rebounds. The Pistons didn't provide an update on the severity and we likely won't know more until Wednesday's MRI, but it did look like an injury that will force him to miss some time -- he had to be helped to the locker room and wasn't putting any weight on his right leg. If you need a point guard, Ish Smith is worth a long look in the short term.

Ibaka's having a fine season for the Raptors despite tonight's struggles.

             Jackson has had an up-and-down rookie season, but he did show some improvement over his last two weeks. He's still a major liability in category leagues with his awful shooting percentages, and Booker back in the lineup won't do his fantasy value any favors. He's safe to drop in most re-draft formats, but could be a nice pickup later in the season.

             While he's available, coach Mike Malone hinted that he may be out of the rotation because he likes Will Barton as the backup PG behind Jamal Murray. Mudiay is safe to leave on the wire in most formats.

The Heat are expected to limit Whiteside's minutes over his first few games as he works his way back into shape.

             Adebayo has been very impressive for the Heat, but fantasy owners in re-draft leagues may have to let him go depending on how Hassan Whiteside's knee holds up tonight. Whiteside will have restrictions for a while, so it will be interesting to see how the Heat handle Adebayo's minutes.

Whiteside's return will push Bam Adebayo back to the second unit, but he'll likely be working with a minutes limit in his first game back following a month-long layoff, so he's not someone to target in daily leagues.

Milwaukee may choose to sit him occasionally on back-to-backs going forward, but Giannis will continue to provide first-round value for the remainder of the season.

             Whether or not you can hold onto Vucevic through this injury will depend on whether or not your league offers an IR-spot, and if not, your place in the standings, but we'd recommend trying to hang on to a guy with top-20 upside. In the meantime, Bismack Biyombo figures to enter the starting five, and he should be a solid source of boards, blocks and FG% over the coming weeks, so he's worth grabbing as long as you're okay with some bad free throw shooting.

             Fournier was able to go through parts of shootaround, so while he won't take the court tonight, it looks like there's a chance he could make it back for Thursday's home game against the Pistons. With him unavailable tonight, Wesley Iwundu could be looking at another start and guys like Jonathon Simmons and Mario Hezonja will be asked to do a bit more on the offensive end.

             Both Aaron Gordon (calf) and Evan Fournier (ankle) have been ruled out of Tuesday's contest, so Isaac will provide much-needed depth. However, the Magic will limit Isaac's minutes as he works his way back into shape. Coach Frank Vogel said he will try to keep Isaac to 20 minutes or fewer of game action. Vogel wants to see him guard and ""be himself"" offensively.

However, with Gordon and Nikola Vucevic (hand) watching from the sidelines on Tuesday, Mario Hezonja should get another start and Jonathon Simmons will see an uptick in usage, and both those guys are in play as potential DFS targets.

             Kennard and Tolliver have been moving in and out of the starting five ever since Avery Bradley (groin) went down, but Tolliver tends to see more minutes regardless of how he enters the game. Kennard hasn't done much as of late, so he's not a great target despite the starter designation. Tolliver can be viewed as a low-end, 3-point specialist in deep leagues, but that's about it.

However, he will need to start taking in limited practices first, and then full-contact before he is given clearance. Coach Bud said Dedmon is still in the rehab-only phase. Thus, he still has quite a few hurdles left to clear.

""So we're just monitoring him more, giving him a little bit of time to see how that stress [injury] responds when he puts a little weight on it. So it's a good sign that he's out there doing that."" THJ continues to make progress in his recovery from the stress injury, but he remains without an official return date and the Knicks have yet to disclose whether he's dealing with a stress reaction or stress fracture. He's still not running, so his return to the court should be measured in weeks, not days.

             Brown was forced out of the Celtics' Christmas Day game late in the fourth quarter after tweaking his ankle, and with Wednesday's game being a road game and the first of a back-to-back set, things aren't looking great for Brown getting out there. If Brown is forced to sit, Marcus Smart would likely slide back into the starting five, and Terry Rozier would see an uptick in minutes. Ojeleye's absence would open up some more minutes for Daniel Theis.

            Brook Lopez (right ankle) has shed his walking boot.
        
        
             He's still going to miss at least another two weeks, but this is a small step in the right direction. Andrew Bogut has been starting with Lopez on the sidelines, but he's only getting minutes in the teens and rarely brings any meaningful contributions to the box score. Kyle Kuzma, on the other hand, has been flirting with minutes in the 40s sans Lopez, and he's seen his role on offense greatly expanded. Kuzma is the primary beneficiary here.

             A report from this morning indicated that Griffin would be back within the next two weeks, and it sounds like there's a chance he'll be able to get back out there by the end of this week. He won't play on Tuesday against the Kings, but perhaps he'll be able to get back for either Friday's game against the Lakers or Sunday's game against the Hornets. He'll likely be eased back into things, but once Griffin is fully up to speed, Austin Rivers' usage will take a hit.

""He’s close, I can tell you that,"" Clippers coach Doc Rivers said. ""He’s going to come back probably sooner than later."" If Griffin was dropped in your league, it's time to pick him up.

             Gordon has missed each or Orlando's last four games since straining his right calf ten days ago. Once he's fully healthy and up to speed, Gordon should see increased playing time, along with a spike in his usage rate and fantasy value going forward, as the Magic will be without starting center Nikola Vucevic (hand) for the next 6-8 weeks.

This is obviously terrific news for Whiteside owners; however, check back with us before tipoff to make sure Whiteside avoided any setbacks and is cleared to play. Also, it's probably safe to assume that he'll be on a minutes limit in his first few games back.

            Grizzlies players and coaches have been adamant in their insistence that won't tank this season.
        
        
             ""In our mind, there is no tanking,"" said coach J.B. Bickerstaff. ""We’re competitive. We just need to find a way to get over that hump. We’ve continued to take steps."" Star center Marc Gasol echoed similar sentiments. ""My job is not allowing that to happen,"" Gasol said. ""My job is not allowing anyone to throw away the season. Because at 32, 33 next month, I don’t have a season to throw away."" Gasol's minutes should stay steady for the near future, but it may be a different story in March and April.

            The Warriors may consider trading JaVale McGee, according to Marcus Thompson of The Athletic.
        
        
             McGee is averaging a career low in points (3.7), rebounds (1.9) and minutes (8.1) this season. With Jordan Bell playing well, the Warriors don't have much need for McGee, who would obviously prefer a larger role and a secure spot in the rotation. Milwaukee is one team that is reportedly a possible destination.

He is expected to be back in the lineup on Wednesday when the Grizzlies take on the Lakers. Between his minutes limit and inability to play on consecutive nights, Parson is a headache to own.

Once Miles returns to action, he will eat into the playing time of OG Anunoby and Norman Powell.

Coach Jason Kidd helped to alleviate the concerns of Giannis owners when he told reporters that he has ""no concerns"" about the Greek Freek's knee. Antetokounmpo himself has also downplayed the injury. He should be ready to rock on Tuesday night.

            Jeff Teague hit 3-of-6 shots for just six points on Monday, but also had seven rebounds, 10 assists and two steals in 33 minutes of a 121-104 win over the Lakers.
        
        
             Teague salvaged a nice fantasy line after finishing the first half with zero points and three turnovers. This was Teague's first 10-assist game since back on Dec. 3, and he saw his double-digit scoring streak stopped at six games after tonight's six-point performance. Teague is a sixth-round fantasy player this season and is showing no signs of losing minutes or opportunity to young Tyus Jones. The Wolves have rattled off four straight wins and are 8-4 in December, currently sitting as the No. 4 seed in the West.

             He also hit 5-of-6 free throws and is rounding into form this season. We were expecting a little more against the Lakers tonight, but he's playing well and is the No. 8 player in fantasy this season in nine-cat leagues, according to Basketballmonster.com. He also hasn't missed a single game this season and is shooting 82 percent from the line.

             Gibson is playing well for the Wolves this season and should be owned in all leagues. The TNT crew said he matched his season high with 24 points tonight, but he ended up missing it by one. He shot it lights-out and grabbed a lot of loose balls. Gibson has rendered Gorgui Dieng nearly useless in Minnesota this season.

             The Lakers are electing to start ancient Andrew Bogut over Randle in the absence of Brook Lopez (ankle), but with Bro-Lo, Brandon Ingram (quad) and Lonzo Ball (shoulder) all out, Randle should be getting more minutes sooner than later. If you need a big man, he's worth grabbing if he's on your waiver wire.

             Ingram is day-to-day and if he's out for more games, Hart will make for a nice DFS punt play. He's also worth a look in season-long leagues, but will take a hit once Ingram is back in action. He should also play well on Dec. 31 and Jan. 1 when the Lakers will be without Kentavious Caldwell-Pope in back-to-back road games due to his probation violation. If you want to pick up Bell, now's the right time to do so.

He should play at home vs. Memphis on Wednesday and the Clippers on Friday, but he's expected to miss Dec. 31 at Houston and Jan. 1 at Minnesota after a probation violation. He's a streaky shooter and should get the ship righted soon, but the distraction of his legal mess isn't going to help matters in the short term.

             Clarkson was 0-for-3 from downtown, and while he's struggling from long range these days (2-of-13 over his last five games), he's going to start at point guard for another week and is going to be a hot pickup for as long as Ball is out.

             He hit just 2-of-4 free throws and was pulled after the Rockets turned to a hack-a-Roberson strategy late in the game. His four free throws featured an airball, a clank, a swish and a bank shot, but the good news is that he was able to play through his finger injury. He should be fine for Wednesday's matchup with the Raptors, but his lack of offense makes him nearly unusable except in the deepest of fantasy leagues. He was clutch tonight with his solid defense and blocked a James Harden 3-pointer, finishing with a reverse layup at the other end near the end of a close game.

Gordon had 28 points and six treys on Friday, while Paul shouldn't miss much more time with his injury.

             The previous six meetings between these two teams had been decided by four points or less, so that number will move to five after tonight's matchup. Harden was a beast, but had his shot blocked by Andre Roberson late in the game, which ended up being the difference maker. Neither Harden nor Russell Westbrook triple-doubled tonight, but they both put up big numbers in a great game.

             Capela was iffy due to a heel injury but played well. His missed free throws cost the Rockets late and he didn't have any blocks, but the fact he powered through the injury and played well is Christmas music to his owners' ears.

             Ingram went through an on-court workout before the Lakers determined his status, so it at least sounds like he's close to playing. We'll consider him questionable to return vs. the Clippers on Friday.

             Morris returned from an eight-game absence on Monday, scoring two points on 1-of-7 shooting with four rebounds and one assist in 16 minutes. It sounds like his potential absence on Wednesday and PRP injection were pre-planned possibilities, but we should get some clarity in the next few days. The uncertainty makes him a poor fantasy option, while guys like Aron Baynes, Guerschon Yabusele and Semi Ojeleye will benefit if he misses more time.

             Gortat was coming off a pair of very quiet games, in which he averaged 6.0 points and 5.0 rebounds with zero assists, steals or blocks. Those were both blowouts, though, and his typical role in the 26-30 minute range is good enough for late-round value in most fantasy settings. It helps that he's been one of the most durable players in the NBA throughout his career.

             Porter was averaging 21.5 minutes over the past two games, but that was largely due to lopsided scores -- his recent hip injury isn't an issue and he's back to his stat-stuffing ways. He ranks No. 63 in the NBA's official points-league scoring, but has been a top-25 value in 9-cat leagues this season.

             The Celtics sagged off Wall and let him shoot outside jumpers tonight -- he finished 8-of-19 from the field, and just 2-of-11 outside the restricted area. Nevertheless, Wall fueled a 12-0 run late in the fourth quarter to help the Wizards steal a road win in Boston. His left knee injury is behind him and he's playing without restrictions, so owners can expect elite PG production going forward.

He tweaked his left ankle early last week but that's been a non-issue, so keep him locked into all lineups.

If he misses more time, expect Kelly Olynyk and Jordan Mickey to earn more playing time.

             Assuming his status doesn't miraculously change, Winslow will miss his eighth consecutive game. He exited a game on Dec. 13 with ""tightness"" but the team later called it a strain. An MRI came back negative for structural damage, so we'll continue to treat him as day-to-day.

             Love made 9-of-25 FGs and 7-of-7 FTs tonight. He was once again subbed out on a key defensive possession late in the game tonight, but that backfired with Cleveland giving up a critical offensive rebound. His offensive touches could dip once Isaiah Thomas gets up to speed, but Love is still a safe bet for early-round value -- he doesn't get many headlines in fantasy, but has quietly posted top-20 roto value with just one missed game.

             Smith sat out Thursday's game with left knee soreness, but his quick return suggests that was a simple precaution. He played 31 minutes tonight and his line would have looked better if he'd made any of his four 3-point attempts, but he's simply not a reliable fantasy asset. In addition to awful 38.2% shooting from the field, he's at a career-low 58.8% from the line.

             James hit a pair of 3-pointers but he didn't have any defensive stats, and he also committed a game-high seven turnovers. He didn't get many foul calls down the stretch, which is unusual since he's typically a foul magnet -- he's drawing fouls on 12.7% of his drives this season, which is third-most among the top-50 players (behind Giannis Antetokounmpo and DeMarcus Cousins, just ahead of James Harden).

Jordan Bell has developed nice chemistry with Draymond Green and Golden State's starting unit, and Kerr simply preferred him vs. a Cavs team that likes to go small. Even when he does resume starting, though, Pachulia is nowhere near having standard-league value.

            Jordan Bell had eight points, six boards, three assists, one steal and one block in 26 minutes on Monday, but he's expected to come off the bench vs. the Jazz on Wednesday.
        
        
             Warriors coach Steve Kerr started Bell ahead of Zaza Pachulia tonight because he liked the matchup, but Zaza will resume starting vs. Derrick Favors and Utah. The impressive rookie only needs 20-24 minutes to carve out fantasy value in most leagues, though, so owners should give him a few more games before making any moves.

             Green's efforts helped the Warriors beat the visiting Cavs on Christmas Day, and their 27-7 record puts them 0.5 games ahead of Houston for the best record in the Western Conference. He's flirted with triple-doubles throughout the year and finally broke through tonight -- in the process, he tied the Warriors' franchise record with 20 career triple-doubles. His recent shoulder injury looks like a thing of the past.

             Jack rarely brings anything to the stat sheet outside of the assists category, so while he has some low-end appeal as a dimes specialist in deep leagues, he's not worth owning in most 12-team formats. Frank Ntilikina recorded four points, three assists, two rebounds and one turnover in 27 minutes off the bench, and he figures to overtake Jack for the starting PG spot at some point this season.

             Porzingis locked down the paint and even had a highlight reel swat against Joel Embiid (link below), although he struggled to convert at the line, finishing with an uncharacteristic 9-of-14 effort at the charity stripe. Still, he rounded out his stat line with the elite offering of swats, and we'd expect a more efficient outing on Wednesday in Chicago.

             Kanter is one of the best in the league at attacking the offensive glass with his 16.4 OREB%, and this was just the fifth 30-20 game in NBA Christmas Day history (the last person to do it was Bob Lanier back in 1971). As good as he’s been, it’s possible he could eventually lose some minutes to Willy Hernangomez in New York towards the second half of the season, so owners might want to think about selling high after this monster game.

             Embiid didn’t face much resistance from Enes Kanter, and he really got cooking late in the third and carried that over to the fourth quarter where he posted a 37.2 usage rate. The 76ers are off until Thursday, and Embiid said he just wants to push through this back issue as he doesn’t feel it once he’s playing, so hopefully, he doesn’t need to miss any more time with a sore back.

            Robert Covington struggled with his shot during Monday's win over the Knicks, going 2-of-8 from the field and 3-of-4 from the charity stripe on his way to eight points in 30 minutes.
        
        
             Covington also added one 3-pointer, three rebounds, three assists, one steal, one block and one turnover to his stat line, but he was benched down the stretch in favor of T.J. McConnell and was also spotted with a wrap over his surgically repaired right knee. Hopefully, the knee turns out to be a non-issue, but owners should probably just double-check on his status ahead of Thursday's game in Portland.

             Simmons would have had more dimes if his teammates hadn’t missed so many wide-open looks, but overall he looked a bit passive in his Christmas debut. Still, Philly got the win and we’d expect Simmons to return to his stat sheet stuffing ways on Thursday in Portland.

             Redick had been connecting on just 37.0% of his attempts over the past four games, so it was nice to see him go 6-of-10 from the field and 8-of-8 from the charity stripe for an 88.8 TS%. Additionally, the hamstring was a complete non-issue, so he should be just fine for Thursday’s game in Portland.

             Bell starting over Pachulia could be a matchup-based decision, allowing Bell matchup against Kevin Love and bringing Pachulia off the bench to battle against Tristan Thompson, so it'll be interesting to see how long Bell can hang on to this starting spot with Pachulia back in action. He's got great upside with the defensive stats, so Bell is worth a look in most leagues if you've got someone to cut.

             Morris has had this date circled on his calendar for a while and he said he's looking forward to playing against his brother Markieff. ""This has to be history"" he said. ""First twins to play on Christmas against each other."" He's expected to have restrictions and he's not going to play in back-to-back sets for a while, so he's more of a deep-league pickup. Aron Baynes loses a little bit of appeal with Morris back and Semi Ojeleye (back) could drop out of the rotation.

             He's back after a two-game absence. There's no report of any restrictions, so his fantasy owners can go ahead and plug him back into lineups. He's been fantastic in December, averaging 18.9 points, 3.3 assists, 2.0 rebounds and 2.7 triples. Jerryd Bayless will head back to the bench, while T.J.

             O'Quinn has held off Willy Hernangomez and Joakim Noah for the backup center role, so assuming he's feeling up to it, he should see his normal allotment of minutes in the teens.

             Steve Kerr said this week that there was a ""99.999 percent"" chance Steph would sit out again, so this simply confirms the obvious. He has been increasing his activity lately, but Golden State won't take any chances and owners should consider him questionable for home games on Wednesday (vs. Utah) and Friday (vs. Charlotte). Until he returns, Shaun Livingston, Quinn Cook and Patrick McCaw will continue to hold down the PG spot.

             Obviously, Ball won't be playing on Christmas, and it's somewhat surprising that he's going to miss an entire week considering he was able to play through the injury on Saturday. It'll be interesting to see who Luke Walton brings into the starting five while Ball is on the sidelines, but the decision will likely be between Jordan Clarkson and Josh Hart. Hart is coming off a nice 11-point, 10-board outing, so he's on the radar as a potential speculative add in deep leagues. Even if Clarkson doesn't enter the starting five, he should see more consistent playing time while Ball is out.

            Clint Capela (heel) has been upgraded to questionable for Monday's Christmas Day game against the  Thunder.
        
        
             Capela has missed three of the past four games with this heel issue, and while we might get another update following shootaround, he's likely headed for a game-time decision. If he is able to get back out there, Nene would head back to the bench and Tarik Black could drop from the rotation entirely. If Capela can't suit up, Mike D'Antoni said he'll be ready to go vs. Boston on Thursday.

             Groin injuries can be tricky, and the doubtful tag suggests that the Rockets are leaning towards playing it safe with their 32-year-old point guard, but owners can expect to get another update following Monday morning's shootaround. If CP3 is forced to spend his second straight game on the sidelines, Eric Gordon would have another opportunity to start and James Harden would continue to be ridiculous.

             Thomas will not play on Christmas Day against the Warriors, but he recently got through a full-contact, 5-on-5 practice with the Cavs' G-League affiliate and was going through some 5-on-0 stuff with the Cavs' coaching staff on Sunday. It's also worth noting that Tyronn Lue would not officially rule out IT2 for Wednesday's game against the Kings, which would be the first time that he's not getting ruled out days in advance. He'll assuredly be back within the next couple of weeks.

            The Lakers have reportedly given up on trying to trade Luol Deng.
        
        
             Mitch Kupchak, the Lakers' former GM, awarded Deng a four-year, $72 million contract on his way out there door, and unsurprisingly it's been tough for the Lakers to find anyone willing to deal with this disastrous deal for another two years. That said, the Lakers do need to get Deng off the books prior to free agency in 2018 if they want to have the cap space to be able to pursue the marquee guys, so he will likely be waived at some point this season.

             Booker got through full-contact, 5-on-5 work, so it looks like he'll be back in action following a nine-game absence on Tuesday night, which should result in Josh Jackson returning to the bench. Booker will likely have some sort of minutes limit over his first few games, but as his minutes trend up, Troy Daniels, Josh Jackson and Isaiah Canaan's minutes will start to head in the opposite direction.

             Morris has said many times that he's targeting a return on Christmas, so hopefully he's closer to probable. If Morris is able to go, he'll likely have restrictions and he's not expected to play in back-to-back sets for the foreseeable future. Aron Baynes will lose some minutes when Morris comes back and Semi Ojeleye (back) could fall out of the rotation.

             Barring an official update from the Knicks, we'll consider KOQ questionable for Monday's game vs. the 76ers. If he can't go, it's unclear if the Knicks would roll with Willy Hernangomez or Joakim Noah as their backup center behind Enes Kanter.

             Patton has yet to make his NBA debut after he was recently cleared to play -- he's been nursing a foot injury after undergoing surgery back in July. With Karl-Anthony Towns and Gorgui Dieng in front of him, Patton won't make a fantasy impact any time soon.

Covington is shooting 30.8 percent from the field in his last five games since returning from a two-game absence, but because he fills up the boxscore in other areas, fantasy owners can still deploy him with confidence during shooting slumps.

             Those talks ended when Noel underwent surgery on his thumb, but it's still notable. The Lakers are trying to clear as much cap space as possible to pursue LeBron James and Paul George next summer, and that's why Jordan Clarkson and Luol Deng have been in the rumor mill as well. Randle is a restricted free agent and the Lakers may not have the funds to match opposing offers, while Noel will likely be much cheaper to retain in free agency after a rough season (so far) in Dallas.

             ""They believe they can trade Jordan Clarkson and get his money off,"" Wojnarowski said. ""They prefer not to do it at the trade deadline. Clarkson has helped them win games this year, and because they don’t have their pick, they want to win as many games as they can."" The Lakers have given up hope that they will be able to move Luol Deng, but Clarkson should have some solid value around the league. An in-season trade wouldn't necessarily be a bad thing for his fantasy value as he's only playing 22.1 minutes per game.

""He’s moving well, but it’s a tough situation because I’m not one of the guys that’s going to make the decision on that,"" Suns coach Jay Triano said of Booker's availability. ""And I think we’re going to be cautious more than anything else. With where we are and where he in this franchise history, I think it makes sense to be cautious."" As soon as Booker is cleared, Troy Daniels will lose most of his streaming appeal and there will be less shots to go around for everyone else.

Despite the decent line and solid amount of triples he isn't someone who can be relied upon on a regular basis for fantasy purposes. His production continues to be rather erratic, and he is best left to the waiver wire except in deeper leagues.

            Buddy Hield scored 24 points in a start with eight rebounds, one assist, one block and four 3-pointers during a 108-99 loss to the Spurs on Saturday.
        
        
             This was his first start since Halloween, so this is a noteworthy move from coach Dave Joerger. Plus, Hield went 2-of-2 from the line to mark just the second game over his last eight where he even went to the line at all. Hield has been fairly consistent over his last 10, averaging 15.2 points, 4.2 boards, 1.6 assists, 1.0 steals and 2.5 treys on 47.6 percent from the field. That still makes him only a late-round player, so he needs to up his free throw shooting and non-scoring stats in a big way. He's still an OK hold and it's possible he builds up some momentum while De'Aaron Fox (quad) is out.

            Manu Ginobili finished with 15 points across 21 minutes off the bench in Saturday's 108-99 win at Sacramento.
        
        
             The 40-year-old veteran was able to post the second-highest point total on the team, as he helped pick up the slack with Kawhi Leonard (rest) and Danny Green (quadriceps) out of the lineup. In fact, he is working on a season-high four-game streak with 10 or more points, averaging 12.5 PPG, 3.8 RPG, 2.5 APG and 1.5 SPG during the span. He is still best used only in the deepest of fantasy leagues.

             Forbes was in the starting five with Danny Green (quadriceps) on the shelf and Kawhi Leonard resting, but he didn't do much to pick up the slack. His fantasy appeal will take a hit once Green is healthy enough to play again, not that his value is that great to begin with.

             It's not often both Bogdanovic and Buddy Hield have good games, but it happened tonight thanks to Hield getting the start and the pair logging some minutes together. Bogdanovic likely isn't going to get fully unleashed for a little while, but it's very encouraging to see him play in at least 29 minutes in six of his last seven outings. Plus, his stat lines have been based more on just scoring, so he's only a borderline stash.

             Parker did a good job hitting 5-of-11 from the floor while posting a plus-4 rating, as the Spurs topped the Kings for the 11th straight time. While he will take off occasionally, especially in back-to-back situations, he has scored double-digit point totals in each of his past three. He remains effective for fantasy owners in deeper leagues. The team's next back-to-back situation is Jan. 2-3.

            Shabazz Napier brought it again during a 95-92 win over the Lakers on Saturday, scoring a season-high 21 points with three rebounds, five assists, three steals and four 3-pointers in 35 minutes.
        
        
             He probably won a lot of fantasy matchups with his play this week thanks to this one and a strong 14-point stat line on Friday. The Blazers are also doing a lot of winning against the Lakers with 14 consecutive wins against them. Napier has really played well this week with at least 14 points in four straight games, including two with Damian Lillard (hamstring). However, Lillard is fully expected to play in their next game on Thursday, so Napier's fantasy value will likely be taking a hit. Props to anyone who added for the weekend, but it may be time to cut him in 14-team leagues. This blurb analysis is brought to you by the number 14.

             Aldridge was a very efficient 13-of-22 from the field while hitting 2-of-3 from behind the arc. The double-double was his second over the past five games, and the 13 field goals made tied his most on the road this season. After a season-low 11 points last time out in Utah he stayed out of foul trouble in this one and had his most productive game in the month of December.

Davis showed up to camp in the best shape of his life -- #TheBestShapeOfHisLife -- and it's showing on the court. He doesn't really have much value, but Nurk's owners probably don't like Boss Davis sucking so much value out of this rotation.

             Yeah, he probably burned you in DFS and he did so in a favorable matchup against the up-tempo Lakers. Damian Lillard (hamstring) said he'll be ready for the next one on Thursday, so McCollum will go back to his usual role as the secondary ball-handler. He's been a slight disappointment so far this season, but his owners can't complain too much with his top-50 value in standard leagues. He's also run more miles per game in NBA games than anyone else this season.

             It's winter and Al-Farouq's fantasy value needs another blanket because it's cold. Over his last five games, he's averaged just 6.2 points, 6.2 boards, 1.2 blocks, 1.2 steals and 1.4 treys on 27.9 percent from the field. His defensive stats are his saving grace here, so we still consider Aminu a strong hold in all standard leagues.

             He played really well and played a lot of center in this game. Perhaps one of the more underrated attributes on bench players is guys who play two positions, and Collins has established he can be a four or a five off the bench. He's coming off a 10-point game on Friday and he seems to be picking up steam. However, betting on him means you're betting against Jusuf Nurkic, so don't expect Collins to be over 20 minutes too often.

             After getting tied up with Jusuf Nurkic near the end of the first half, he did suffer a left shoulder contusion and went to the locker room with less than a minutes left in the second. Ball returned to start the second half and didn't have any noticeable discomfort or any tape. Besides his awful foul shooting, Lonzo is starting to look like a fantasy asset over his last six with averages of 16.0 points, 7.3 boards, 7.2 assists, 1.3 steals, 1.2 blocks and 3.0 treys on 44.3 percent from the field. If you're putting free throws, you might just be a Big Baller.

            Julius Randle scored 16 points with nine rebounds, one assist and one turnover in 23 minutes against the Blazers on Saturday.
        
        
             Coach Luke Walton talked a lot about smaller lineups before the Houston game, so maybe he just meant that game alone and that's why he played just eight minutes on Wednesday. Randle now has two solid games in a row with a 21-point, 10-board game on Friday, and he will go against bigger lineups in each of his next three games. He looks like a strong hold and could even trend up with Brandon Ingram (left quad, right quad), assuming he improves on free throws.

             Uh oh. It's looking like Nance could be a matchup piece against teams like the Rockets because he's played just 22 minutes over his last two games combined. Nance does have a four-game week coming up, but he's a possible drop candidate with his minutes getting cut in a big way. He may only need 20 minutes to post value, so you may only want to cut him for a proven guy or Bismack Biyombo.

             He played some strong defense, he's showing he's a solid rebounder, and it's becoming more clear that coach Luke Walton trusts him. Hart has really three things that could happen to help boost his value: Brandon Ingram (left quad, right quad) could miss more time, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope will miss two more games in the next 10 days, and Jordan Clarkson could be on the block. He's on the radar in deep leagues.

In that span, Jokic and Mason Plumlee have been terrific together with a +25.5 net rating at 16.5 minutes per game over those three.

Most importantly, Murray is 33-of-63 from deep this month (52.4%, 2.8 makes per game), adding averages of 17.7 points, 3.4 boards, 2.9 assists, 1.3 steals and 1.6 turnovers.

It would be nice if he did more on defense, but Lyles has been a mid-round guy this month. He's a decent hold until he falls off or until Paul Millsap (wrist) comes back.

             Thornwell was nailed to the bench, as C.J. Williams continues to start at shooting guard and Lou Williams thrives off the bench. He might sniff the court when Milos Teodosic needs a rest in back-to-back situations, but that won't happen again until Jan. 10-11. Nothing to see here from a fantasy perspective.

             He had multiple treys in each of his previous eight games, but he missed all five from deep tonight. Durant may be as cold as he's ever been as a Warriors, failing to shoot over 45 percent from the field for four consecutive games. There's obviously nothing to worry about here with KD being one of the most consistent scorers in NBA history. He'll get a showdown against the other consistent guy in LeBron James on Christmas.

             ""If I’m open and it’s my shot, I’m going to shoot it,"" Butler said this week. ""If it’s not, I’m going to pass it. I have just as much faith in my teammates as I do myself."" Jimmy Buckets called his own number more often than not tonight, but he still added three assists with six rebounds, one block and just one turnover. After a relatively quiet start with the Wolves, Butler is asserting himself while playing enormous minutes -- as a result, he's been a top-10 fantasy player for the past six weeks.

            Andrew Wiggins scored 17 points on 17 shot attempts vs. Phoenix on Saturday, making eight of his attempts with one 3-pointer, four rebounds and one steal in 31 minutes.
        
        
             Wiggins didn't have any assists or blocks tonight, but his owners are used to hollow lines. He also went without a free throw attempt for the second time this season, in what has become a curious trend. Wiggins averaged 7.0 free throws in October, 4.7 in November, and he's down to just 3.4 attempts in December. He might be less aggressive trying to draw fouls, which wouldn't bother fantasy owners since he's shooting an abysmal, career-low 63.0% from the line. It's something Wiggins' fantasy owners should monitor in the coming weeks.

             Before the game, coach Steve Kerr said Zaza Pachulia (shoulder) would probably return to the starting lineup, so that means there's at least a chance Bell stays in the first unit. His upside is almost too high to leave on the wire in active leagues and it helps that his week starts on Monday against the Cavs.

             Martin was just 3-of-8 from the field, but he still managed to post a solid plus-10 rating in his brief time on the floor. Despite the decent production he is still only worth using in deeper fantasy leagues at this point since his offense and minutes are anything but consistent.

             The third-year PG is an afterthought while Jeff Teague (12 points, seven boards, six assists) is healthy, but he should be firmly on fantasy owners' radar. In three starts while Teague was injured this season, Jones averaged 12.3 points, 1.7 triples, 4.0 rebounds, 6.7 assists, 0.7 blocks and a whopping 4.0 steals, all while committing one turnover in 120 minutes of play.

             Dieng moved into second-place on the Wolves' all-time shot blocking list -- at 375 swats, he passed Rasho Nesterovic but remains more than 1,200 blocks behind Kevin Garnett (1,590). The bad news is that Dieng came in averaging a mere 3.9 points in his previous seven games. He's chipping in enough rebounds and defensive stats for value in some deep leagues, but most owners should leave him on the wire.

             Chriss made a 3-pointer tonight and produced enough to satisfy owners who played him vs. Minnesota's suspect defense. That said, he's been impossible to trust this season. He's scored double-digit points in consecutive games just once (Dec. 7-9), he didn't have a single steal or block in his previous five games, and he came in shooting 39.6% from the field and 69.2% from the line. Most re-draft owners should have less infuriating options at their disposal.

He has been a little more aggressive getting to the basket, drawing 14 free-throw attempts over his past two outings. The eight free throws made marked a season high. Fantasy owners will take points anywhere they can get them.

Phoenix effectively chose him over Mike James, whom they cut on Saturday, so his role should be safe going forward -- and if Tyler Ulis (four points in 18 minutes) doesn't pick up his play, Canaan could find himself starting before long.

             Phoenix cut the Wolves' lead from 21 points down to two points in the second half, partly thanks to Chandler's work on the glass, but it wasn't enough. Minnesota won the battle of the boards 47-36, and scored 10 more points at the free-throw line tonight, which accounted for their 10-point margin of victory. With 10 DNPs in his past 24 games, Chandler is merely a streaming option in season-long fantasy leagues.

             Devin Booker (groin) is inching closer to a return, but in his absence Warren has been the go-to offense for Phoenix. He's been up and down all season but turned it on over the past four games, averaging 23.0 points on 48.1% shooting. He's also logging solid minutes as the lone starter with four reserves, so it will be interesting to see if that continues when Booker returns, possibly as soon as Dec. 26.

            Greg Monroe picked up a healthy DNP-CD on Saturday.
        
        
             The Suns' merry-go-round continues at the center position. Tonight it was Tyson Chandler earning the start, with Alex Len posting eight points and four boards in 17 minutes off the bench. Monroe has been solid on a per-game basis in Phoenix, but the frequent DNPs are a headache that's not going away unless Chandler is shut down or a trade alleviates the logjam.

             He is expected to play against the Cavs on Christmas Day. Green was down and in pain for about 10-15 seconds in the second half, so presumably that's when he suffered the injury. He had a typical stat line on Saturday with 10 points, five rebounds, six assists, two steals, two blocks and one 3-pointer.

            James Ennis finished with 14 points off the bench while posting a team-best plus-12 rating across 28 minutes in Saturday's win against the Clippers.
        
        
             Ennis was a very efficient 6-of-8 from the field while hitting 1-of-2 from behind the 3-point line. He also chipped in with two rebounds, an assist and just two turnovers, as he saw a few more minutes with Chandler Parsons not doing very much in his 25 minutes. Interim head coach J.B. Bickerstaff rode the hot hand, and that hand belonged to Ennis. Despite the solid numbers he remains nothing more than a low-end option in deeper fantasy play.

             The highlight of the night for Brooks and his fantasy owners was a 3-of-5 performance from behind the 3-point line. He continues to log plenty of minutes lately, but outside of points and 3-pointers he isn't really much of a fantasy option.

             Evans was efficient from behind the arc, going 6-of-11, while also posted a perfect 4-of-4 night from the charity stripe. He also chipped in with 11 assists, seven rebounds and three steals. He has had top-50 fantasy value this season, but he has been even better lately under interim head coach J.B. Bickerstaff. The coach is leaning on Evans heavily and, more often than not, he is rewarding that confidence with big production.

             Gasol was banging down low with DeAndre Jordan, holding the Clippers center to just four points. The Grizzlies big man hit 7-of-16 from the floor, including 1-of-3 from behind the 3-point line, and he added four assists with a steal and a blocked shot. He was listed as doubtful heading into Saturday's game, but there's no doubt his hip is feeling pretty good after this win.

             Harrell was in the starting lineup for some added size in Houston on Friday night, but he was actually a little more effective in this one off the bench. He hit 2-of-6 from the floor while also adding three rebounds, an assist, a steal and a blocked shot across 13 minutes. He might eventually see a huge role in L.A. if the team decides to part with DeAndre Jordan at some point. Until then, he remains a low-end fantasy option in deeper leagues.

             Jordan hit just 1-of-3 from the floor, and Marc Gasol's presence obviously had a lot to do with that. He also was back to struggling at the free-throw line, going 2-of-4, after his surprisingly effective night at the stripe on Friday. The four points was Jordan's lowest total since he had just two points in a game Nov. 13 against Philadelphia.

             The Pelicans have got hot at times from deep and today it was Clark being the hero with his +16 in plus-minus off the bench. He's basically the fifth guard in the rotation and he wasn't even playing three games ago, so just about all fantasy owners can ignore this one.

             He continues to make way more two-pointers than expected with six today. He has 3.6 twos per game compared to 1.4 treys over his last five games, which is part of the reason he's been over 53 percent from the field on the season. He's a fine hold in standard leagues despite his ugly foul shooting at 52.2 percent -- he only has 0.7 attempts per game. Although, we don't blame you if you want to drop him for a hot add.

            Lou Williams was on fire again off the bench Saturday in Memphis, finishing with 36 points across 35 minutes.
        
        
             Williams hit 10-of-23 from the field, including 5-of-13 from behind the 3-point line, and he added 11-of-12 from the free-throw line. As much as he has surprised this season on the offensive end, this was his first time with back-to-back 30-point games. He is averaging 34.0 PPG over his past two outings while averaging 6.0 3-pointers.

             He's been a really solid pickup and he has basically four avenues for minutes, but Nelson won't be a reliable fantasy play when the Pelicans are healthy at guard.

             Dunn had been on a magnificent run, but the whole Bulls team stunk it up in a bad defeat at the hands of the Celtics. We're not worried about Dunn and will happily toss this performance aside given what he's showed us this season and especially of late. Keep the faith, and don't sell low on a premier early-season waiver wire gem.

             Teodosic was rested in Friday's game in Houston, but he was able to log 32 minutes in this one. He hit 4-of-9 from the floor with 1-of-5 from behind the arc while chipping in with four assists, a rebound and a steal. His plus-11 rating was also better than anyone with an L.A. on their chest. He is still not cleared for back-to-back action, but the good news is the team doesn't have one until Jan. 10-11.

             While Dragic certainly can finish with both hands, he will have to be shooting his jumper with his bad left elbow. Dragic has said his elbow is expected to bother him for a month, so there's a chance we see his jump shooting take a hit. The team was grateful that Dragic could go out there to tough it out, but his fantasy owners may want to lower their expectations for the next couple weeks. Still, he has a good chance to be a mid-round player.

             Valentine had back-to-back nice games coming into this one, but he just couldn't get it going in a tough matchup vs. the Celtics. If you picked Valentine up this week, give him a chance to right the ship in the upcoming week ahead with matchups vs. the Bucks, Knicks, and Pacers before making any decisions. That being said, Zach LaVine's (knee) return will further crowd the picture, so don't get too reliant on Valentine for anything.

""How can we not be encouraged by what we're seeing from Bam?"" It doesn't sound like Hassan Whiteside (knee) will be back too soon, but starting Bam in a weekly league could be risky with only three games.

             The defensive stats were nice, but everything else was not, and the fact that he didn't make a 3-pointer is hard to overlook. Over his last three games, Smart has averaged 12.0 points, 2.0 steals, and 2.0 3-pointers on 12-of-34 (35.3%) shooting, and that's basically reflective of what he's brought to your fantasy team all season. As an aside, in reference to the Bulls, Smart offered an interesting quote. ""I feel like we played our old selves,"" he said.

             Theis took advantage of some garbage time, but the performance is still nice to see and we'll give the 25-year-old his due.

Given Tatum doesn't turn 20 until April 4, it's scary to think about what his future may hold. As a reminder, the Celtics received an additional first-round pick in exchange for the opportunity to move down for Tatum. Nicknames are earned, not given, and Danny Ainge's ""Trader Danny"" moniker wasn't a coincidence.

             Brown did his damage in just 27 minutes. The second-year man still can't hit free throws—just 2-of-4 on Saturday—but he's shooting it well from the field while scoring the rock and contributing steals for his fantasy owners. It doesn't look like Brown will face any limitations moving forward, but an Achilles injury is always worth tracking after a player misses any amount of time.

             Lamb was a solid 4-of-5 from the field while also chipping in with two assists and an assist in his 19 minutes. He still had a pretty decent outing despite the fact Treveon Graham (back) was also back in the mix. Lamb is averaging 18.7 points and 3.0 rebounds over his past three outings. He remains nothing more as a low-end asset as long as Graham is healthy.

             Although 18 points on 18 shots isn't exactly ideal, RHJ deserves credit for another big game in the second of a back-to-back after delivering in a major way on Friday vs. Washington. Hollis-Jefferson has been an asset for anyone fortunate enough to steal him on draft day, and he's done a really nice job proving himself as an NBA player since his rookie season. In related news, the Blazers would probably love to undo Hollis-Jefferson for Mason Plumlee trade right about now.

He's been dealing with right forearm tightness all season, describing it as a ""wacky"" injury, but it hasn't cost him any games and he said it's been improving. Tonight's hot shooting is a great sign, considering he came in at a career-low 40.3 percent, and he's rounding into form as one of the league's elite fantasy players.

The rookie returned tonight and Rubio's numbers predictably tumbled, as he's getting fewer touches with Mitchell on-ball so much for the Jazz.

            Rodney Hood had a rough night off the bench on Saturday, shooting 3-of-14 to finish with nine points, two 3-pointers, one rebound, one assist and one steal in 31 minutes.
        
        
             Hood was coming off a big 29-point outburst on Thursday, and he said afterward, ""I’ve got to be aggressive and score. I’ve got to take shots even [when] I’m missing them."" Donovan Mitchell (bruised toe) was back in action tonight, which bumped Hood to the second unit, but a sixth-man role suits him just fine. We're not reading into his struggles and coach Quin Snyder even said before the game, ""I have no expectation [for Hood] other than he stays aggressive.""

            Caris LeVert had 14 points, four rebounds, two assists, a steal, and two 3-pointers on 5-of-10 shooting on Saturday, but he also had six turnovers in a 123-119 OT loss to the Pacers.
        
        
             LeVert really burned those relying on him in nine-cat settings with the six giveaways on the evening, but he played significantly more minutes (34) than any other reserve and it's clear his role is growing. Those who picked up the Michigan man should keep rolling him out there, and it's worth noting that LeVert had just six turnovers combined over his last four games prior to Saturday's outing.

             The rookie missed two games with the injury but he wasn't limited at all tonight, making 12-of-16 FGs and 4-of-4 FTs over 37 minutes. One of his makes came from downtown and he continues to vie with Jayson Tatum (and Ben Simmons) as the best rookie to own in fantasy. Make sure he's back in your active lineups for Utah's upcoming three-game week.

             Batum wasn't a fantasy beast, but he did what he does best - contribute a little bit in multiple categories. He also was credited with a pair of blocked shot and a steal while turning it over just once. Batum continues to nursing a left elbow injury, and that's keeping him from being his normal productive self. Hopefully a few days off at the holiday break will do him some good.

             DSJ was also 2-of-3 at the line and this highlights his biggest flaws in category-based leagues -- he's killing owners with 39.6% FGs and 67.3% FTs. He's also contributed one steal and zero blocks since returning from injury three games ago, but all owners can do is bench him until he gets going -- the minutes will soon increase, and Dallas will let him play through mistakes as they look toward the future.

             Ferrell dropped a season-high 23 points during Friday's loss, but he cooled off tonight with 3-of-7 shooting. It didn't help that Devin Harris (illness) was active, and Ferrell also struggled with fouls tonight. He's helped his cause with solid percentages over the past month (45.5% FGs, 91.7% FTs), in addition to steady 3-pointers (1.7) and low turnovers (1.2).

He's adding a modest 8.2 points, 5.3 rebounds, 0.9 assists, 0.6 steals and 0.4 blocks in that span, however, so the FG% is the extent of his value.

He's off until Wednesday's game vs. the Wizards, but it's safe to say his ankle is fine.

With zero DNPs to date this season, he's easily exceeding most draft-day expectations.

            Dwight Howard (finger) was able to start Saturday's game against the Bucks and he scored 21 points with 16 rebounds across 32 minutes in the 111-106 win.
        
        
             Howard also chipped in with two assists and two blocked shots while hitting 7-of-11 from the field. The finger was obviously not a problem, and his presence bothered the Giannis Antetokounmpo-less Bucks all night long. It was Howard's best shooting night in a while, as he entered shooting 41.0 percent (16-of-39) over the past five outings while averaging just 10.4 PPG.

            Wesley Matthews notched seven points four assists, two rebounds and two steals in 33 minutes on Saturday, making 3-of-9 shots with one 3-pointer.
        
        
             Dallas wrapped up their two-game trip with a tough loss in Atlanta. Matthews is shooting 43.2 percent this season, but that's largely due to where he's getting his shots -- more than 57% of his attempts have come from downtown. The bigger issue is the lack of overall scoring (11.9 points), rebounds (3.1), assists (2.8) and blocks (0.1). He's clinging to top-120 and shows no signs of going much higher.

            DeMarre Carroll went off for a huge double-double on Saturday vs. the Pacers, finishing the overtime loss with 20 points, 13 boards, four assists, and four 3-pointers on 7-of-17 shooting.
        
        
             The 13 rebounds mark a career-high for Carroll, and the double-double was his third of the season. Some defensive stats would have been nice, but there's really no complaints about this line, especially since the veteran had just one turnover in 37 minutes. When it comes to relying on Carroll for fantasy production, we feel a lot better when Kenny Atkinson is on his team. Including tonight's effort, Carroll has been delivering over his last few games, averaging 16.7 points, 8.7 rebounds, 3.0 assists, and 2.7 triples on 43.2% from the field during that stretch.

            J.J. Barea handed out a season-high 12 assists in 29 minutes of Saturday, with 15 points on 6-of-11 shooting, two 3-pointers, two rebounds and three steals.
        
        
             Barea flies under the radar but he's a solid specialist if you need assists, which aren't easy to find on the waiver wire. The veteran is dishing 5.6 dimes per game this season, which is more than Jrue Holiday, Reggie Jackson, Kyrie Irving, Ricky Rubio or Goran Dragic. Just don't expect him to give you well-rounded production.

             Harris was a game-time decision tonight but he suited up and helped the Mavs bench outscore their Hawks' counterparts, 46-31, but that wasn't enough for a road win. Harris made 3-of-7 FGs and 2-of-2 FTs, with a pair of 3-pointers, and he's now able to rest until Tuesday's home game vs. Toronto.

             Ersan Ilyasova is playing well as the starting PF, and coach Mike Budenholzer has taken a shine to big man Tyler Cavanaugh (seven points, five boards in 15 minutes). That leaves Babbitt on the outside of the rotation, a situation that might not change if those aforementioned guys stay healthy.

             Dinwiddie started and finished hot—including hitting three free throws to send the game into overtime—but he didn't do a whole lot in between and missed the potential game-winning triple. The Nets look good with Dinwiddie running the show, and it wouldn't be surprising to see D'Angelo Russell (knee) return as the starting two-guard when he's ready to get back onto the floor.

             Kilpatrick is fitting in nicely inking a two-way contract with the team last week. He hit 5-of-9 from the field, including 1-of-4 from behind the arc, in his most meaningful action so far. If he continues to perform like this he'll carve out a nice role for himself in Cream City. However, he is only worth fantasy consideration in the deepest of leagues at this point.

             You'd think the Wizards scoring a season-high 130 points would mean John Wall went off, but that's not the case -- Brad Beal didn't either with 17 points. Wall had a massive letdown for his fantasy owners with this one and a 10-point, 16-minute dud due to a minutes limit on Friday. Maybe this can create a small buy-low window here, especially with no back-to-backs until Jan. 5. Christmas should be fun against Kyrie.

He was also a decent 2-of-2 from the free-throw line. Maker hasn't had a double-digit performance in the scoring column since Nov. 22, so he can be left to the waiver wire in most fantasy leagues as long as the Bucks remain relatively healthy.

             It's a good sign to see him start and maybe this will help prevent the seesaw of value with him and Bogdan Bogdanovic. Hield is worth a look in standard leagues.

            Bojan Bogdanovic had a solid revenge game vs. Brooklyn, finishing Saturday's win with 17 points, six rebounds, a steal, a block, and two 3-pointers in 40 big minutes.
        
        
             Bogdanovic looked like he was going to post a dud at halftime, but he turned it around in the second half and finished strong for the winning team. The 40 minutes were a season-high for Bogdanovic, who has really filled a nice role at a great value for a Pacers team outplaying expectations. If you're holding onto BB, he hasn't given you any reason to lose the faith yet, so keep on rolling him out there.

             Delly was making the start in place of Giannis Antetokounmpo (knee), but he didn't come anywhere close to replacing the offense of the Greek Freak. The guard hit just 2-of-5 from the floor, but at least he didn't turn it over. Even in a starting role Dellavedova isn't a major fantasy asset at this time.

             This was one of his better games of the season and his minutes seem to be back to normal. Morris has played 27 minutes in three of the last four games and he's looked better overall, so maybe he can start to trend up after a disappointing start.

             Bledsoe hit 6-of-13 from the field, but he was 1-of-5 from the perimeter, including a potential game-tying triple in the final seconds which might have forced overtime. He has hit at least one 3-pointer in 16 consecutive outings, but he has also turned it over three or more times in seven straight contests. You have to take the good with the bad, and there is way more good for fantasy owners with Bledsoe.

Although the veteran point guard won't do anything to hurt you, it's hard to get excited about relying on him to play an important role on your fantasy squad.

             Henson was a very efficient 7-of-10 from the field and he hit 2-of-4 from the free-throw stripe. His production at the offensive end has yo-yoed a bit over the past few games, but he remains a solid source of rebounds for fantasy owners. He is usually a decent source of blocked shots, too, although Dwight Howard has a lot to do with his lack of swats in the past two nights. In fact, Henson has no blocked shots in four meetings with Charlotte this season, and 44 swats in 26 games against everyone else.

            For the third time in four games, Thaddeus Young couldn't crack the 10-point barrier, finishing Saturday's game with just three points, six boards, and four assists on 1-of-4 shooting.
        
        
             It's possible that Thad's left knee is still sore, as Young hadn't scored in single digits since November 27 before the aforementioned stretch. It's also worth noting that the veteran forward has had single-digit shot attempts in five straight games, as well. This could be a good opportunity to buy low on Young, but we'd be very careful about what we'd be willing to offer.

             He had himself a really nice week with this game and a career-high 28 points back on the 17th. Hezonja has shown he can play three positions for the Magic, but his value is tied to Aaron Gordon (calf). Gordon was called doubtful today and wasn't out there, so maybe Hezonja moves to the background when the Magic play again on Tuesday.

             While it's nice to see a good line here, this might be his last chance with big minutes because Evan Fournier (ankle) is getting vey close to a return. Leave Iwundu on the wire.

             He's been used mostly as a power forward, but now he might be shifting to center out of necessity. Although, coach Frank Vogel probably won't trust him much in that role, so Speights isn't an add unless you're in a super deep league.

            Myles Turner came through in a big way in Indiana's 123-119 OT victory vs. Brooklyn on Saturday, delivering 23 points, nine rebounds, three 3-pointers and a season-high six blocks.
        
        
             To top off this awesome stat line, Turner hit 8-of-10 shots from the field and 4-of-5 from the charity stripe. That's now back-to-back 20-burgers for Turner after his two-point stinker, so he'll look to build upon those two outings going forward. Although inconsistency has plagued Turner's game-to-game performance, he's a difference-maker in the blocks department and the 38 minutes against Brooklyn's fast-paced attack is certainly an encouraging sign.

             Dipo finished with four boards, six assists, one steal, one block, and two triples on 13-of-23 shooting, including a perfect 10-of-10 from the foul line. The best part? Oladipo didn't turn the rock over a single time, solidifying this gem of a performance for those relying on him in nine-cat settings. Although widely criticized at the time the deal was done, the Paul George trade is being viewed a lot differently these days because Oladipo is the real deal.

             He should be very busy as an offensive weapon because of no Nikola Vucevic (hand) and the other injuries. With Vooch off the floor, Simmons gets a 10.5 usage rate boost with increases to his rebounding and assist percentages, too. We'd still like to see him up his percentages, but Juice should be in for some sweet stat lines.

             His efficiency was outstanding, making 11-of-16 from the field and all eight from the line.  Nikola Vucevic (hand) is out, which is noteworthy for Payton because he gets a 4.1 usage rate boost and his efficiency goes up 5.0 TS% points when he's not with Vooch. Payton has been pretty bad this month, so now he could get hot in a hurry.

             Johnson returned ahead of his initial timetable tonight, so maybe that wasn't a wise decision. He's receiving treatment in the locker room after halftime and may be held out regardless if the score gets out of hand -- Miami trails by 13 points near the end of the third quarter.

             It makes sense and coach Luke Walton has run Hart out there in a three-guard lineup plenty of times this season -- also with Jordan Clarkson and Ball. Hart isn't going to get many shots, but he could still put up a decent line tonight because he should see a decent amount of minutes. Ingram doesn't sound like he'll be out long, so Hart isn't a strong add at this time.

Biyombo is really the only five man on the roster and he was playing in the upper 30s during a three-game stretch last year. He has no offensive game, but he's still worth an add in most standard leagues because blocks are gold.

             That's two good games in a row with a 12-point game on Thursday. Maybe he likes to play Philly because both of these lines came against them, but Wright was playing well before his shoulder injury. He was also leading the team in fourth-quarter minutes before his injury, so he's firmly on the radar in deep leagues.

             Now that the Raptors are starting to get healthy again, Siakam has lost some opportunity. He can play so many different roles and he's really improved in so many areas this year, so he has a lot of ways to get minutes. He's a decent stash in deep leagues.

             He was extremely busy to start this game with the 76ers' first six shots from the field and the first two free throws -- the only other possession used for the first eight was a Ben Simmons turnover. The 76ers clearly had a plan to limit Embiid as he played in shorter stints in his return after missing the last week. He'll probably be in the upper 20s against the Knicks on Monday, but obviously his fantasy owners have to be excited to see him back out there.

             Lillard sat out back-to-back games on Friday and Saturday to rest up, after straining his hamstring when Pau Gasol crashed into his leg earlier in the week. He said the hamstring has made ""big progress"" over the past few days, so it sounds like he'll be ready to roll after Christmas. His return will sent Shabazz Napier back to the bench.

             Only five shots is shocking for Lord Covington to tie his season low. This was a season-low 9.6 usage rate for him and it's his second lowest usage rate in the last two seasons. That's a little surprising because of no J.J. Redick (hamstring), so expect him to bounce back on Christmas against the Knicks.

             Some of this was because of garbage time, but it also may have had to do because of the matchup against the size of the Raptors. Luwawu-Cabarrot really hasn't done much to garner attention in fantasy, so keep him on the wire unless Brett Brown mixes it up or J.J.

             Booker has been doing some on-court work lately and he was doing even more work before the game today. The Suns will be cautious with him, so it's possible he has a minutes limit once he's back. We should have a few more updates in the coming days.

            Richaun Holmes only played in garbage time with three rebounds, one assist and one turnover in four minutes against the Raptors on Saturday.
        
        
             Maybe Amir Johnson was ahead of him because it was against one of his former teams, but Holmes has been the third big more often than not when Joel Embiid is a go. He's still worth a stash in some leagues, especially with Embiid having health issues right now.

            Nikola Vucevic (hand) is expected to undergo surgery on his fractured left hand and be sidelined 6-8 weeks, according to Shams Charania of Yahoo! Sports.
        
        
             That's a fairly standard timetable for a fracture to a first metacarpal, so that means Vooch is basically out until the All-Star Game or later. This is a terrible blow to the Magic and his fantasy owners, especially with Vucevic putting up early-round value with his 17.8 points and 9.6 boards per game this season. Bismack Biyombo has a chance to be a difference maker in blocks and board, so he's worth an add in standard leagues for anyone needing help in those two areas.

            Nikola Vucevic (hand) fractured his left first metacarpal on Saturday and he will be out indefinitely.
        
        
             Bad news here. A fractured first metcarapal will almost always cost a player at least one month and it could be even longer depending on how bad the fracture is to his thumb. The Magic are also not looking good in the standings, so that won't help his timeline. Adding Bismack Biyombo in 12-team leagues is not a bad idea and it looks like Adreian Payne will be the backup five man for owners in super deep leagues.

             That means he's probably not going to play today after popping up on the injury report for knee soreness. Parsons will likely get around 20 minutes with Jarell Martin backing him up. If you were thinking about dropping Green in a shallower league, this might be enough to get you to make a move.

So he'll have to go through our process of getting it better, getting it healthier, getting it stronger. And then we'll go from there,"" Spo said.

            Kevon Looney (glute) is available to play against the Nuggets on Saturday.
        
        
             He was probable and he should be out there in the second unit. Looney has very little value because Jordan Bell is having a monster rookie season for a second rounder.

            Brandon Ingram (right quad, left quad) will not play against the Blazers on Saturday.
        
        
             It's being called a contusion and tendinitis. Ingram looked like he took a knee below the belt on Friday, and perhaps that's what caused this injury. This is a back-to-back game, so hopefully that's a factor on him missing this one. With him out tonight, we'll be seeing more Josh Hart, Jordan Clarkson and we may see some rare Kyle Kuzma at the three -- Kuzma is playing a ton regardless.

             He got a spot start against the Knicks because Jaylen Brown couldn't play, but the second-year wing is back. Smart does shoot the ball worse when he's coming off the bench and he's awful at home with only a 29.5 FG% at TD Garden this season.

             That means we should get another game of Mr. Jordan Bell after he put up a 20-10 against the Lakers. Bell's fantasy supporters will be hoping Zaza takes his time and maybe Bell takes his job. Also, coach Steve Kerr said Zaza will ""probably"" get his starting job back. Go Bell tonight.

The Hawks are dead last in the NBA and they probably have one eye on the college lottery talent, so they could limit Schroder tonight or in the future.

             He rolled his troublesome left ankle on Friday, so this is not a surprise that he's not out there today. The good news is the MRI was negative, so this could be more of a day-to-day issue. It looks like Goran Dragic (elbow) could be back, so that means Wayne Ellington won't quite be in the same position to thrive like he did for his 28-point explosion. Still, Ellington is worth a look while Tyler Johnson could still have nice value even with Dragic possibly back.

             Nothing is imminent on this, but it's no secret the Lakers want to clear out as much cap space this year to make room to sign free agents. If Clarkson does get traded, that would likely help out Josh Hart and maybe even Alex Caruso.

            Dennis Schroder (left ankle) is likely to play against the Mavs on Saturday.
        
        
             He was a game-time call on Friday, but he was ruled out just before tip time. If Schroder is a go, that would likely push Kent Bazemore back to the wing and Marco Belinelli back to the bench. Schroder has shot the ball fairly well on the season, but he's trended down this month. His return also takes away from Malcolm Delaney and Isaiah Taylor.

             Hezonja was playing well coming into Friday night, but coach Frank Vogel went with Marreese Speights to get him more size and shooting. Hezonja averages as a starter are 13.6 points, 5.0 boards, 1.6 assists, 1.0 steals, 0.8 blocks and 2.4 treys. He's on the board for DFS today, but won't have much value when Aaron Gordon (calf) can return.

             This is the same right knee that kept him out on Nov. 22 and also for EuroBasket. There's a decent chance this won't be the last day off for Antetokounmpo and his fantasy owners will have to be on the lookout for back-to-back games -- he scored 26 points on Friday. With him out, it'll be Matt Dellavedova starting, but Eric Bledsoe and Khris Middleton will be in a very favorable spot to post massive stat lines.

             Fournier was on the court running and shooting prior to the game, however, so it sounds like he's nearing a return. The Magic don't play again until Tuesday which may have influenced the thinking here, giving him three more full days to rest before potentially facing the Heat in Miami. Jonathon Simmons should be particularly busy with Fournier, Aaron Gordon (calf) and Jonathan Isaac (ankle) all out again tonight.

            Kemba Walker (head) and Dwight Howard (finger) will warm up on Saturday with the intent to play.
        
        
             Walker has a head contusion, but he didn't have a concussion from his injury late in the fourth quarter on Friday. Walker will get another matchup against the Bucks, so he will look to build off his 32 points from Friday night. For now, expect him to be a full go.

It'll be interesting to see how far back his minutes get dialed back, but go ahead and get him in your lineup.

             ""I don’t know if that will be the exact game, but the big thing is how he responds to the consecutive days of contact because he has not had that yet,"" Hoiberg said. That Jan. 13 date is noteworthy because it's Zach LaVine bobblehead night. The Bulls have said they want him to go through six practices with the first coming on what could be Dec. 30. Hoiberg did add that LaVine had a bit of a workout setback seven to 10 days ago when he got hurt dunking, which was related to his back. Regardless, it'll probably take until February before he's a reliable fantasy asset.

Monroe actually played OK and had a big play late in the game with an assist to Troy Daniels to help win the game. The Suns are still holding Monroe as a trade chip, but they're clearly in no rush to move him.

             He is battling soreness in his right knee, but it hasn't really affected his minutes with fairly consistent 30 per game this month. Green did have a knee problem last year, but that was to his left knee. If he can't go, that would likely mean Jarell Martin would be the next man up and Chandler Parsons would slide over to play the four. Martin could be worth a look in DFS today.

We'll consider him questionable for the Raps next game, Tuesday vs. Dallas. With Miles sidelined on Saturday, OG Anunoby and Norman Powell will soak up additional minutes.

             It's unknown how often the Bulls will be able to practice in early January, or if Chicago will consider shootarounds as practices. Nonetheless, while a firm return date remains elusive, it's clear that LaVine is making solid progress and is headed in the right direction. He will be limited after returning to the lineup, but is certainly worth stashing if you have an open IR-spot or have room at the bottom of your roster in deeper leagues.

However, Malcolm Delaney scored 20 points and dished out six assists in 27 minutes off the bench. Isaiah Taylor had seven points and four assists in 17 minutes.

            Marc Gasol (left hip) remains doubtful for Saturday's game vs. the Clippers, but he will test the hip pregame before making a final decision.
        
        
             Gasol surprisingly popped up on the injury report Friday evening and we still don't have details on the situation. Saturday's game tips off at 8:00 pm EST, so hopefully, we'll get confirmation, one way or the other, prior to 7 pm. If Gasol is unable to play, Brandan Wright,  Deyonta Davis and JaMychal Green will likely divvy up most of the minutes at center Saturday night.

             Brown sat out Thursday's loss to the Knicks, but it appears it will be just a one-game absence. Marcus Smart started on Thursday but will likely get bumped to the bench with Brown back in the mix.

             Isaac finally returned to the lineup earlier this week but then reaggravated his ankle injury in Wednesday's loss to the Bulls. Isaac sat out Friday and is unlikely to play Saturday. Mario Hezonja, Wesley Iwundu and Adreian Payne should see a few extra minutes if Isaac is unable to suit up.

             This was an easy decision for the Lillard and the Blazers. Keeping him out Saturday allows Dame plenty of extra rest, which is important, as hamstring injuries tend to linger if not properly healed. With Lillard sidelined on Friday, Shabazz Napier logged 37 minutes off the bench and finished with 14 points, five assists, four rebounds and three steals. Pat Connaughton had 12 points and four rebounds in 22 minutes.

Aaron Gordon (calf) and Jonathan Isaac (ankle) are also listed as doubtful for Saturday's contest. Elfrid Payton, Jonathon Simmons, and Nikola Vucevic have been the only reliable Magic players of late.

The Magic's next game is Tuesday vs. Miami, which means Gordon would get three more full days of rest if he sits out Saturday. Marreese Speights started in place of Gordon on Friday night but finished with just seven points and one rebound in 18 minutes. Mario Hezonja had 11 points and four rebounds in 20 minutes off the bench.

             Casspi hit 5-of-8 from the floor, and he has now posted double-digit point totals in a season-high five consecutive games. He is averaging 12.8 points, 7.8 rebounds and 2.0 assists per game over the past five outings. Casspi is helping pick up the slack with Steph Curry (ankle) on the mend, but he is only worth using in deeper fantasy leagues and as a low-cost DFS option.

             Chandler also played a team-high 42 minutes, adding 11 rebounds and two triples. Chandler was cold coming into tonight's game with single-digit points in each of his last three games, but he usually gets big minutes when he's healthy. He's a hit-or-miss option, especially while the Nuggets are near full strength.

             Not much rust there and it feels like the Warriors had him scheduled to play in this game all along. The Warriors do play in a back-to-back set when they host Denver on Saturday and this game is not a national TV contest, so his fantasy owners will have to be on the lookout for a rest day. Additionally, Green was chatting with Lakers coach Luke Walton and was asked about it. ""I got you your job. You better tell your guys over there,"" Green said. As long as he's active, Green will have a huge upside until Stephen Curry (ankle) returns.

             Durant took the Dubs on his back again with Steph Curry (ankle) sidelined, adding seven rebounds, seven assists, two steals and four blocked shots. Two of the swats came on the same series against Julius Randle late in the fourth quarter with the game hanging in the balance. KD has been on another plane defensively, and he continues to put up big lines with his brethren in and out of the lineup.

Murray was coasting as an early-round player over his last 10 games, so his fantasy owners can just throw this one out. Expect a bounce-back performance against the Warriors on Saturday.

             The Nuggets snapped a nine-game losing streak in Portland and coach Mike Malone said he noticed Jokic taking a different approach in his battle with Nurkic. ""In the past, Nikola had not been as aggressive as he needed to be,"" Malone said. ""Tonight, I think he got over a mental block. He went out there and attacked and was so effective all over the floor."" Jokic has played 36+ minutes in two straight games which means his restrictions have been lifted, but he has a brutal matchup vs. the Warriors on Saturday -- they held him to eight points on 2-of-6 shooting in their previous meeting.

             He was awesome and coach Steve Kerr really talked him up during his in-game interview on ESPN. ""Well, we knew he was good, and we're giving him more and more playing time,"" Kerr said. Draymond Green returned tonight and it's hardly a surprise to see that Bell was ringing loud and clear.

             He was also 3-of-4 from the line with two rebounds, two assists, three steals and one block in 38 minutes. Harris was getting easy looks at the rim all night with all seven of his makes in the restricted area, and he also did an outstanding job on defense, helping Denver limit C.J. McCollum to 15 points.

However, he was a dismal 2-of-9 from the field, and he is shooting just 23.1 percent (6-of-26) from the floor over his past three contests.

             He had some strong efficiency here, making 12-of-17 from the field and all five free throws for a 78.1 true shooting percentage. Interestingly, Westbrook's two most efficient games have been in his last two with this one and a season-high 81.3 TS% coming on Wednesday. Over the last 15 games, Westbrook's usage rate of 34.9 is more than 10 percentage points higher than any of his teammates. He still has a huge hole to dig himself out of to justify his price in nine-category leagues, but his owners have to be happy to see his increased efficiency.

             Randle connected for 7-of-16 from the floor, including 2-of-3 from behind the 3-point line, as he was much more effective off the bench than Andrew Bogut was in a starting role in the middle.

             He needed this one badly, making just 26.7 percent from deep in his previous December games. Anthony seems to be coming to grips that he's not going to dominate like he did as a Knick. ""I think for me it’s just a matter of accepting that role,"" Melo said. Coach Billy Donovan was also asked about Melo being a catch-and-shoot guy and if that could be ideal. ""Yes. 100 percent,"" Donovan said. Melo has been really good as a catch-and-shoot guy in previous seasons, so maybe he can start to trend up again.

"Lonzo Ball
                 
                 
                      - G -  Lakers
                
                 
            
        
        
        
            Lonzo Ball finished with 24 points in Friday's 113-106 loss at Golden State, highlighted by his five 3-pointers.
        
        
             Ball also chipped in with five rebounds, five assists and a blocked shot. He started out with some struggles at the offensive end, but his shot has been much better lately and he is starting to gain more and more confidence every time out. He has two or more 3-pointers in five consecutive outings and he has grabbed five or more boards in seven straight contests.

"Paul George
                 
                 
                      - F -  Thunder
                
                 
            
        
        
        
            Paul George scored 17 points with five rebounds, two assists, three steals, one block and two 3-pointers in 40 minutes against the Hawks on Friday.
        
        
             It was Russell Westbrook taking the last shot and George was asked about it after the game. ""Russ is as good as anyone when it's closing time,"" George said. He didn't seem very excited about it and it's fair to wonder if he's OK with being the second fiddle. George's usage rate has taken a serious hit from last year, especially in the clutch. This year, he only has a 20.0 usage rate in the the clutch compared to a 40.0 last season. He's still doing damage in the non-scoring stuff, so he should continue to be an early-round guy.

"Kentavious Caldwell-Pope
                 
                 
                      - G -  Lakers
                
                 
            
        
        
        
            Kentavious Caldwell-Pope (personal) was back in the lineup and available to the team Friday at Golden State, but he struggled mightily with his shot.
        
        
             KCP hit just 4-of-16 from the field, including 1-of-10 from behind the 3-point line. He was available to the team on work release, since this game was played within the confines of the borders of California. He'll continue to be available Saturday against Portland and Monday against Minnesota, and he should be a little more crisp since he isn't expected to have any games off in between.

"Shabazz Napier
                 
                 
                      - G -  Trail Blazers
                
                 
            
        
        
        
            Shabazz Napier started the second half of Friday's loss to the Nuggets, scoring 14 points (6-of-15 FGs) with five assists, four rebounds, three steals and one 3-pointer in 37 minutes.
        
        
             Jake Layman started but was invisible in 10 minutes. Napier was actually listed as the starting point guard in the game notes, so maybe he'll get the nod on Saturday vs. the Lakers since the Layman experiment didn't work. The Lakers have allowed the fifth most fantasy points to PGs this season, so Napier will be a solid streaming option.

"Andrew Bogut
                 
                 
                      - C -  Lakers
                
                 
            
        
        
        
            Andrew Bogut started his second consecutive game Friday at Golden State and he ended up with six points across 12 minutes.
        
        
             Bogut hit 3-of-5 from the field while adding three rebounds and a blocked shot, but head coach Luke Walton felt more comfortable leaning upon Julius Randle in the second half. The Aussie big might be worth a look if you're desperate for center help in deeper leagues, but he should be left to the waiver wire more often than not.
