            Kyle Kuzma grabbed a career-high 15 boards with 12 points, three assists, two steals and two 3-pointers in 32 minutes against the Mavs on Saturday.
        
        
             His playing time was a little inconsistent to end January, but that probably won't be the case anymore. Coach Luke Walton went away from Kuzma at times because of his defense, but that was because he had Larry Nance. Expect Kuzma to look more like the Kuzmania version we saw to finish 2017.

             Swaggy P made the most of his few minutes off the bench, hitting 3-of-5 from the field, including 3-of-4 from behind the 3-point line. Despite the sharp shooting, he played just four minutes. That's not good for anyone's fantasy value. He is still only worth fantasy consideration in the deepest of leagues until further notice.

            David West ended up Saturday's 122-105 win against the Spurs with 14 points, four rebounds, an assist and a blocked shot over 17 minutes off the bench.
        
        
             West was a very efficient 6-of-6 from the field, as he picked up the slack with Kevin Durant struggling a bit with his shot. Head coach Steve Kerr might have leaned upon West even more if he weren't in foul trouble for most of the evening. Despite the fact that he saved Golden State's bacon for the second time this week, his fantasy appeal remains rather minimal.

            Brook Lopez scored 16 points with two rebounds, five assists and one 3-pointer in 26 minutes against the Mavs on Saturday.
        
        
             He was one of the biggest fantasy winners at the trade deadline because Larry Nance was taking a lot of his minutes. Lopez can be a top-50 player with minutes in the mid 20s, so his fantasy owners should consider him a must-start player again.

            Kevin Durant ended up with just 10 points, six rebounds and six assists over 29 minutes in Saturday's 122-105 win against the Spurs.
        
        
             The overall line wasn't terrible, but he was just 3-of-9 from the field, including 0-of-1 from behind the 3-point arc. KD was able to help out with two blocked shots, too, so it wasn't a total loss. However, he'll look to get back on track Monday against Phoenix, the worst defensive team in the NBA. Perhaps Durant's hand was still bothering him a bit, causing him to miss shots he'd normally make.

             Green also chipped in with a steal and a blocked shot while turning in a solid plus-14 rating. He hit 8-of-16 from the field, and was 1-of-5 from behind the 3-point line. Surprisingly, he didn't make any trips to the free-throw line. Green has a pair of double-doubles over his past two outings, but he did it with points and rebounds in his last contest. Green is also working on a 12-game streak with at least one blocked shot.

             The usage was down a tad, but Hart isn't really a scorer anyway. The big difference is that he only had two boards after he averaged 11.0 per game over his previous four, adding averages of 13.5 points, 3.0 dimes, 1.3 steals and 2.5 treys. He'll be getting his minutes the rest of the way and it's possible he still starts even when Lonzo Ball returns. He should be owned in standard leagues.

             He's really picked it up and he came through in the hometown game. Randle is a huge fantasy winner from the Larry Nance Jr. deal and he's already really picked it up even before the deadline. He should be looking at a strong finish to redeem his bad start this season.

             Curry hit 7-of-13 from the field, and 3-of-7 from behind the 3-point line. He was limping heading into a timeout late in the first quarter, but he said after the game that his right ankle was ""fine."" It's possible, even if his ankle if fine, that he could be rested on Monday against the defensively-challenged Phoenix Suns, as Curry has a busy schedule heading into the All-Star weekend. But so far it appears he can and wants to play through the injury.

             Maybe he's a little rusty after missing a week, but Markkanen has struggled on back-to-back sets. Compared to days with rest, Markkanen's scoring and rebounding are noticeably worse when he's on a back-to-back. He'll be outstanding the rest of the way, but DFS players may want to file this note away for the next B2B.

             He really can't make shots right now. In his last 10 games, his 32.0 field goal percentage is almost lower than his 29.2 minutes per game. Oubre has a big opportunity right now, but he really needs to start hitting shots to put up value. He's still a hold in most situations.

             Forbes was a dismal 0-of-7 from the field, including 0-of-3 from behind the 3-point line, and he didn't have any other statistics beside his one turnover and minus-19 rating. Not good. He and Danny Green struggled, so thankfully veteran Manu Ginobili was able to step up and give the Spurs something off of the bench. Forbes will look to bounce back Monday at Utah.

             Ginobili hit 5-of-13 from the field, including 3-of-8 from behind the 3-point line, while adding six assists and one rebound with just one turnover. The ageless wonder saw a little extra playing time with Danny Green and Bryn Forbes struggling and Dejounte Murray and Tony Parker out due to injury. Ginobili took advantage, but he still remains nothing more than a low-end fantasy option in deeper leagues at this point of his career.

             It was a scary game for Embiid with several bumps and bruises. Embiid had to go to the locker room, but he was able to return. He was also asked about it after the game and didn't sound too concerned. He said his knee took contact from the floor and it didn't twist, and he said he knew he was going to check back in after the quick trip. Embiid also said he didn't get treatment and that he wasn't nervous about coming back. He should be ready to roll, but don't be surprised to see him on the injury report as a precaution.

             White hit 3-of-8 from the field, including 0-of-2 from behind the 3-point line, while going 5-of-6 from the free-throw stripe. He also added seven rebounds, two assists and a steal, outplaying Patty Mills. It appears White will see a good chunk of playing time while Dejounte Murray and Tony Parker are on the shelf. White could even potentially draw a start Monday in Utah with as bad as Mills looked in a starting role on Saturday.

             Mills hit just 3-of-10 from the field, including 1-of-5 from behind the 3-point line, and he seems to look a lot more comfortable coming off of the bench. The good news is he did not turn the ball over, but he also didn't contribute much in the way of the other offensive categories, either. Even with Dejounte Murray and Tony Parker out, Mills posted a rather underwhelming line.

The only hole in his game on Saturday was his ugly 2-of-5 night from the free-throw stripe and his four turnovers. He'll look to keep up the good work on Monday at Utah.

             Bertans continues to start with Pau Gasol coming off the bench, and he is doing a decent enough job. He was an efficient 4-of-7 from the field, while going 1-of-4 from behind the 3-point line. The good news is that he is taking good care of the basketball, but coach Gregg Popovich wouldn't commit to Bertans as the long-term starter. He remains useful only in the deepest of fantasy leagues even if he is a part of the starting five.

He also added five rebounds, four assists and two blocked shots over his 29 minutes, but things go away from San Antonio in the second half after they built a 10-point lead after one quarter. Aldridge continues to be the most steady fantasy option in San Antonio, turning in top-50 value for a team which has had to scramble for most of the season to replace star Kawhi Leonard. If not for Aldridge the Spurs would really be in a world of hurt.

This loss pushed the Clippers back down to the No. 9 spot and the Jazz are probably going to pass them, too.

             Well, this line probably swung some fantasy matchups. Since steals became official in 1973-74, Anthony Davis joins Bob McAdoo as the only players with multiple career games with at least 40 points, 15 rebounds and 5 steals. The Pelicans needed this win badly and they did blow a 28-point lead, so coming away with the win is big time. Davis is going to be incredible without Boogie Cousins.

            Bobby Portis was ejected for a flagrant foul on Tomas Satoransky on Saturday.
        
        
             It was a really bad foul and an easy flagrant two. There's a chance Portis can get a suspension for this foul, so his owners will want to make sure he's a go for the next one. He had a decent game on Saturday with 13 points, four rebounds, one assist, one steal and one 3-pointer in 23 minutes.

            Tomas Satoransky went to the locker room after a fall in the fourth quarter on Saturday against the Bulls.
        
        
             It was scary on a bad flagrant two from Bobby Portis. Satoransky looked to be bleeding from his head and he's getting checked for a concussion right now. Hopefully he's OK because Tim Frazier also went down with a nasal fracture. Before the injury, Satoransky exploded for a career-high 25 points with three rebounds, six assists, two steals and five 3-pointers in 37 minutes. The Wizards will probably be signing Derrick Rose.

             It wasn't a great shooting night, as was 2-of-7 from the field, including 0-of-4 from behind the 3-point line. He did all of his damage at the free-throw line, finishing a perfect 7-of-7. It was his 22nd time scoring in double digits this season. He'll continue to have a little more playing time with Aaron Gordon (hip) on the mend, but he'll need to shoot better if he wants to keep Shelvin Mack from carving into his playing time.

            Marco Belinelli plans to sign with the 76ers once he clears waivers, according to Shams Charania of Yahoo! Sports.
        
        
             More people are trusting the process these days and they'll add another great shooter in Belinelli. He will be coming off the bench and should find himself getting minutes close to 20. It'll be interesting to see if he takes minutes from guys like T.J. McConnell or maybe a struggling Robert Covington. Belinelli isn't worth adding in most leagues.

             Mack posted a season-high in assists and his first double-double of the season. It was also the sixth double-double of his NBA career. D.J. Augustin didn't do much in a starting role, so Mack had the hot hand and was given a few more minutes. He has some short-term fantasy appeal in deeper leagues while Aaron Gordon (hip) is on the mend.

             Hezonja has now posted 20 or more points for just the third time this season, with two of those performances coming over the past five days. He also chipped in with three rebounds and three steals, ending up 8-of-16 from the field with 1-of-5 from behind the 3-point line. Hezonja stayed put at the NBA trade deadline and that appears to be a big relief to him. He has some nice short-term fantasy value while Aaron Gordon (hip) is sidelined, too.

             He had a left shoulder injury down the stretch in the fourth quarter, but he was able to return. Rondo looked fine upon his return and helped his team get this win. He's also been going to the line more with a 3-of-6 today and four attempts on Friday, which puts him one shy of his 6-of-11 in his previous 951 minutes this season. He's been solid for his fantasy owners.

He certainly had his hands full against Giannis Antetokounmpo, Khris Middleton and the Milwaukee frontcourt. He'll look for better results in the team's next game on Monday at Chicago, the penultimate game before the All-Star break.

He also chipped in with a pair of rebounds, an assist and a steal with three turnovers. Fournier appears to be relieved he wasn't dealt at the trade deadline, averaging 20.3 PPG over his past three outings. The Frenchman also has scored in double digits in a team-high 45 games this season. He also has at least one 3-pointer in each of his past 14 outings dating back to Jan. 9.

But he still managed three assists, two rebounds and a steal and he did not turn the ball over. Despite the rather marginal numbers it appears safe to get him back into the active fantasy lineup.

             Zeller was seeing a little extra work with John Henson (hamstring) nursing a hamstring injury and Marshall Plumlee taking a DNP-CD. The newcomer was 2-of-3 from the field, while adding an assist and a blocked shot, making a nice second impression after an ugly debut on Tuesday. Still, his fantasy appeal is rather minimal at this point.

             While he did struggle to make shots, he is completely locked in as the offense runs through him on the vast majority of possessions when he's out there. Dinwiddie actually had 25 potential assists on Wednesday, but his teammates couldn't make shots to get him to 11 dimes against the Pistons. Dinwiddie has to be a candidate for Most Improved Player right now and the Nets reportedly turned down a first-round pick to keep him. He's a starting NBA point guard and he's thriving in a PG-friendly system.

             Coach Kenny Atkinson kept his word that he would give Russell more time with the starters, and Russell did see some of the run in overtime -- he didn't start the OT, though. On the downside, he has some turnover issues right now with 11 over just 49 minutes in his last two games. Russell is playing in back-to-backs now, so hopefully he turns it on after the break.

Harris has registered his second-career double-double (Jan. 16 vs. Boston), and he continues to do more than just shoot the ball. His value will drop once the Nets get healthy, but he has some decent short-term value until the break.

             Terry hit 4-of-7 from the field, including 3-of-5 from behind the 3-point line, and he added just one rebound and no other defensive statistics. The points were nice, and he'll continue to see a decent amount of minutes with Matthew Dellavedova (ankle) on the mend. However, Terry is only worth using in the deepest of fantasy leagues at this juncture.

             Snell hit 1-of-3 from the field, and he added two rebounds with two assists and no turnovers. He isn't asked to do much at the offensive end, even while starting for the injured Malcolm Brogdon (quadriceps). Snell remains a catch-and-shoot specialist with very little offensive upside. He remains useful only in the deepest of fantasy formats at this point.

             Bledsoe also chipped in with a 2-of-3 night from behind the 3-point line while going a perfect 4-of-4 from the free-throw line. He added eight assists with three rebounds and a steal, but it still might be a bit disappointing across 33 minutes. Fantasy owners want to see more, but unless Giannis Antetokounmpo or Khris Middleton are sidelined, it appears Bledsoe is the tertiary scoring option at best.

             Maker made the start with John Henson (hamstring) and Marshall Plumlee out of commission. The big man finished 5-of-8 from the field, including 1-of-3 from behind the arc, while going 2-of-2 from the free-throw stripe. He also chipped in with three rebounds and a blocked shot. When Maker makes the start he is a decent mid-tier DFS option. He also remains a solid stash player in dynasty formats.

             Middleton was pretty sharp, hitting 8-of-13 from the field while posting a 4-of-5 night from the free-throw stripe. He also chipped in with two steals, and about the only thing to complain about might be his five turnovers. The assist and rebound totals were his most since Jan. 20 at Philadelphia. He faces two games in the upcoming week before the All-Star break next weekend.

The only thing fantasy owners might complain about would be his 0-of-1 night from behind the arc and 4-of-7 night from the free-throw stripe. He still fought hard and ended up a plus-11 on the night, best among all players in the game. The Greek Freak has just two games on tap next week with the All-Star break coming up.

             He hit the shot of the game with a fadeaway corner trey with 12 seconds left to tie this game and get it to its first OT. Crabbe is coming off a career-high 34 points from Wednesday, so he's basically too hot to leave on the waiver wire right now. He'll obviously cool off when Rondae Hollis-Jefferson and Caris LeVert return, but maybe he stays hot for a while.

             He was the primary defender against Anthony Davis in the overtime frames and it looked like coach Kenny Atkinson likes him as a five man. Acy will likely be used situationally, so he's only an add in 16-team leagues.

             He had four fouls in the first half, but managed to avoid fouling for most of the second and overtime. Carroll may continue to start at the four until Rondae Hollis-Jefferson is back and not being traded was a big boost to his value.

            Rajon Rondo (left shoulder) went to the locker room with two minutes left in the fourth quarter, but returned in overtime.
        
        
             Spencer Dinwiddie ran into his left shoulder and Rondo did shoot the free throws after the foul. He was grimacing while he stayed in the game, but then walked back to the locker room. He was having a monster game with 22 points, 10 rebounds, 12 assists and three turnovers. It looks like he's OK.

             The team did get to go over some of their system with him and coach Mike Malone talked about it before the game.  ""For him to get comfortable with what were doing and our terminology will be the biggest thing,"" Malone said. ""When hes out there tonight, well keep it simple."" He's only worth a look in deep leagues and he won't affect the starters too much.

             Coach Gregg Popovich joked that he should be allowed to start six guys with Derrick White also as an option -- White will come off the bench. Mills should be looking at huge minutes tonight with Dejounte Murray and Tony Parker out, but he's more of a lukewarm pickup.

             He was on the injury report for a hand injury, but the flu will keep him out for this game.

Kelly Oubre will start and should have a big chance to post a nice stat line.

            Andrew Harrison (illness) is questionable for Sunday against the Thunder.
        
        
             The Grizzlies kept Tyreke Evans, so Harrison will likely be headed back to the bench. He was playing well before the deadline with a career-high 23 points, but he's a drop candidate now.

            Deyonta Davis (right knee, left knee) will not play on Sunday against the Thunder.
        
        
             He probably had the inside track for the backup center minutes with Brandan Wright gone, but this knee soreness will now keep him out for at least three straight games. With him out, it'll be more Ivan Rabb and Jarell Martin getting frontcourt minutes.

            Joel Embiid (ankle) is a game-time decision for Saturday against the Clippers.
        
        
             It's the back end of a back-to-back and Embiid was a GTD on Friday. He was awesome in that easy win over the Pelicans with 16 points in the first quarter alone, but of course Embiid and back-to-backs haven't gotten along for most of his career. He's somewhat healthy, but don't be surprised to see him be held out.

Westbrook's injury hasn't caused much concern, but the Thunder apparently want him to take it easy. Besides his two-year stretch with knee issues, Westbrook has been extremely durably despite his sky-high usage. We'll see if he goes through shootaround tomorrow.

            George Hill will start at point guard in his Cavs debut Sunday vs. the Celtics.
        
        
             LeBron James, Cedi Osman, J.R. Smith and Tristan Thompson will round out the Cavs starting five vs. Boston. Hill's fantasy value receives a nice boost in the move from Sacramento to Cleveland. Hill is shooting 45.3 percent from 3-point range this season, which is the second high percentage in the NBA. He'll get plenty of wide-open looks playing alongside LeBron.

             This is merely a game-notes designation, so we'll wait for a more reliable update. Embiid logged 24 minutes Friday night and has played in both ends of a back-to-back just once in his professional career. If the Sixers choose to rest him on Saturday, Richaun Holmes and Amir Johnson will divvy up minutes at center.

The Bucks may be playing it safe by keeping him out of the back end of a back-to-back. Jabari Parker (rest) is also out Saturday, so Milwaukee will be a bit thin up front.

             Johnson averaged career-lows in points (7.3) and minutes (21.9) in Utah this season. He will see even less playing time in Houston, as the Rockets have plenty of depth in the backcourt and on the wing. It's a smart signing by Houston to add a proven playoff performer in Johnson, but it does not boost Johnson's limited fantasy value.

            Harrison Barnes (left ankle sprain) is probable for Saturday's game vs. the Lakers.
        
        
             Barnes did not play in either of the Mavericks two games this week due to the ankle injury. However, he is on track to return to action Saturday night. He should be locked and loaded into all lineups. Barnes is averaging 18.4 points, 6.6 rebounds and 1.9 assists in 34.7 minutes per game this season.

            Isaiah Thomas will come off the bench when he makes his Lakers debut ?Saturday night against the Dallas Mavericks, according to Chris Hayes of ESPN.
        
        
             ESPN is reporting that coach Luke Walton and Thomas had dinner together in Dallas on Friday and discussed expectations and roles. The plan is for Thomas to eventually work himself into position to join the starting unit, according to ESPN's sources. It will be interesting to see how many minutes Thomas plays over his first few games in L.A. Lonzo Ball (knee) is not expected to return to game action until after the All-Star break, at which point there will be a bit of a logjam at point guard.

             Belinelli was averaging 23.3 minutes per game this season. The Hawks bought him out on Friday. In Friday night's loss to the Cavs, Dorsey logged 23 minutes and finished with 14 points, one rebound, one assist and three 3-pointers. Dorsey can be ignored in standard-sized leagues but is worth keeping an eye on deep formats.

             The Nets acquired Cunningham at the deadline in exchange for Rashad Vaughn. The Nets have been thin up front recently due to the injury to Rondae Hollis-Jefferson (groin) and the trade of Tyler Zeller. RHJ has already been ruled out of Saturday's game, but it is unknown if Cunningham will be cleared to play Saturday vs. the Pelicans. However, Cunningham won't be a fantasy factor going forward and should be left on waivers in all standard leagues.

             Memphis traded Ennis to Detroit in exchange Brice Johnson and a second-round pick on Thursday. The Pistons have plenty of depth on the wing, so it will be very difficult for Ennis to earn consistent enough minutes to become a fantasy factor. He should be left on waivers.

""Were going to see how the ankle feels. It was pretty painful today, but I want to push through everything,"" said Embiid on Friday. ""I really want to push through it and play. Then well go from there."" He played in his first career back-to-back last week. We'll see if the Sixers let him participate in another. We should have an update by Saturday afternoon.

He'll look to keep up the good work Sunday against the Jazz.

            Al-Farouq Aminu went for just five points over 24 minutes in Friday's 118-100 victory in Sacramento.
        
        
             Aminu hit just 2-of-6 from the field and 1-of-4 from behind the 3-point line while adding five rebounds with two steals and no turnovers. That's three consecutive single-digit point totals, and five games in the past six outings with 10 or fewer points. His shot is just not falling right now and his fantasy appeal is limited to deeper leagues at this moment.

             It was the Damian Lillard show, as he dropped 50 points and all of the offense was going through him, with everyone else just watching. Nurk hit 3-of-7 from the field while adding seven rebounds and four assists with no turnovers, so it wasn't a total loss. He was limited to 25 minutes with the game out of hand and the center seeing a lot of rest in the final quarter. He'll be busy Sunday against Rudy Gobert and the visiting Utah Jazz.

             McCollum hit just 5-of-13 from the field, including 1-of-4 from behind the 3-point line, and he did not get to the free-throw line. Damian Lillard was going off for 50 points, so McCollum wasn't needed to do much. He also rested quite a bit in the final quarter with the game out of hand, and that didn't help him much, either. He'll look for better resutls on Sunday night against the visiting Utah Jazz.

             Lillard actually had 50 points through three quarters and obviously did not score in the final quarter, as he was not needed with the Blazers leading by 18 points through 36 minutes. He ended up 8-of-13 from behind the 3-point line while going a perfect 10-of-10 at the free-throw line, and he picked up six assists with three steals and just two turnovers with a plus-18 rating. The 50 points were his most since his final regular season game last April 8 against Utah when he dropped 59.

             Valentine salvaged the fantasy stat line somewhat with four rebounds and two assists while turning it over just twice, but he was 0-of-3 from behind the 3-point line on another poor night. The former Michigan State standout is averaging just 7.3 PPG in three February outings, hitting just 9-of-30 (30.0 percent) from the floor, including a dismal 1-of-13 from behind the 3-point arc.

             Portis hit 4-of-7 from the field, 1-of-2 from behind the 3-point line and 2-of-2 from the free-throw stripe, but he was a minus-10 and he had three personal fouls to limit his minutes. Lauri Markkanen (personal) was back in action, and Robin Lopez was fairly efficient from the field, too, so that didn't help Portis. He'll look for better results Saturday night against Washington.

             Grant flirted with the triple-double, making his fantasy owners smile from ear-to-ear along the way. More importantly he did not turn the ball over once in his 38 minutes while hitting 5-of-9 from the field, 1-of-2 from behind the 3-point line and 3-of-4 from the free-throw stripe. He is off to quite the start in February, averaging 12.3 PPG, 6.0 RPG and 6.7 APG over his past three outings.

He has been up and down with just 10.0 PPG in four games in the month of February, and he is averaging just 6.3 RPG and 1.0 APG. Gibson has been struggling at the offensive end, but fantasy owners should stick with him since he has turned in mid-round fantasy value for most of the season.

            Andrew Wiggins finished with 18 points across 37 minutes in Friday's loss at Chicago.
        
        
             Wiggins hit 9-of-14 from the field, but he was 0-of-2 from behind the 3-point line and he didn't get to the free-throw line. He was able to add four rebounds with a blocked shot, but he also turned it over five times and he finished with a game-worst minus-20 rating. It wasn't his best moment of the season. He'll try and redeem himself Sunday evening against the visiting Kings.

            Jimmy Butler finished with a game-high 38 points in Friday's 114-113 loss at Chicago, his first game back in the Windy City since an offseason trade.
        
        
             Butler did all he could to will his team to a win, hitting 11-of-26 from the field, including 3-of-9 from behind the arc, while adding 13-of-15 from the free-throw stripe. He also added seven rebounds, five assists and four steals with just one turnover across 41 minutes. He is in the midst of his most prolific scoring stretch of the season, dropping 30 or more points in three straight outings. He is averaging 32.8 PPG in four outings in the month of February.

             KAT notched a double-double, but he wasn't terribly sharp from the floor. He hit just 3-of-8 from the field, including 0-of-1 from behind the 3-point line, doing most of his scoring (8-of-9) from the free-throw stripe. He also didn't have a blocked shot against Robin Lopez and the Chicago frontcourt. Towns will look for better results on Sunday against the visiting Kings.

             Even with John Henson in foul trouble, Maker didn't really benefit because Tyler Zeller got some minutes as well. Maker is just a stash in dynasty formats.

            Royce O'Neale finished with eight points, seven rebounds, two assists and a blocked shot over 23 minutes off the bench Friday against the Hornets.
        
        
             O'Neale hit 3-of-8 from the field, including 2-of-4 from behind the 3-point line. With Rodney Hood shipped off to Cleveland, and Joe Johnson also out of the mix, it appears O'Neale will see plenty of minutes down the stretch. His ability to play multiple positions also helps his appeal to both his real team and fantasy owners.

             He did have four fouls, so that explains the low minutes. Henson is hitting 59.3% from the line this season, but he's worth owning for his field goal percentage (58.9%), rebounds (6.9) and blocks (1.4). We'll see how his hamstring holds up on the second night of a back-to-back vs. Orlando on Saturday.

             TJ got the start, but there's no guarantee that it sticks. The Heat already have enough mouths to feed as it is, and Dwyane Wade will complicate things as well. This was Johnson's best game in a while and he's still just a borderline player to own in standard leagues.

             Favors was playing in his 475th game for the Jazz, passing Matt Harpring and Mehmet Okur for 15th place in all-time games played in team history. He also added an assist, a blocked shot and a steal. The milestone game was nice, but that's about the only good story from Friday's game. He has back-to-back single-digit scoring performances for the first time since Dec. 13-15. He'll look to get back on track Sunday in Portland.

             Wade entered the game to a roaring applause and helped the Heat snap a five-game losing streak. ""When D-Wade came in, the energy changed,"" Goran Dragic said. Miami is more than happy with their starting backcourt of Dragic and Josh Richardson and both Tyler Johnson and Wayne Ellington will have big roles, so there's not much fantasy appeal here for Wade.

We'll leave him off the injury report for now, but this is something to keep an eye on going forward. The good news is that he gets a few days off before Tuesday's game vs. Toronto.

             Gobert also chipped in with 11 rebounds, three assists and two blocked shots, but perhaps his biggest contribution in the game was completely shutting down Dwight Howard. Not only was Howard 2-of-7 from the field for five points, but the Stifle Tower managed to foul Howard out after just 21 minutes. Gobert will look to frustrate the Trail Blazers on Sunday night in Rip City.

             Rubio checked out due to left hip soreness, and he appears to be in considerable pain at halftime. Joe Ingles and Donovan Mitchell stepped up and filled the void with Rubio ailing. There was no update after the game, so he'll be re-evaluated on Saturday. If Rubio cannot go on Sunday in Portland it would mean more offensive responsibilities for Ingles, as well as for Mitchell.

             Dwyane Wade is back in town and immediately played 22 minutes, so Ellington could lose a bit of playing time. He's still a huge piece of the puzzle in Miami and his floor spacing is crucial, especially if the Heat are going to keep playing Bam Adebayo next to Hassan Whiteside for stretches. Ellington is worth owning as one of the best source of triples in fantasy basketball.

He also posted six assists, five rebounds and a blocked shot, stepping up his game to help make up for the loss of Ricky Rubio midway through the game due to a sore hip. If Rubio needs to sit Sunday in Portland then Ingles could see more offensive responsibilities.

             Coach Erik Spoelstra finally delivered on his promise to play Adebayo next to Hassan Whiteside, as the duo logged 10 minutes next to each other. Bam finished 3-of-7 from the field and knocked down 9-of-10 free throws, and he also showed off his versatility guarding Giannis Antetokounmpo. The Heat have a gem on their hands and he's been trending up for a while, so he's worth adding if you need a big. It's still unclear how long Kelly Olynyk (shoulder) will be out.

            Donovan Mitchell finished with 25 points across 39 minutes in Friday's 106-94 win against the visiting Hornets.
        
        
             Mitchell was leaned upon in the second half for more offense, as Ricky Rubio checked out of the game due to a sore hip. Mitchell hit 8-of-21 from the floor, including 3-of-10 from behind the 3-point line, while adding 6-of-7 from the free-throw line. He also snagged six rebounds with three assists and a blocked shot. After a two-game stretch with just 11 points, with his production tamped down due to illness, he appears to be back. That's great news to fantasy owners.

             It just wasn't his night. His only make was a 38-footer at the end of the third quarter, but at least the minutes were still there. The glory days of Rozier being a starter are over, but he could still have some value with Marcus Smart (hand) out until the All-Star break.

Lamb has been fairly productive off the bench lately, averaging 11.7 points, 3.5 rebounds and 1.5 steals over the past six outings. He's a decent play in deeper fantasy formats.

Kaminsky is averaging 11.8 points, 3.6 rebounds and 2.4 assists over five games in the month of February.

             The Celtics were trailing by 21 points entering halftime, but clawed their way back into the game with a 34-17 third quarter. They ultimately fell short by six points, giving Boston their second loss in their last three games. As for Irving, he'll get his first shot at taking on the new-look Cavaliers on Sunday. The last time these two teams met, Irving was held in check for one of the few times this season, scoring 11 points on 5-of-14 shots.

             Howard got into foul trouble early, as Rudy Gobert and Derrick Favors proved to be too much for the veteran. He salvaged the fantasy stat line somewhat by posting nine rebounds, but he was also held without a blocked shot. He'll try to bounce back against Jonas Valanciunas and the visiting Raptors on Sunday afternoon back in the Queen City.

It was a major step back after he dropped 40 in Portland on Friday night, but at least he made up for the lack of scoring with more boards and dimes.

             Monroe had five points, six rebounds, two assists and two steals in 20 minutes in his first game, but Aron Baynes (21 minutes) and Daniel Theis (18 minutes) both played more minutes tonight. Monroe turned down the chance to start in New Orleans for a chance at a title in Boston, but it looks like that move will cost him dearly in terms of fantasy value. He might have a nice game here and there because coach Brad Stevens plays the matchups, but standard-league owners can probably do better.

             Turner was coming off two duds in a row with a combined six points in those games, but he was on the injury report with a sore right knee for both of those. Indiana had four days off with their game getting postponed on Wednesday, so Turner likely benefitted from having some fresh legs tonight. He's been banged up a lot and has been a hit-or-miss fantasy asset, but we're expecting big things after the break and the time off should do him wonders.

             The veteran forward added one steal and one triple in 34 minutes, hitting 5-of-10 shots and 2-of-2 free throws. Young was considered a trade candidate since he has a $13.7 million player option for 2018-19, but Indiana's willingness to stick with him is a great sign as they look to make a return to the postseason. He's inconsistent and struggles from the line, but he'll continue to be a nice source of points, rebounds and steals going forward.

             Despite the poor stat line, Joseph played some nice defense on Kyrie Irving and drew some praise from coach Nate McMillan. ""I thought Cory played about as good defense as you can play on Kyrie, just trying to stay in front of him, making hustle plays,"" McMillan said. Joseph added that he had ""no legs"" offensively, but things should get easier on Sunday in New York. He's still just a low-end add while Darren Collison (knee) is out, but owners in standard leagues can probably do better.

             This was his ninth game of the season with 30+ points and his most shot attempts in a single game. Dipo added 10 rebounds for his second double-double of the campaign, adding two assists, two triples and five steals. He had a spinning drive that put Indiana ahead 91-85 with 1:30 left and did all this while still feeling the effects of the flu. ""Not at all,"" Dipo said when asked if he had his normal stamina.  ""But when you're out there playing, you don't think about anything else but the game."" He'll have 48 hours to recover before Sunday's favorable matchup vs. the Knicks.

             Coach Mike Malone said he wanted to limit Harden at the free throw line, but that didn't happen with 11 attempts in just 28 minutes. Harden received some MVP chants and it's becoming a very tough argument to make a case for anyone else. The Rockets are just 0.5 games behind the Warriors and they have the tiebreaker, so things are looking up as the possible top seed. Additionally, Bovada gave the Rockets the best odds to land LeBron James next season.

            Clint Capela pulled down a career-high 25 boards against the Nuggets on Friday, adding 23 points and two blocks in just 29 minutes.
        
        
             The Brinks trucks that were probably going to have to go to Isaiah Thomas' house this summer were likely redirected to Mr. Capela's residence. The last three Rockets to post his numbers from tonight in a single game were Dwight Howard, Hakeem Olajuwon and Moses Malone, so Capela is in some elite company. He's looking like a great bet for Most Improved Player and his fantasy owners cleaned up with his mid-round ADP. He'll be getting a high-round ADP next season.

            Ricky Rubio (left hip soreness) is questionable to return to Friday's game vs. the Hornets.
        
        
             He's in the locker room getting evaluated and we should have an update soon. Rubio has been on fire recently, but this doesn't sound too serious for now. If he does miss time, Donovan Mitchell will run the offense even more, while Joe Ingles and Raul Neto would benefit as well.

             He was back after missing Wednesday's game. Considering how he's had a back injury in almost every season this decade, it's nice to see he's not going to miss extended time. The Rockets do have a back-to-back set coming up on Tuesday, so it's possible the Rockets will hold him out -- Wednesday against the Kings makes sense. He's more of a low-end hold as a specialist.

             Detroit's 5-game winning streak came to an end and Griffin is no longer undefeated with his new team (he was previously 4-0). It wasn't his best game and he did settle for some shots, finishing 7-of-19 from the field, 4-of-5 from the line and 1-of-7 from deep. After the game, Griffin went straight to the locker room and didn't acknowledge his former teammates, so this was clearly one he wanted. As for his fantasy value, he's cruising right now with averages of 21.0 points, 7.8 rebounds, 6.2 assists, 0.6 blocks, 0.6 steals and 1.4 triples in his first five games.

            Ryan Anderson came off the bench on Friday with nine points, two rebounds, two assists, one block and three 3-pointers in 30 minutes against the Nuggets.
        
        
             That playing time is a very encouraging sign after he missed Wednesday's game. Anderson's injury was never considered serious, so this confirms sitting out vs. Miami was a precaution. Still, Anderson is not playing well enough to be held in standard leagues.

            Jamal Murray scored six points with one rebound, two assists and three turnovers in 25 minutes against the Rockets on Friday during a 130-104 loss.
        
        
             You can pretty much just throw this one out with the entire first unit struggling. The Nuggets got destroyed in the first and third quarters, so coach Mike Malone pulled his whole first unit in the middle of the third. Interestingly, Murray reportedly did not look good in his pregame work, so hopefully it was just a one-time thing. The Blue Arrow has been a fantasy stud this season.

             Coach Mike Malone pulled all of his starters in the third quarter because of the blowout, so that allowed Lyles to eat. He's cooled off considerably since his hot December, so he's only a borderline hold depending on who is on your wire.

             It's nice to know that Bullock takes revenge games seriously. He led both teams in minutes played tonight, adding five rebounds and two assists. The Pistons used an 8-man rotation tonight and Luke Kennard still doesn't appear to be a threat, so Bullock is locked into heavy minutes on the wing. Since missing a game on Jan. 24 with a thumb issue, Bullock has been sneaky good with 14.5 points, 3.8 rebounds, 2.1 assists, 0.8 steals and 3.1 triples. He has to be owned right now.

             Are the Cavs fixed? Kidding aside, LeBron has been unbelievable as a passer lately with gem and 15 dimes on Wednesday -- he also had a whopping 22 potential assists in that win over the Wolves. This was LeBron's 10th triple-double of the season and 65th of his career, and the Cavs offense has hit on all cylinders over the last two games. Obviously LeBron's numbers will not be affected by anyone around him, so expect him to thrive around his new teammates when they arrive. He gets Kyrie Irving on Sunday.

             He got hot in the third quarter with his 12 helping the Cavs put this game out of reach with those 36 team points in 13 minutes -- he also had 28 points in his first 22 minutes. Korver's role is unclear right now as he'll have to compete for shots/minutes with Rodney Hood, George Hill and Jordan Clarkson. Korver was productive with 14 points on Wednesday, but he's still not really most fantasy owners should add. If you started him in DFS or as a stream tonight, pat yourself on the back.

He also nailed both of his free throws, a nice surprise considering he was 62.1% from the line coming into tonight's game. Harrell can be productive off the bench with 14+ points in three out of his last four games, but he's only averaging about 18 minutes per game in that span. He's just a deep-league asset and lost most of his stash appeal when the Clippers stood pat at the deadline and kept DeAndre Jordan.

Green was also the hero with his dime to LeBron James against the Wolves. Still, he's not much of a fantasy add until he can prove it with a full roster.

            Avery Bradley scored 10 points with eight rebounds and nothing else in 28 minutes vs. his former Pistons on Friday.
        
        
             Needless to say, the Pistons didn't have a tribute video for him in his first trip back to Little Caesars Arena. His eight rebounds were a season-high, but he has really fallen off in that category -- he grabbed 8+ rebounds 17 times last season. He's averaging 10.0 points, 6.0 rebounds, 2.0 assists and 1.0 steals in his first three games with the Clippers, and he's yet to hit a 3-pointer on seven attempts. He's a low-end fantasy asset, but there might be someone better on your wire.

             No trip to the Dagobah System needed for this Cedi. Osman's play on Wednesday was reportedly part of the reason why Dwyane Wade, was sent to Miami, and it paid immediate dividends. As great as he's been, he'll have some serious competition coming in the form of Rodney Hood, Jordan, Clarkson, Larry Nance and George Hill. He'll probably be sticking in the rotation, but he's only a deep-league flier until we see him do it with a full roster.

             Williams also hit 8-of-9 free throws, adding six assists, four rebounds, two steals, four triples and four turnovers in 31 minutes. Williams just recently signed a three-year extension worth $24 million that includes a team option for a third season, an absolute bargain for a player that could've easily been selected to the All-Star game. ""It was nice for the organization to commit to me the same way I've committed to these guys this year,"" Williams said. He has top-20 value in 9-category leagues for the past month and could hold early-round value the rest of the way unless the Clippers start to slide in the standings. His fantasy owners should be thrilled he wasn't traded.

             He was carving up the Cavs in the first half, but the Hawks fell apart in the third quarter to get this game to garbage time. Schroder was called probable for a back issue, but it didn't seem to be bothering him. The Hawks are in the mix for the top spot in the lotto, so hopefully they don't go DNP heavy to finish the season.

Fox is technically the only healthy point guard on the roster, so it'll be interesting to see who backs him up. If he can stay healthy, Fox could be big time.

             Not many players are as slump prone as Mirotic and he may be in one now, making just 7-of-23 in his last two games. His minutes are still going to be in the mid 30s and he'll be getting his shots with a ton of open looks. He's certainly worth owning, but he'll have his share of bad games like this one.

             He's probably on the 2017-18 Mount Rushmore for most brutal slumps, and he somehow missed all nine attempts from deep today. Prince's 0-of-9 from deep today puts him in a six-way tie for most attempts without a make this season (Kemba Walker, Eric Gordon, Tim Hardaway Jr, Wes Matthews, Robert Covington). We've said it way too many times, but Prince's slumps aren't enough to cap his upside. He's still a hold as a very annoying fantasy player.

             It's surprising to see him play 32 minutes right away, but maybe Doc was rewarding him for doing all of his chores. All kidding aside, Rivers drew the start at PG with Milos Teodosic (foot) out, but it's currently unclear if the veteran was rested or if this injury could linger. He's worth a look and will probably see heavy minutes at both guard spots even when Teodosic is back.

             The good news was his playing time was back up from 15 minutes on Thursday, so maybe he can still flirt with minutes in the low 20s. However, the Hawks have their eyes on 2018-19, so Ilyasova's upside will be capped severely. For the third day in a row, a report came out that he doesn't want to be bought out, so don't expect a sudden surge in value either.

             He was unstoppable in the first quarter with 16 points and six boards, and he became the first 76er this season to score at least 20 minutes in the first half (he scored 19 in a previous game). Embiid was questionable for this game due to an ankle issue, but he sure looked healthy today. He does have a back-to-back set against DeAndre Jordan, so his owners will want to look out for news on that one. Only playing 24 minutes probably helps his cause.

            Dario Saric scored 24 points with five rebounds, four assists and four 3-pointers in 29 minutes against the Pelicans on Friday.
        
        
             He's been outstanding for most of the season and the 76ers needed it a lot more than they thought coming into the season. Markelle Fultz (shoulder) has a very good chance to miss this season, which is very good news to keep Saric playing around 30 minutes per night.

            Anthony Davis scored 14 points with eight rebounds, one steal and no turnovers during a 100-82 loss to the 76ers on Friday.
        
        
             It was one of his worst games on defense with Joel Embiid giving him the business in the first half. Worse news is the Pelicans have now dropped three in a row and now they're on the outside looking in for the playoffs with the Clippers passing them. Plus, the Jazz are red hot and are probably going to pass them soon to bump them to 10th. It's not panic time for AD by any stretch, but his owners would like for him to win more games to keep his game log high.

             He was really the only one to show up on defense in the first quarter as the Pelicans fell behind 32-14 after one. Holiday has been one of the more consistent players in the league and he's a decent bet for 20 points per game in the rest of the way with loaded stat lines. Regardless of if Rajon Rondo comes off the bench, Holiday will get his in the post-Boogie era.

             The Pelicans look like they'll be giving him some time for now and he was getting run as a backup in the first half. For Diallo to have value, he'll either need an injury or for coach Alvin Gentry to tighten up his rotation. He's only a handcuff for Anthony Davis owners in super deep leagues.

             This was probably not the best idea to bring Rondo off the bench, but it's not foreign territory to him with 27 games off the bench last season -- he started every game he played in the previous 10 seasons. Rondo will probably be back in the starting unit soon, but he only has low-end fantasy upside as an assists specialist. Also, he was 1-of-4 from the line tonight after going 6-of-11 in his previous 951 minutes this season.

             Don't let the playing time fool you because this was all about the garbage time in a 100-82 loss. Miller's playing time will likely be closer to 20 minutes most nights, which won't give him enough value in most leagues.

             Yeah, this lineup probably won't last long. It makes sense to start a defense-first player next to the other four starters, but doesn't Darius Miller make more sense? Either way, you're not adding Liggins in almost any league.

             He's had two really bad games since Nikola Mirotic showed up and it's fairly clear his value will be going down after a big 26-point game just before Mirotic showed up. Moore is probably someone you should drop to add a post-deadline winner.

             Milos Teodosic (foot) is out, but we'd still expect some restrictions for Rivers right out of the gate. There are a lot of mouths to feed in LA, but Rivers is worth a look if you need a guard.

            According to Memphis reporter Michael Wallace, the Grizzlies could buy out the remainder of Brandan Wright's contract.
        
        
             With the Grizzlies going nowhere this season and Wright hitting free agency this summer, this would make sense for both sides. Wallace adds that Wright would likely join a playoff-bound team if he's bought out, but he'd likely have a limited role wherever he lands. Expect the Grizzlies to take an extended look at all of their young bigs going forward.

             He was surprisingly held out on Wednesday after he was first called probable to return for Tuesday's game. Anderson isn't the most durable player and the Rockets have depth behind him, so they must feel comfortable he's fine. He's only a low-end hold in 12-team leagues.

             Barring a setback in warmups, Ellington will be ready to return after a one-game absence. He was in a bad slump, but maybe the shoulder had something to do with it. If you need 3-pointers, Ellington is as good of a specialist as you will find.

             Gordon's back injury was never really considered serious, but he does have quite a history of back problems. The Rockets may want to ease him back into action for this game, but Gerald Green, Luc Mbah a Moute and P.J. Tucker will be losing minutes. Gordon is only a lukewarm hold as a specialist in shallower leagues.

             The Cavs won't have their new-look roster at full strength today with Rodney Hood and George Hill also out. Clarkson is going to have more talent around him in what should be a second-unit role, so his fantasy value may be taking a hit. Plus, he is less likely to close games.

ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski said the Thunder, Spurs and 76ers tried to obtain him at the deadline and they do have a roster spot, so they are the likely landing spots for the sharpshooter. He wouldn't have much value on those teams, though. Tyler Dorsey gets a bump with this news.

             All players involved in a trade have to pass their medicals before any of them can play, but Iman Shumpert won't have his until Saturday. That means Hill's debut won't be until Sunday vs. Boston. Hill is an 85th percentile defender against PNR ball-handlers this season according to Synergy and should give Cleveland's woeful defense a boost. He's a solid pickup for his points, triples, dimes and steals.

             They are waiting for Iman Shumpert to complete his physical, so they are not cleared to play yet. Hood is in an interesting spot and he may be a nice offensive fit next to Jordan Clarkson in the second unit. His value likely takes a hit, but he may still be able to hold around top 100-120 value in standard leagues.

             It's the front end of a back-to-back set, so that may explain this one. Teodosic has been held in check since his plantar fascia injury back in October, so expect the Clippers to continue to limit him until at least after the break. With him out, Austin Rivers should help out and maybe Tyrone Wallace gets minutes.

            Austin Rivers (ankle) said he's playing vs. Detroit on Friday.
        
        
             The team also confirmed he is available to play. This has been his target date all along and he's been progressing for over a week now. Rivers may be coming off the bench because now he's got some competition for minutes with Avery Bradley around. Rivers is still worth a look in most leagues, but pickups like George Hill or D.J. Augustin offer more upside.

             He was considered as one of the top second-round picks last year, but McCaw has regressed this season. He has said all the right things about the demotion, so hopefully he comes back a better player. He'll be smashing the G League competition.

             He'll be going through warmups and a decision will be made after that. The 76ers start a back-to-back set tonight, so it may make sense to sit him out this evening. If he's out, Richaun Holmes and Amir Johnson will be logging the center minutes.

             The Blazers should be OK without him because of Moe Harkless stepping up recently. After coach Terry Stotts teased us with more Napier minutes, it's faded away. He doesn't have much value.

             Coach Stan Van Gundy is very familiar with Nelson from their Magic days, so it's possible Nelson picks up the system very quickly. It'll be either Nelson, Langston Galloway or Dwight Buycks backing up Ish Smith, but it's too risky to use those three in fantasy leagues.

             The artist formerly known as The Grindfather is probably only going to be viewed as a locker room presence these days. He'll latch on to a contender at some point, but he's not a good bet to get consistent rotation minutes.

             You're not alone, Tyreke. He also said he ""definitely"" wanted to be on a playoff team, but he was talking about that overall and not specifically this season. The Grizzlies are headed for a high lottery pick, and it'll be interesting to see how they treat Evans. Plus, Evans getting more playing time with the Grizzlies may not help his free agency value this summer, especially considering his injury history. That said, his fantasy owners got lucky the Grizzlies sat on their hands at the deadline, so he's a must-start option in all leagues.

With Murray and Parker out, it should be Patty Mills, Bryn Forbes and Derrick White getting some extra minutes. If you wanted to drop Murray because you need games right now in a shallower league, it's an option.

Not having a practice likely means he's out Saturday and there's a good chance he's out until the break.

On the other hand, Tyler Dorsey has basically stepped into Belinelli's role and should play in the upper 20s. He's worth a look in deep leagues.

            George Hill, Jordan Clarkson and Rodney Hood are not expected to play on Friday.
        
        
             The Cavs committed some major money to these guys, so they'll be playing once active. Hill is a terrific fit in the offense, posting a 47.1 percentage on catch-and-shoot treys to help him be a 98th percentile scorer in both spot-up and hand-off plays. Injury concerns aside, he should be owned in standard leagues.

             Presumably, he'll be in the starting lineup with Rondae Hollis-Jefferson already ruled out. Acy could be giving way to rookie James Webb III while DeMarre Carroll is going to play a lot of four, too. Acy's upside isn't high enough to add in even 16-team leagues.

             LeVert was initially injured on Tuesday in a violent collision with Rockets' center Nene, and was unable to play Wednesday. Fortunately, according to Brain Lews of the New York Post, LeVert is ""fine from the concussion point of view."" It's simply the knee issue that is keeping him sidelined. Joe Harris, Nik Stauskas and D'Angelo Russell will divvy up additional minutes in LeVert's absence.

             This will be the seventh straight game Gordon has missed, and it's not encouraging that he keeps getting ruled out a day ahead of each contest. After Saturday, the Magic have just two more games before the All-Star break. With the team in tank mode, they may very well choose to keep him out until after the break, which would give him an extra nine days of rest. Mario Hezonja has been the primary beneficiary in Gordon's absence. Hezonja is averaging 14.0 points, 5.3 rebounds, 2.3 assists, 2.7 treys and 1.2 steals in 27.5 minutes over Orlando's last six contests.

             Evans has not played since Jan. 29th, as the Grizzlies sat him out in hopes of dealing him before the trade deadline. However, they were unable to find a team willing to move a first-round pick. Evans staying in Memphis is arguably the best-case scenario for fantasy value. He will continue to post a high usage rate as the lead playmaker and scorer in Memphis. Evans currently ranks 41st overall in nine-category leagues this season.

             This was expected, as all players involved in the three-team megadeal need to pass physicals before the trade is officially completed. Crower had seen his fantasy value hit rock bottom in Cleveland, so there is a chance it increases in Utah. However, he will have to compete for minutes with Joe Ingles, Royce O'Neale and Derrick Favors.

             Based on Malone's comments, we can infer that Harris will not play Friday vs. Houston. When he does suit up, Harris will likely provide some decent minutes off the bench, but not enough to be a fantasy asset. He can be left on waivers.

Morris was able to play Thursday, but wore a wrap around his left thumb and wrist in that contest. We'll consider Morris questionable for Saturday's game vs. the Bulls. Mike Scott and Jason Smith would see an uptick in minutes if Morris is unable to play.

             There's probably an outside chance that D Wade gets a pretty decent ovation when he first checks into the game. While Wade's homecoming is a great story, his fantasy value doesn't get a significant boost with his move back to Wade County. The Heat have plenty of depth at shooting guard, assuming Wayne Ellington (shoulder) is healthy. Wade is likely looking at around 20 minutes per night, even if he eventually moves into the starting lineup.

             Ellington did not play Wednesday vs. the Rockets but was able to get some shots up at Thursday's practice. This is shaping up as a game-time decision. The Heat added Dwyane Wade and Luke Babbitt at the deadline, which limits Ellington's upside over the second half of the season. Both Wade and Babbitt will be available to play Friday vs. Milwaukee.

            The Bulls have officially waived G/F Tony Allen.
        
        
             Allen was acquired on February 1 in a trade with the New Orleans Pelicans, but was never part of the Bulls plans going forward. Allen will look to join a contender that gives him a chance to compete for a title. Even at 36 years of age, he can still bring perimeter defense to the table. However, his fantasy value is nonexistent and he should be left on waivers in all formats.

             It was assumed that Johnson would seek a buyout as soon as it was announced that he had been traded to the downtrodden Kings. Plenty of title contenders will be in the market for the proven vet, who has performed well in the postseason throughout his career. The Rockets are reportedly one of the favorites to land Iso Joe.

             Embiid is dealing with a right ankle issue, and it's also noteworthy that Friday night is the front end of a back-to-back for the Sixers. Embiid was cleared last week to play in the first back-to-back of his career, but it's unknown if Philadelphia will continue to play him on consecutive nights for the rest of the season. If Embiid is fighting through a nagging ankle injury, they may choose to err on the side of caution. If Embiid is ruled out, Amir Johnson and Richaun Holmes will divvy up minutes at center.

            Sixers GM Bryan Colangelo said on Friday that there is possibly that Markelle Fultz (shoulder) returns soon, but that ""there is a chance"" that Fultz will not play again this season.
        
        
             Here is the full quote from Colangelo when asked about Fultz' availability: ""There's always a chance that he's going to be out there soon, and there's a chance that he's not gonna play this year. I can't answer that question because we don't know the answer to that."" Fultz's injury and rehab have been a mess since day one, and it doesn't appear there has been a substantial improvement over the last couple of weeks. Stay tuned for a further update. It seems safe to leave him on waivers in standard-sized re-draft leagues.

             Jackson was given a 6-8 week timetable back in late December, so there was hope he'd be cleared to play after the All-Star break later this month. However, it now looks like early March is a more realistic target date. Ish Smith will continue to start at point guard, with the newly acquired Jameer Nelson backing him up.

             The Pistons acquired both players prior to Thursday's deadline. All players involved in the deals need to complete physicals for the trades to become official. We should have an update on their status by Friday afternoon. If they are available to play, it's very unlikely they would see anything more than spot minutes, as they haven't had a chance to familiarize themselves with the team and the Pistons playbook, etc.

             It appears the Frye will stick with the Lakers, as opposed to being bought out. The Lakers have plenty of depth along their frontline, which will make it difficult for Frye to earn consistent minutes over the second half of the season. He can be left on waivers.

             KCP's likely to take a hit once Isaiah Thomas is in town and Lonzo Ball is healthy because there's a good chance he's out of the starting lineup. Although, it's important to note that KCP shares the same agent as LeBron James, Rich Paul, so maybe the Lakers wouldn't want to do anything negative to someone who would influence LeBron. If you want to sell high on KCP, now looks like the time.

This was his first single-digit scoring outing since January 12, but wed expect a bit of a bounce-back performance on Friday.

            Marvin Williams (ankle) looked fine in his return from a four-game absence on Thursday, tallying 10 points, two 3-pointers, four rebounds, one assist, two blocks and two turnovers in 23 minutes.
        
        
             The ankle looked like a complete non-issue for Williams, and considering he only played 23 minutes, he should be fine for Fridays game in Utah. He was one of just two players to hit at least 50 percent of his shot attempts for Charlotte (Kemba Walker was the other guy), and tonights stat line was a pretty good representation of what we can expect from Williams on a nightly basis. Hes just a low-end guy, but he doesnt really hurt you anywhere.

             The Hornets got off to a horrible start in this one, going just 7-of-23 from the field through the first quarter of action, and Batum was part of that efficiency problem. Some of that was due to some stingy defense from the Trail Blazers, but he also missed a handful of wide-open looks. It wasnt all bad though, as Batum still contributed one 3-pointer, two rebounds, five assists and four steals while he was out there.

             Walker took over down the stretch, rocking an insane 65.8 usage rate through the fourth quarter of action as he scored 15 straight points to force overtime. He was also a perfect 8-of-8 from the charity stripe to give him a sterling 67.8 true shooting percentage, and he was phenomenal on the defensive end of the floor, holding Damian Lillard to just 6-of-22 shooting. He was named Kristaps Porzingis (knee) replacement in the All-Star game today, and it's obvious why.

             Harkless remained in the starting five despite the return of Evan Turner (calf), but that move might have been made to conserve Turners minutes. Harkless had a nice 19-point showing through 31 minutes of action on Sunday, but hes done a whole lot of nothing ever since.

             Aminu went 2-of-7 from the field and 1-of-2 from the stripe, more or less making this your prototypical Aminu line. He won't do much for you in the scoring department, and his shooting percentages often aren't pretty, but he can chip in enough triples, boards, dimes and steals to preserve his late-round value. He is what he is.

             This was a solid bounce-back performance for Nurkic, who struggled through 26 minutes of action on Monday, and the Blazers did a nice job of getting him involved early on. He went to work against Dwight Howard in the post, fearlessly attacking him on offense and giving him the business on the defensive end of the floor. He did, unfortunately, cough up the rock seven times, but it's tough to complain much when he's offering up stat lines like these.

             Turner said prior to the game that he expected to be on a 15-20 minute limit, as the calf had been bothering him over the past 10 days, and he did appear to be wincing a bit throughout the game. The Blazers take on the 17-36 Kings on Friday in the second game of this back-to-back set, so owners might want to confirm Turner's status prior to tip-off, as it wouldn't be terribly shocking to see him sit that one out.

             Coach Luke Walton wouldn't say how much Isaiah Thomas would play. There was some talk that Thomas wants to start for the Lakers, and presumably he'll get his chance to while Lonzo Ball (knee) is out. When Ball is back, it's going to be very tough for IT to hold the starting job at the point -- Kentavious Caldwell-Pope could also move to the bench. Thomas' fantasy value improves while he's active with the Lakers.

             Portland got off to a solid start, opening the game with a 20-5 run, but some sloppy turnovers during the second half helped Charlotte stay in the game and force an overtime period. McCollum is typically much better with the rock, but Nicolas Batum did a good job of pressuring him and forcing him to make tough decisions. He should be better on Friday in Sacramento.

He's still not a great rebounder and Julius Randle is still the guy, but Bro-Lo appears to be coming on with Larry Nance out of the picture.

             To nobody's surprise, the Warriors were not busy at the deadline and didn't make a move today.

""We were never the lead horse in a race in some of the things we looked at,"" Myers said. As for Curry, he's cooled off from his MVP-caliber play, but he's still going to be a top-five player going forward.

            Kevin Durant scored 24 points with nine rebounds, four assists, two blocks, one steal and four 3-pointers in 30 minutes against the Mavs on Thursday.
        
        
             He did not turn the ball over and was the steady hand of the first unit -- all other starters had at least two. Durant's hand was also the story coming into this game after a minor injury to put him on the injury report, but there was never any doubt he'd play.  The Warriors aren't playing their best right now, so maybe Durant tries to put the team on his back more often. Plus, it's not likely the Warriors rest their players too often, so his fantasy value is looking good.

             George was great, but the Thunder struggled mightily against the Lakers without Russell Westbrook, who was held out with an ankle injury, and OKC has now lost five of their last six games after going on an eight-game winning streak. PG-13 is good to go on any given night, so his performance in this one was a little disappointing, given that Westbrook was wearing street clothes.

             He must like the spotlight because he was really trying to go for a highlight on almost every possession against the champs. Smith Jr. continues to score in double figures, and now his playing time hanging in the mid-30s.  There's are still some holes to his game with his FT% woes, but he's picked it up in several areas to give him a nice fantasy upside.

             According to Basketball Reference, he joins Robert Parish and Michael Jordan as the only players at least 39 years old to put up at least five steals and two blocks. The steals jump out and you can blame that on the Warriors being careless with the ball again. Everyone knows the Mavs will be loyal to Dirk on whatever he wants, and it sounds like he wants to play. He's not the most coveted fantasy property, but he'll be helping a lot of teams in the final two months until further notice.

             Yes, he got a boost without Harrison Barnes around. However, he's really found his rhythm in the starting lineup and had some nice momentum coming into this game, averaging 13.0 points, 9.5 boards, 2.5 dimes, 0.5 blocks and 0.5 steals in his previous two. While the Mavs reportedly want to play Nerlens Noel after the break, don't bet on it. Powell was probably already worth scooping up even before tonight, and tonight will make him an add in 12-team leagues. Doug McDermott shouldn't hurt him.

             He didn't really see much of a boost and that's not much of a surprise. Barea is basically locked in for a role with minutes in the 20s while Dennis Smith Jr. and Yogi Ferrell are active.

             The Mavs wanted a first-round pick, but NBA teams held their firsts like their first borns today. Matthews should see minutes for the next month at least and the Mavs have given no indication they'll cut his minutes. Plus, they don't have much behind him and Devin Harris leaving helps him, too. He should be owned in fantasy leagues.

            Jaylen Brown finished Thursday's OT victory with 18 points on 7-of-16 shooting, four rebounds, three assists, three 3-pointers, one steal and one block in 38 minutes.
        
        
             Brown surfaced in the official game notes as questionable with a left ankle sprain, but it didn't cost him any time. He came in with just one steal and one block in his previous five games, which is anathema in category leagues, so it was nice to see him with a well-rounded line tonight. He's a solid top-100 contributor in points leagues, as well as most formats that toss out his FT shooting (59.3% on 3.2 attempts).

            Greg Monroe made his Celtics debut on Thursday with five points, six rebounds, two assists and two steals in 20 minutes off the bench.
        
        
             Monroe was a nice addition for Boston, providing scoring punch and size in the frontcourt, and this was a solid debut in all respects. It's not an ideal situation for fantasy purposes, but he's capable of posting standard-league value in just 24-26 minutes per game. Anyone who picked up Monroe should hold on and see how he fares over the next week.

             Morris made 3-of-6 field goals and 2-of-2 free throws, with one of his makes coming from downtown. He sprained his left hand in a tussle with Joel Embiid during Tuesday's game and was wearing a brace earlier on Thursday, but it didn't impact his play tonight. Fantasy owners can deploy him as usual.

             Porter logged 40 minutes tonight and he's really stepped up with John Wall (knee) out of commission. Washington's coaching staff has pressed Porter to be more aggressive, and with Wall out he's averaging 18.2 points (53.0% FGs, 88.2% FTs), 1.2 triples, 6.2 boards, 3.8 assists, 1.0 steals and 0.2 blocks. That's fantasy gold and he's been even better in 9-cat with just 1.0 turnovers during that stretch.

            Tomas Satoransky finished Thursday's tough overtime loss vs. Boston with 14 points, four rebounds, four assists, two blocks and one steal in 34 minutes.
        
        
             There were some winners and losers at the trade deadline, but nothing dramatic enough to make you regret clinging to someone like Satoransky. His role is iron-clad with John Wall rehabbing from left knee surgery performed on Jan. 31 -- since that time, Satoransky has put up mid-round value with an emphasis on assists (5.0 per game), steals (2.0) and FT shooting (a perfect 11-of-11). He's a solid fantasy play with Wall out approximately 5-7 more weeks.

             Here he comes again. While garbage time has helped him, Wright has been very productive in his last three, averaging 13.3 points, 3.3 boards, 2.7 assists, 2.7 steals and 1.0 treys on 65.4 percent from the field. We've seen him go on double-digit game streaks of posting third-round value and that's what he's doing in this mini sample right now. He's great in reality and his fantasy floor makes him someone most fantasy owners should consider.

             The supporting stats were nice and Beal made three 3-pointers with just one turnover in 44 minutes during this overtime loss to the visiting Celtics. Opposing defenses can pay more attention to him without John Wall (knee), which tempers any increase in his usage, but fantasy owners should still be satisfied if he maintains his current top-40 pace.

             The Raptors second unit is really good and it's hurting Lowry in two ways. The bench unit continues to add to leads to make garbage time more likely, and that unit has stayed in during the fourth once it gets to that aforementioned garbage time. Still, Lowry will be putting up high-end value as the Raptors go for the No. 1 seed. He won't be as good as last year, though. DeMar DeRozan also didn't do much with eight points, five boards, five assists, one steal, two blocks and one 3-pointer. He's fine.

             His playing time didn't go up too much as Luke Kornet played well behind him, and this game got to garbage time.

""It could be down the line. We don't know,"" said Hornacek. ""We'll see what happens in the next week or so. We have four more games before the All-Star break. We'll continue to monitor that."" He could get better soon, but it's really tough to stash him due to how he's really shown very little to this point.

             It's going to be awfully messy at point guard with Emmanuel Mudiay in the mix now. Burke needs a lot of things to go right and his upside isn't the greatest.

             He played right behind Michael Beasley and it'll be interesting to see if he can continue to see minutes. Hicks didn't exactly have the best game, so he's not really the strongest add. Luke Kornet clearly looks like the better lottery ticket.

             This was not a garbage time special with Kornet getting minutes in the first quarter as Kyle O'Quinn's backup. He's one of the best-shooting seven-footers in the G League and the Knicks gave him a green light with seven attempts from deep -- his jumper is silky smooth. Enes Kanter (mouth) probably won't be out for too long, but Kornet does offer some upside for points, boards, blocks and treys. If you are in a deep league and you hate the guy at the end of your bench, maybe it's time to give The UniKornet a look to see what happens. By the way, shoutout to the Knicks new beat writer Mike Vorkunov for the UniKornet nickname.

             He actually brought the ball up a couple times and he's locked in for big minutes at the four. Aaron Gordon (hip) still has pain and it's becoming more likely he's out until the break. Hezonja should have some nice short-term value, so he's worth a look if you need a boost in the next two weeks.

             While the stat line isn't great, it seems pretty clear Simmons will be running the offense more with Elfrid Payton in Phoenix. He had a lot of high screens set for him to open up the floor, but his teammates couldn't convert on open shots. Simmons has usually been a monster when he's not next to Aaron Gordon and Elfrid Payton, so expect him to have a nice finish to his first season as a Magic.

             It's possible Iwundu does find himself getting more minutes because the Magic probably won't run out as many two-PG combos. He's also benefitted from Aaron Gordon (hip) missing time. Obviously, he's not really worth adding based on averages of 4.4 points, 2.6 boards, 1.4 steals and 0.2 treys over his last five.

             He had a big fourth quarter and his teammates were knocking down many of the shots off his passes. Augustin gave way to some others early in the win, but he was the primary weapon to create offense to help pull off just the 18th win of the season. It's also worth a mention he did play minutes next to Shelvin Mack. He's not going to be this good and his track record isn't the best, but DJA should be added in all standard leagues after this game.

             There was some talk about Schroder possibly getting traded to Phoenix, but the Hawks and Suns couldn't come to terms. The Hawks are sitting in the No. 1 lottery spot with a lot of bad teams right on their tail, so hopefully this won't affect Schroder's playing time too much. He's obviously still a hold in all leagues and should post mid-round value.

             He did a little at shootaround, but the Thunder will just hold Melo out. It doesn't sound serious, so he should be OK for Sunday. We'll see a lot of Jerami Grant, Terrance Ferguson and Josh Huestis today.

            Russell Westbrook (ankle) and Carmelo Anthony (ankle) are out Thursday against the Lakers.
        
        
             This comes as a shock and Westbrook will miss his first game of the 2017-18 season. The TNT broadcast showed Westbrook walking around just fine, so presumably the team is just being very cautious. With him out, we'll see a lot of Raymond Felton at the point. Paul George could have a monster night, too.

            Tyler Dorsey scored 11 points with five rebounds, three assists and one 3-pointer in 25 minutes against the Magic on Thursday.
        
        
             Even though Marco Belinelli wasn't available today, it was a very encouraging day for Dorsey. He even closed this game over Kent Bazemore and he followed up a 29-minute game on Tuesday with solid minutes again. That said, Belinelli should be back soon and Dorsey probably won't get to 20 minutes while the Italian is on the roster. He's more of a 20-team add.

            Ersan Ilyasova scored five points with four rebounds and three turnovers in 15 minutes against the Magic on Thursday.
        
        
             It's not a big surprise that his playing time took a big hit and he did not close today. Ilyasova reportedly doesn't want to be bought out, but maybe that changes in the future. He's been traded a lot in his career, so anyone has to understand his desire to stay put with his family. Fantasy wise, he's looking like a drop with the Hawks looking at their youth more.

            John Collins scored nine points with 12 rebounds, one steal, two blocks and one 3-pointer in 26 minutes against the Magic on Thursday.
        
        
             The Hawks didn't jettison their veterans, but it does look like Collins is going to get more minutes. Even with the Magic going smaller late, Collins closed this game out at power forward and it's possible the Hawks dial back Ersan Ilyasova's minutes. While Collins may not have the upside of Jarrett Allen, we'd expect Collins to flirt with top-100 value going forward.

             He did not close this game, which may have been due to one of his patented duds. It's certainly possible the Hawks do dial back his minutes going forward, but Bazemore should still get run in the mid 20s. He's still a hold in 10-team leagues.

             Even though the Hawks didn't wind up trading away most of their guys, Prince was still a key cog in the rotation with plenty of shots going his way. It was somewhat noteworthy that both Ersan Ilyasova and Kent Bazemore didn't close, so there could be more usage going to Prince the rest of the way. He's been a mess on the year, but he's capable of a big finish to his sophomore season.

Of course, the biggest story about Noel this season was about him eating a hotdog at halftime, so it's far from certain he gets minutes this season.

Lin was always expected to opt in on this deal and he should still have a chance to be the opening night starter even if Spencer Dinwiddie and D'Angelo Russell are on the roster.

The addition of Jabari Parker could slightly hurt Henson because the Bucks could go with more small-ball lineups, but he's still an OK hold as a blocks specialist.

             Beasley is the captain now. The Knicks didn't trade him and now he's looking at a big role with Kristaps Porzingis (knee) out for the season. The Walking Bucket needs to be owned in fantasy leagues.

             Elfrid Payton is gone and coach Frank Vogel will just promote Augustin. It's also important to note that DJA and Shelvin Mack have played together for 254 minutes this season, so there are a lot of wing minutes available. Augustin looks like one of the best adds from the deadline today, so he should be added in 12-team leagues. Shelvin Mack is worth a look in 14-team leagues and Wes Iwundu also benefits.

             According to the report, there's still time for that to change, but if it holds, teams hoping he'd be available after a buyout will be disappointed. Lopez was a sneaky fantasy winner on deadline day because he'll only have Julius Randle taking his playing time, and not Randle and Larry Nance Jr. If he was dropped, go add him.

             Heat president Pat Riley said that Wade will ""probably"" be coming off the bench, but deferred to coach Erik Spoelstra's final decision. Wade is unlikely to log a ton of minutes either way, so it's not a big deal where he begins games for fantasy purposes. His outlook improved with the trade back to Miami, but he's still just a low-end pickup due to DNP concerns and the likelihood of a minute-limit.

We don't have any more details and owners should check for an update after L.A.'s shootaround. If he does miss time, Lou Williams and Avery Bradley should be very busy in the backcourt, potentially aided by the return of Austin Rivers (foot).

             Rivers has been targeting a Feb. 9 return and this is the first time in a while he's been tagged as 'questionable', so maybe we'll see him in action. His fantasy value took a hit recently with Lou Williams signing an extension and Avery Bradley staying in L.A. through the deadline, though, so he doesn't have a ton of fantasy upside.

             Hammons was never a reliable part of the rotation, especially with Bam Adebayo playing so well. This shouldn't impact fantasy owners.

             The final two years are non-guaranteed team options, according to beat writer Eddie Sefko. Collinsworth will spend much of his time in the G League but he could eventually earn some minutes for the last-place Mavs.

             Augustin was already playing well and gets a huge boost with this move, while Mack also gets a lift and more minutes. Augustin is currently averaging 11.8 points, 2.4 rebounds, 3.0 assists, 1.2 steals and 1.8 3-pointers in 24 minutes over his last five games, but those numbers are about to go up. He may not be a must-own player, but if you're thin at point guard and you're waiver wire isn't very meaty, he can help and will be a popular add.

             It was assumed that Memphis would trade Evans, especially once they decided to sit him for the final few games prior to the deadline. However, they were seeking a first-round pick and apparently couldn't find any takers. This is good news for Evans fantasy value this season, as he'll remain in Memphis, where he is an offensive focal point for the shorthanded Grizzlies.

             The Magic have been looking to dump Payton off their roster, and now the Suns will get his rights. The pick is from the Troy Daniels deal in the 2017 offseason, so the Suns aren't giving up much to take a look at Payton. This is a good landing spot for Payton's fantasy value and he'll probably be starting next to Devin Booker. Plus, he'll be even busier while Booker recovers from his torso injuries. The Suns have lost their faith in Tyler Ulis, and Josh Gray shouldn't see a boatload of minutes. On the Magic side, both Shelvin Mack and D.J. Augustin could be getting more minutes at the point with DJA having a higher floor and being worth a look in standard leagues. As of now, it is unknown if Payton will make his Suns debut on Saturday vs. the Nuggets.

             He's racking up some frequent flyer miles with his second trade in a week. Vaughn probably isn't going to play much in New Orleans and they may not even keep him.

            Portland has traded Noah Vonleh and cash to Chicago for the rights to Milovan Rakovic, according to Adrian Wojnarowski on ESPN.com.
        
        
             He's still just 22 years old and has upside as an athletic four man. Of course, the former lottery pick has been on three teams so far and he's seen a number of Blazers take his playing time. This will give the Blazers a trade exception to use today and it helps their luxury tax number for now.

             They went through shootaround, so they're likely closer to probable than questionable. Westbrook looked awesome at Oracle Arena, and we're fully expecting him to play. He has been on a tear lately and OKC's offense has looked as good as it has been since the Kevin Durant days.

             Anthony was able to ""do a little in shootaround"" on Thursday but his status for Thursday night will be determined based on how he feels closer to game time. Jerami Grant and Pattrick Patterson will divvy up extra minutes if Melo is unable to suit up.

             Barnes did practice on Wednesday so this is a bit of a letdown for his fantasy owners. Dallas is likely just playing it safe and that should be a trend the rest of the season, as they currently reside in last place in the Western Conference. Barnes' next chance to play comes Saturday vs. the visiting Lakers.

             Mudiay goes to the Knicks, where he could eventually start at point guard over Jarrett Jack and Frank Ntilikina, Doug McDermott will go from the Knicks to the Mavericks, and veteran Devin Harris will end up in Denver. Mudiay is the youngest and, arguably, best player in this deal, but whether he starts for a team going nowhere remains to be seen. But any way you slice it, Frank Ntilikina took a big hit today and can be dropped in re-draft leagues, while Mudiay is nothing more than a speculative add at this point.

The Mavericks may not be done making moves, but McBuckets will have a decent role off the bench behind Harrison Barnes and Wesley Matthews. He was just a 3-point specialist in deeper fantasy leagues with the Knicks and is likely looking at similar value in Dallas. According to Shams Charania of Yahoo Sports, Dallas is also acquiring a second-round pick from Denver.

             Additionally, Marc Stein of the New York Times says the Wolves could be interested. Rose certainly didn't fit into the system that Utah has established, and obviously Donovan Mitchell thriving in his role means there isn't much of a role anyway. Plus, Dante Exum is getting closer. Someone will likely sign Rose as a backup point guard in the coming days. Maybe he can have value on a team like Phoenix, but leave him on the wire.

            The Cavs have agreed to trade Dwyane Wade to the Miami Heat in exchange for a heavily protected second-round pick, according to Adrian Wojnarowski of ESPN.
        
        
             According to Brian Windhorst of ESPN, The Cavs coaching staff was considering reducing Wade's playing time and he's been agitating for a return ""home"" to Miami in the future. Both those issues are now fixed. The Cavs will re-route the second-round pick they received from Miami to Sacramento to complete an earlier deal. The Heat have plenty of depth at shooting guard, so Wade likely won't see more playing time than he did in Cleveland, which limits his fantasy value.

             It's worth noting that this is not the shoulder that was surgically repaired back in 2016, but shoulder issues have been a common theme throughout Olynyk's career, so it wouldn't be shocking to see him miss a large chunk of time here. Bam Adebayo and James Johnson will divvy up most of Olynyk's minutes, with Johnson offering a bit more upside.

             The Cavs have been looking for a low-usage point guard that can space the floor, and they get their man in Hill. The former King will no longer be getting as much scheduled rest in Cleveland, and he should basically slide into Dwyane Wade's minutes. Hill isn't the strongest add here, but he actually gains value in 12-team leagues. Again, Cleveland is not done.

             As part of a monster deal, Utah will send Rodney Hood to Cleveland and Joe Johnson to Sacramento, and Cleveland will send Jae Crowder and Derek Rose to Utah. Sacramento sends George Hill to the Cavs. The Cavs roster, especially on the wings, has been completely overhauled, as the Cavs also traded Dwyane Wade to the Heat as part of a separate deal.

             Rose hasn't been productive on the court in a long time and we don't see that changing in Utah. With Donovan Mitchell and Ricky Rubio running the offense in Utah, Rose is not worth picking up in most formats. He's expected to be released so that he can pursue a deal with a playoff team.

             The Jazz sent Joe Johnson to Sacramento and Rodney Hood to the Cavaliers, so Crowder does land in a nice spot. Crowder will likely see time at the 3 and 4 in Utah, competing with the likes of Joe Ingles, Royce O'Neale and Derrick Favors. He was terrible in Cleveland, but maybe he benefits from a fresh start. He's on the radar as a pickup, but it's no guarantee that he ever returns to the form he had in Boston.

             There was never a doubt that Hood was headed out of town, and now he'll be going to a team that is almost the opposite of how the Jazz identified itself. Hood was really cruising as an offensive weapon off the bench, and now he'll have to find his rhythm again. He's a fantasy loser on this deal, but hey the Cavs aren't done.

This move also raises questions on if the Pistons have their eyes on something bigger with possibly a Stanley Johnson deal. Ennis isn't much of an add while this helps all the remaining Grizzlies perimeter players.

Thomas is heading into unrestricted free agency and will reportedly be seeking a max deal, but L.A. reportedly hopes to retain him. The Lakers play with the fastest pace in the league, which can only help Thomas, so fantasy owners should be satisfied with his landing spot.

             It's a minor deadline-day trade that gives Miami some welcome perimeter shooting, but doesn't move the needle for fantasy purposes. There's no reason to touch Babbitt in any fantasy leagues.

            Larry Nance has been traded to the Cavaliers.
        
        
             Nance and Clarkson will head to Cleveland in exchange for Isaiah Thomas, Channing Frye and Cleveland's first-round pick. The Cavaliers rank 13th in the NBA in pace, but you'd think that will go up with Nance and JC running the floor. Barring another move (Cleveland is linked to DeAndre Jordan), Nance will compete for minutes with Tristan Thompson and Jae Crowder, but only needs minutes in the 20s to help fantasy owners. He's a solid add, but the deadline could create better pickups.

             And we're off. The Cavs get themselves some much needed help to their backcourt, and chances are they are not done here. Clarkson isn't the best shooter, so he will likely be coming off the bench. Fantasy wise, this is not the best spot for Clarkson because he'll be losing shots to LeBron James and presumably other players, but maybe he can hold value with Isaiah Thomas off the roster.

             Al Jefferson would head to Brooklyn in this rumored deal, but the Pacers would likely have to give up a young player or draft pick to make this work because Carroll does have some value around the league. As for Jefferson, he'd likely be waived if he ended up with the Nets. If Carroll does end up in Indiana, Bojan Bogdanovic would lose some value and Thaddeus Young might too.

             No surprise there because the Cavs really want to keep the Nets pick for next season, and the Hornets aren't going to do it unless they get high picks or high-upside prospects. For now, expect him to be a Hornet for the rest of the season. This could change very soon, of course.

The Raptors would likely need a third team to help facilitate a deal, but if they are serious about adding Jordan, you would think Jonas Valanciunas goes elsewhere. No deal is imminent for now.

Gordon also ruled himself out from the dunk contest, and it's starting to look like he won't be back until after the break either. If Mario Hezonja doesn't get traded, he could have a couple more weeks of value. Wes Iwundu and Mo Speights have benefitted, as well.

            The Suns are expected to add a point guard at the deadline or in the buyout market, according to Arizona Sports 98.7's John Gambadoro.
        
        
             This could mean that Tyler Ulis (back spasms) could be out with his back spasms, or it could be that the Suns are just being cautious. They probably won't be giving up much, but you never know with the Suns. Either way, Ulis doesn't hold strong fantasy value right now.

             The Nets were able to get picks for Carroll from Toronto to take on his salary, but now they may be able to get some back to send him out of town. The Nets are likely going to trade at least one player today, so it's hard to project who to add on a speculative basis. Guys like Allen Crabbe, James Webb III and whoever else stays would benefit.

The guys at Smoothie King Center have already made a splash this month both literally and figuratively, so don't expect any big moves there.

             ""I'm in good condition, but I haven't played 20-plus minutes in a long time,"" Dorsey said. The Hawks are almost certainly trading Marco Belinelli and there could be others heading out of town, so Dorsey could be a guy that gets a nice bump in minutes. He did score 10 points with seven dimes on Tuesday, but he's more of a deep-league add for now until the Hawks start slashing prices like they're having a going out of business sale.

             Irving was likely going to see close to his full allotment of minutes on Tuesday, but the Celtics were run out of the building early. Teams will often list a player as probable for their next game after returning from an injury, so this doesn't mean he suffered a setback. His fantasy owners can deploy him like they normally would.

             This comes from the official game notes and it's not clear when he picked up the injury. Hopefully we'll get an update after shootaround.

            The Spurs and Clippers have discussed a trade involving a first-round pick from San Antonio and Danny Green for Avery Bradley.
        
        
             As of right now, Marc Stein of the New York Times said that the Spurs are hesitant to give up the draft pick. Green has a $10 million player option for 2018-19 and San Antonio might be worried that he'll opt out, while Bradley is set to hit the open market this summer. Green would lose value in this scenario since Lou Williams is in Los Angeles, while Bradley may get a small bump playing for the best coach in the NBA.

            The Nuggets could attach a draft pick to Kenneth Faried in an effort to move him before the deadline.
        
        
             It seems like Faried's name pops up every deadline. It's no secret that the Nuggets would like to move him, as he's clearly behind Trey Lyles and has no path to minutes right now. Plus, Paul Millsap (wrist) is expected back after the All-Star break. He's owed $13.7 million in 2018-19, and while his offensive game is limited, he could be helpful to a playoff-bound team in need of rebounding and energy off the bench. Emmanuel Mudiay and Wilson Chandler are also on the block in Denver.

             Basically, the Pacers are open for business if another team wants to dump a salary on them. Al Jefferson would likely be on the move if that happens, but there's really no fantasy implications here since Myles Turner and Domantas Sabonis are locked in as the No. 1 and No. 2 centers.

This deal could involve a third team as well, but right now Jordan is the only player named in the report. Jordan's fantasy owners shouldn't be too stressed, as a trade  to Cleveland wouldn't be a bad thing for his value since his role would be the same -- defend, rebound and catch lobs.

As far as potential trade whispers heading into the Feb. 8 deadline, Len added, ""Ive heard nothing. Its been quiet."" He'll be an unrestricted free agent this summer and few teams will give up much to rent an off-injured 24-year-old center, but fantasy owners should still monitor him closely through the deadline.

That can be interpreted as a vote of confidence in guys like Jackson, T.J. Warren, Dragan Bender and Marquese Chriss, who played big minutes with even bigger negative net ratings. Efficiency is a concern for Jackson in category-based leagues, but minutes and usage should be plentiful down the stretch.

             Tyler Ulis (back spasms) left early tonight. Devin Booker (hip, ribs) wasn't available. Isaiah Canaan (ankle) is done for the season. The Suns had to turn somewhere, and that turned out to be Gray, a 24-year-old who was called up from the G League last week and found himself at the wrong end of a historically lopsided loss tonight. There is a glaring hole in the Suns' backcourt, but owners should leave Gray on the wire outside of very deep leagues.

             This game was hard to watch and the Suns lost by 48 points, so there's not a lot to glean. Tyson Chandler (neck) was out tonight and is an obvious trade candidate, and Chriss' owners should just hold tight and hope for the best as the Feb. 8 trade deadline passes. Despite recent trade whispers, it sounds like he'll stay in Phoenix. ""I think its highly unlikely we move a member of our young core,"" GM Ryan McDonough said. ""We believe in Marquese, we like his talent, we like his potential.""

            Tony Parker started the second half of Wednesday's game in place of Dejounte Murray (sprained left ankle), finishing with 13 points, four rebounds, two steals and one assist in 27 minutes.
        
        
             Parker recently ceded the job to Murray without any discord, but he was forced back into the starting five due to Murray's injury. For what it's worth, Murray said he's targeting a return vs. the Warriors on Saturday. Parker's fantasy value doesn't really change no matter where he begins games, since San Antonio will always limit his minutes, so there's no incentive to pick him up.

             Dejounte Murray (sprained left ankle) exited tonight's game early after a scary fall. He took his free throws and seems to have avoided serious damage, but we'll keep an eye out for updates in the next 48 hours -- the Spurs aren't going to take any chances with one of their young building blocks. Mills and Tony Parker are the clear beneficiaries if Murray does miss time, so keep an eye on the injury report prior to Saturday's game vs. Golden State.

             A report came out during this game that the Spurs might be interested in trading for Clippers guard Avery Bradley. Green has a $10 million player option for 2018-19, so that might be an indication that San Antonio expects him to opt out and command more in free agency. Owners should simply keep an eye on the situation through Thursday's trade deadline, but the acquisition of any wing players would likely be bad news for Green.

             Anderson's fantasy owners shouldn't read into tonight's quiet line. The Spurs won by 48 points, three shy of the franchise record for the largest margin of victory, and Gregg Popovich wound up playing 13 different players at least 11 minutes. Rudy Gay (heel) is expected back after the All-Star break, but Anderson projects as a mid-round roto option with Kawhi Leonard (quad) out indefinitely.

             Aldridge has led the Spurs in scoring 41 times this season, which is the highest number for any player in the league -- Giannis Antetokounmpo is second at 38 games. He's been an unheralded savior for San Antonio in the absence of Kawhi Leonard (quad), helping them attain the No. 3 seed in the West with a 35-21 record. He's sitting on top-50 value in most fantasy formats, and rises even higher if you value his 49.6% FGs, 83.8% FTs and meager 1.6 turnovers.

             This really isn't a big surprise because it's not like Randle will be fetching a ton of offers this summer. The Lakers are also expected to push back their big free agent push until 2019, so that also makes it less likely he's dealt. For now, expect him to stay put and hold decent fantasy value. We'll see if Brook Lopez gets dealt today.

             Bertans logged 26 minutes in a runaway road win vs. the Suns. The Spurs were so good that it's hard to envision Gregg Popovich changing his starters for Saturday's game vs. the Warriors, but he wouldn't commit to Bertans starting over Pau Gasol long-term. As long as the Spurs' frontcourt veterans are healthy, Bertans belongs on the wire in most fantasy formats.

             Gregg Popovich still won't commit to making Pau a full-time reserve this season. When asked if he'd stick in that role, Pop replied, ""It will be that way tonight."" Gasol was averaging a modest 25.2 minutes as a starter this season, so if he can stick in the 22-26 range off the bench his value shouldn't change much -- he could even tick upward if his usage increases against opposing bench units.

            Jimmy Butler scored seven of his 35 points in overtime on Wednesday, finishing 14-of-21 from the field with six assists, five rebounds, four 3-pointers and two steals in 46 minutes.
        
        
             Butler also expended himself defending LeBron James throughout the game, which made his offensive exploits even more impressive. He missed four games in January due to knee soreness, but the Wolves obviously aren't trying to limit him -- in the six games since his return, he's averaging an astounding 38.7 minutes. As long as he stays healthy, he's locked in as an early-round value in nearly any format.

             This could be his last game as a Jazzman. An earlier report said as many as 15 teams have called about Hood, and he's turned in two good games in a row with this and a 30-point Monday. He's still a hold in standard leagues and hopefully a bad team lands him to help his usage rate.

             The Wolves fell to 1-7 in their past seven road games, with an atrocious defensive rating of 119.1 in those losses. The good news is that the Cavs' defense is just as bad, so nearly anyone who took the court had an inflated stat line tonight -- Teague padded his with two 3-pointers, three rebounds, one steal and zero turnovers in 39 minutes.

             In the process, Wiggins became the sixth youngest player in NBA history to score at least 6,000 points. His ability to get buckets is indisputable, and at age 22 we've yet to glimpse his ceiling as a scorer. For fantasy purposes, however, he's being dragged down by 43.8% field goals and 63.4% free throws, both on heavily-weighted attempts.

             Dwyane Wade (illness) was out tonight, which helped Osman's case, and there's no reason to think he'll emerge as a fantasy asset. Then again, let's not forget that in late January, coach Tyronn Lue referred to the Cavs' bench as ""the best bench ... in Cavs history.""

             Head coach Tyronn Lue is in the hot seat right now, and Thomas added fuel recently by questioning the coach staff's ability to make in-game adjustments. In response, Lue said, ""That's not true."" Thomas could do the team a favor by knocking down more shots, as this is just the fourth time in 15 appearances this season that he's made at least half of his shot attempts. He also looked openly exasperated when LeBron declined to pass to him late in OT, and this situation could get worse before it gets better.

             He bounced back after a brutal Tuesday and his coach gave him big minutes. Harrison is likely looking at a bigger role with the Grizzlies likely to unload some of their depth. Kobi Simmons (foot) is also hurt, so he likely won't get competition from him. Adding Harrison as a PG flier seems like a good idea in 12-team leagues.

Coach Erik Spoelstra gave him in his props after the game because of how The Beard closed. ""He's a three-way player. Add the ability to draw fouls and you've got a four-dimensional player,"" Spoelstra said. ""He can get you to the rim. He can get you in mid-range. He can get you from the 3. He can facilitate. Then when the game's on the line, he was his best."" He has to be the MVP favorite right now.

             He said he hurt his ankle under the basket and it was just a turn of his left one as he drove to the basket. Murray did walk it off and it looked like he's just getting re-taped, but the Spurs will be safe here. If he's limited going forward, that means more run for Tony Parker. It doesn't sound serious.

             Well, the Suns are running out of point guards with Josh Gray the last one standing. We may even see some Dragan Bender at the point. Gray isn't a terrible add in deep leagues.

             According to the report, the Clippers are seeking a first-round pick to surrender Bradley in a deal. While the Clippers did sign Lou Williams today, they're not tied to Bradley for an extension. Bradley would lose minutes with the Spurs and the same would go for Danny Green.

            LeBron James recorded his ninth triple-double of the season on Wednesday with 37 points, 15 assists, 10 rebounds, five 3-pointers, and one miraculous game-winner with 1.0 seconds left in overtime.
        
        
             LBJ helped force overtime by sinking a difficult 3-pointer with 45.0 seconds remaining, he later blocked Jimmy Butler at the rim with 1.0 second left in OT, and on the ensuing inbounds play he caught the ball at the free-throw line, turned and fired a perfect fadeaway over Butler's outstretched arm. He finished 16-of-22 from the field with one steal and one block in 48 minutes. It was a rousing home win on national TV, and the Cavs really needed it given their recent dysfunction. It's the latest reminder that LeBron is still King James.

             The Wolves and Cavs combined for an NBA-record 40 made 3-pointers tonight, with Cleveland contributing 21 of those makes. Their defense has been atrocious lately and they've needed to pour in points to win, so it's encouraging that Smith is a combined 10-of-17 from deep in his past two games. He's been a liability in most leagues this season, though, and we don't see that changing any time soon.

             The Rockets went with a ton of P.J. Tucker and Luc Mbah a Moute, so Green didn't get a chance to shine against one of his former teams. Maybe Eric Gordon (back) misses more time, but most fantasy owners should be targeting trade-deadline beneficiaries on the wire instead.

             What a stud. Richardson is the only Heat player to see action in every game this year and most advanced stats will tell you that he's more deserving to be an All-Star than Goran Dragic. After he really struggled with his shot, Richardson has a very effective 56.0 eFG% on his 298 jumpers since Dec. 1 and fills the stat sheets -- he's had a shooting line of 49/47/83 in that span. J-Rich has been a top-15 player in standard leagues over that span, so his patient owners are loving how well he's played in his breakout season. Congrats if you drafted him.

             He's basically on a reverse-snub run with three really nice games since he was named to the All-Star Team, including a season-high 33 points on Saturday. The Heat offense is looking a little better and part of that is on Dragic starting to find his shot. He said his arm injury from back in December could linger, so it looks like it's totally behind him now.

He's a hold.

            Blake Griffin led the Pistons with 25 points on Wednesday, making 9-of-19 FGs and 6-of-7 FTs with seven assists, three rebounds, two steals and one 3-pointer.
        
        
             Stan Van Gundy has been staggering Blake and Andre Drummond to ensure he has one of them on the floor at all times, and it's working. The Pistons have won five consecutive games, including four straight with Blake, whose chemistry with Andre Drummond has been incredible to watch. The Pistons play one fewer game than the Clippers down the stretch, but fantasy owners won't complain while Griffin is playing at this level.

             Kennard's recent foot injury is behind him but it'll be hard for him to carve out standard-league value while Reggie Bullock (34 minutes) and Stanley Johnson (39 minutes) are active. He also lacks across-the-board production, so even if his role increases he's just a target for points and threes.

            Jahlil Okafor faded on Wednesday with two points, one rebound, one assist and four personal fouls in nine minutes.
        
        
             A matchup vs. Blake Griffin and a red-hot Andre Drummond isn't exactly made-to-order for Okafor, whose defensive struggles are well known. The Nets have now lost eight of their past nine games and they're starting to turn loose the young guys, but Okafor's upside is severely limited with 19-year-old Jarrett Allen thriving in the starting role.

            D'Angelo Russell had more turnovers (six) than points (four) during Wednesday's road loss, going 2-of-5 from the field with five assists, four rebounds and one steal in 17 minutes.
        
        
             Russell is shooting a solid 62.7% on 67 attempts in the restricted area this season, yet he's taken more attempts from mid-range (41.4% on 70 attempts) and above-the-break 3-pointers (28.4% on 88 attempts). The 3-pointers are nice but most fantasy owners would prefer to see him attacking the basket. He returned from knee surgery just a few weeks ago, so hopefully we'll see a more aggressive Russell over the Nets' final 26 games.

            Nik Stauskas went scoreless again on Wednesday, missing all six of his shot attempts without a single stat to his credit.
        
        
             The Nets were very short-handed and playing in the second half of a back-to-back set, yet Stauskas still couldn't make an impact. He's a combined 0-of-9 from the field over the past two games, which says plenty about his lack of fantasy appeal.

            Jarrett Allen had multiple career-highs on Wednesday with 14 rebounds and six assists, adding 13 points, two blocks and one steal in a loss to the Pistons.
        
        
             Allen actually doubled his previous high for assists, and the Nets as a team had 32 dimes on 39 made baskets. The impressive rookie has also done a good job avoiding silly fouls, with just four fouls in his past 82 minutes of action, which should help him earn more run -- Timofey Mozgov and Jahlil Okafor combined to play just 16 minutes tonight. He's the first Nets rookie center since 1983-84 with 10+ points, 10+ rebounds and 5+ assists in a game, and his fantasy owners are laughing all the way to the bank.

This is great news for Chriss and also the same goes for Bender, so maybe it'll get Chriss going again.

             Carroll has seven double-doubles this season, which is one shy of his combined total in his first eight NBA seasons. He's been raining 3-pointers with enough boards and defensive stats for value in nearly any format, but his rest-of-season outlook is murky on a rebuilding Nets team. And if he's traded, it's hard to see him enjoying the same role he's had in Brooklyn.

             He saw a lot of late run today, which was the opposite trend he had coming into this game. Before tonight, Whiteside shockingly ranked ninth on the team in fourth-quarter minutes in 2018, but coach Erik Spoelstra went with him a bunch even against the floor-spacing Rockets. Obviously Kelly Olynyk (shoulder) not playing was a major factor on this. Either way, this was a good night for Whiteside fans, but we're still only expecting him to play in the upper 20s once Olynyk is back.

             Coach Erik Spoelstra said he was going to play Bam with Hassan Whiteside, but not having Kelly Olynyk likely changed his plan. Whiteside did also play more fourth quarter minutes than usual, so it was a mild down night for Adebayo. That said, he's earning more minutes and he's shown some upside this month, so he's still a hold.

             Caris LeVert (knee, concussion), Rondae Hollis-Jefferson (groin) and Quincy Acy (finger) were all unavailable tonight, so there were plenty of minutes for Harris to soak up in a small-ball lineup. He did commit five turnovers, which stings in 9-cat leagues, and he hasn't scored 10+ points in consecutive games since Jan. 23-26. Harris is a solid late-round value but we're inclined to look for higher upside at the trade deadline.

             Crabbe also went 2-of-2 from the FT line with one block and just two turnovers in 36 minutes. He poured in 20 of his 34 points in the fourth quarter, enjoying an expanded role without Rondae Hollis-Jefferson (groin), Quincy Acy (finger) or Caris LeVert (knee, concussion). It's been a bumpy road for Crabbe this season (38.1% shooting, limited supporting stats) and he should be viewed as a late-round guy despite this scintillating performance.

             He has a sore neck, but Chandler not playing on a back-to-back set is hardly a surprise. Chandler is expected to play in back-to-back sets moving forward, and the Suns are reportedly having a tough time trading him. All bets are off on what they'll do without Chandler and Alex Len has looked bad. Maybe we see Dragan Bender and Marquese Chriss start together, and perhaps Alec Peters is behind him.

             It's a curious move from Memphis, but there's no indication that it's related to his recent knee soreness. Check back after the game to see how he fares.

             Well, we've seen the Grizzlies go with big lineups before, so they'll just start out like that. We'll see what this means for the bench, but Martin really isn't someone to add until the Grizzlies start making deals.

             The Thunder should be able to pull out a win in Los Angeles without Anthony's services, so it wouldn't be all that shocking to see him sit that one out. Jerami Grant and Pattrick Patterson would likely split the majority of his minutes, and while Patterson would likely start, Grant is the more attractive fantasy target between the two. Russell Westbrook (ankle) is also questionable to play, so Paul George could be extremely busy on Thursday.

Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson would also see a spike in usage.

            Eric Gordon (back) and Ryan Anderson (ankle) are both out for Wednesday against the Heat.
        
        
             The Rockets will hold Gordon out until at least Friday after he returned on Tuesday. It doesn't sound like it's serious for Gordon, but it wouldn't be a surprise to see them manage him until the All-Star break. With him out, Gerald Green should take double-digit treys while Markel Brown could be playing more. Expect to see more Luc Mbah a Moute and P.J. Tucker, too.

             He was doubtful to play and the Heat won't have their best shooter. Against a team like Houston, this could become a high-scoring game, but the Heat may also opt to go with bigger lineups to give them more length. Expect Tyler Johnson, Justise Winslow, Josh Richardson and Goran Dragic to get more opportunity than usual.

The Pacers have used a 'Dipo-Lance backcourt for 13 minutes this season, so that combination could still be on the table -- it could close, too. Stephenson has played well enough to be held, and he has an increased chance while Darren Collison (knee) is out.

             Alvin Gentry said he wants Rondo with the second unit to ""provide a spark,"" which isn't traditionally the type of verbiage we hear when discussing No. 9. Rondo has played well in two of the past three games, so it'll be interesting to see how he responds to the bench role. While Liggins is starting, he still might be confined to minutes in the teens, so he's not a great target in most leagues.

With him likely out, it should be Gerald Green, Luc Mbah a Moute and P.J. Tucker stepping up. Dropping Gordon in a shallow league isn't a bad idea.

             He did have a mild ankle tweak on Monday, but he should be all set in a great matchup. Drummond and Blake Griffin have been great together with their starting unit posting an elite +15.9 net rating together. He's an option in DFS.

             A flight cancellation caused him to miss Monday's game, but he should be all set for Friday and his conditioning is good to go. Markkanen's return should take major minutes away from Paul Zipser, but Bobby Portis should still be asked to play a lot. Cristiano Felicio could also be moving out of the rotation.

Hardaway Jr. hopped to the locker room last night, but it was likely just because he didn't want to risk any further damage. With Enes Kanter and Kristaps Porzingis out, THJ and Michael Beasley will be extremely busy.

             Well, the Knicks are going to be in deep trouble up front with no Kanter and Kristaps Porzingis. Assuming Kyle O'Quinn isn't traded, he should be looking at minutes, but it's certainly possible he is gone before 3:00 tomorrow. Either way, we're probably going to get a look at Isaiah Hicks and Luke Kornet tomorrow. Just keep an eye on them in deep leagues.

             That should put him back on track to play for Friday against the Blazers and coach Dave Joerger is hopeful to have him out there. Fox was starting to trend up in a big way with at least 15-plus points in his four previous games before suffering an injury on Monday. With the Kings headed for a high spot in the lottery, expect to see a lot of Fox to finish the season.

He talked about how he's adjusting to this type of injury, how he's taking it day by day, and how he's still hopeful to be in the 3-point contest -- he also said Klay Thompson will finish second. Booker is more day-to-day than anything else, and it'll be Tyler Ulis, Josh Gray and Josh Jackson benefitting the most.

You would have to be in a super deep league to give him a look, of course.

             He's almost certainly not going to make it back before the All-Star break as he recovers from an MCL sprain. Josh Hart has been the star of the show and should be owned in standard leagues as we head into the deadline.

             You have to wonder of how many of those 15 teams called after his 30-point game on Monday. The Jazz were expected to sell, but their NBA-best six-game active win streak may have changed that. Hood should still be owned in standard leagues despite his propensity to wind up on the injury report.

             It's important to note here that this reporter was the first on the Greg Monroe buyout news, so we'll side with him on this for now. Additionally, Scott Bordow on the AZ Republic said the ""only way"" they deal Chriss is for star like say a Kemba Walker. The Suns are expected to try to speed up what has been called as ""The Timeline"" and maybe dumping Chriss can help that. He may be in a good spot tonight with the Suns on a back-to-back set, but obviously is a risky fantasy play in basically every sense.

If he is able to get back out there, Dwight Powell would likely head back to the second unit and Wesley Matthews won't be quite as involved on offense. Stay tuned.

             He's probably going to miss more than Thursday. Gordon has already ruled himself out for the dunk contest, which is very noteworthy because he said he really wanted to win it in his home state. It wouldn't be a surprise to see him be held out until the break. With him out, Mario Hezonja has stepped up the most, but he could be dealt -- anyone could be dealt on this team.

Belinelli and Ilyasova will almost assuredly be jettisoned ahead of the deadline, but it would likely take a fairly large offer to snag Prince. A trade away from Atlanta would not be ideal for Prince's rest-of-season outlook.

             This move would support the narrative that the Clippers were ""retooling"" and not ""rebuilding"" with the Blake Griffin trade, so at this point, it seems somewhat less likely that DeAndre Jordan will be dealt at the deadline. This also will ramp up Boston and Denver's efforts to swing a deal for Tyreke Evans, as both Evans and Williams were on their radar. With Sweet Lou locked up in Los Angeles, he should easily finish the season as a top-30 guy.

You'd think that with Kristaps Porzingis (knee) going down for the year, that the Knicks would have been looking to get Hernangomez into the rotation, but instead they'll flip him for an expiring contract and some late second-rounders.

             ""I played my average minutes, you know,"" Whiteside said after logging just 23 minutes during Monday's loss to the Magic despite not having Kelly Olynyk (shoulder) for most of the game. ""I average, what, 22 minutes, 23 minutes. So thats pretty much how its been."" When Whiteside was asked if he expected to get more minutes with Olynyk leaving the game early he responded: ""Maybe, maybe. I mean, how long I know [Erik Spoelstra]? About four years? So, I dont know.""

             ""Bam is becoming undeniable now. But both [Whiteside and Adebayo] are forces for us and you have to look at in a different lens going forward,"" said Spoelstra. ""They're both playing very good basketball, very impactful basketball. I want to maximize that as much as possible."" Whiteside and Adebayo have played a total of 36 minutes together this season, and Miami has gone 6-1 in games they've shared the floor. Adebayo is someone to consider swooping up in deep leagues, particularly with Whiteside's name being floated in trade rumors.

             Monroe is currently on his way to meet up with the Celtics in D.C., where he'll officially sign his contract with Boston, and he's expected to do so ahead of Thursday's tip. He's probably not going to be earning minutes in the 30s in Boston, but he's capable of providing some low-end value if he can consistently get into the 25-minute range. His arrival in Boston isn't great news for Aron Baynes and Marcus Morris' rest-of-season outlook.

             The Nets have done an excellent job with Dinwiddie's development, but his trade value may never be higher than it is right now, and he's an attractive trade chip with just $1.6 million due to him next season. If another team offers up a first-round pick for Dinwiddie, that could be enough for them to pull the trigger. A move outside of Brooklyn would assuredly be a negative for Dinwiddie's rest-of-season outlook, so hopefully, the Nets stand pat on Spencer.

The Rockets got close in the past, but with how well Clint Capela has been playing this season, there's not much incentive to bring on DJ. Portland has reportedly ""backed away"" from Jordan for now, and the Bucks and Wizards simply might not have the pieces to get a deal done.

Elfrid Payton is also bound for free agency, and most expect him to leave Orlando as a free agent this summer, so he could be another name to watch ahead of the deadline.

Things could always change if another team comes through with some sort of Godfather offer, but most reports to this point have the Grizzlies standing pat. If Gasol does remain in Memphis, there's a decent chance he'll get shut down at some point, so owners should be trying to sell high while he's still out there.

Huestis isn't going to get many touches and isn't a high-usage player, so he's only worth keeping an eye on in very deep formats.

             The rookie played a career-high 36 minutes with Devin Booker (hip, ribs) on the shelf, hitting 7-of-19 shots and 1-of-2 free throws with three turnovers.  He's been one of the most improved players since the new year and has been a tremendous pickup in all formats, averaging 20.0 points, 7.0 rebounds, 1.0 blocks, 1.0 steals and 1.6 triples in his last five games. He looks poised for a strong finish to the season and the Suns have every reason to keep feeding him minutes.

             He missed the last two games for personal reasons and helped fill in for an ejected Draymond Green tonight. Other than that, there's nothing to see here.

             Stephen Curry had 21 points and a full stat line, and Klay Thompson added 12 points and two 3-pointers in the blowout loss. The Thunder came out on fire in this one and Russell Westbrook appeared to be motivated after a hard foul from Patrick McCaw in the first quarter, and then torched the Dubs for 20-plus points in the opening stanza. Most of the Warriors starters sat for most of the fourth quarter and this was the first time they have lost two straight games this season, and they've now lost three of their last four. But they still have the best record in the league at 41-13.

             Now that Greg Monroe is gone, it's going to be interesting to see if Chandler is rested on the second night of a back-to-back set vs. the Spurs Wednesday. Alex Len doesn't look healthy right now, so maybe Chandler plays. He's still a shut-down candidate after the All-Star break, assuming he's not moved at the deadline. Fantasy owners can do better.

            Carmelo Anthony lasted just six minutes before spraining his right ankle on Tuesday and wasn't able to return, finishing with zero points on 0-for-4 shooting.
        
        
             It initially sounded like Melo'd be able to return, but the ankle was more sore than he initially thought it would be and the Thunder shut him down. Consider him day-to-day and look for Jerami Grant to get some extra minutes if he's going to miss time. Grant played 35 minutes and had 16 points, four boards, two assists, three blocks and a 3-pointer tonight, so he's worth a look if Melo is going to miss time.

             He's inconsistent, immature and prone to foul trouble, but he can put up some nice fantasy lines when he's in the mood. Coach Jay Triano called it a matchup-based decision to bring Chriss off the bench tonight, but he was more productive than Dragan Bender was in 38 minutes. If you want to gamble on his upside after the All-Star break and like scary rollercoaster rides, Chriss could be your guy, but he's more of a stash until he strings a few good games together.

             Warren did have a scary moment when he slammed his head into the court after his shot was blocked, and while he stayed on the court for about a minute holding his head, he didn't go back to the locker room and was able to finish the game. Concussion symptoms can appear later on, so it's not a complete lock that he's out of the woods. He gets a 3.3 usage rate bump with Devin Booker (hip, ribs) off the floor and will be a strong play once again on Wednesday vs. the Spurs, but double check to make sure he's not on the injury report.

             Clarkson's name is constantly in trade rumors, but he's been playing pretty well. He just couldn't get his shots to fall tonight and snapped his double-digit scoring streak at eight games. He'll bounce back in the next one, but if he's traded, it's possible he could lose a lot of value. Just hope he lands on another bad team if he's moved.

             Booker is not expected to play Wednesday against the Spurs, so Ulis should be in line for at least one more start. He was 4-of-11 from the field and missed all three 3-pointers, but backup PG Josh Gray was almost just as productive in half the minutes Ulis saw. Even while Booker is out, Ulis hasn't played well enough to be considered in standard leagues.

             It sounds like Ball isn't likely to play again before the All-Star break and Hart was awesome again tonight. He's now double-doubled in three straight games, is shooting it lights out, and has hit eight 3-pointers in those three games as well.

             ""Were not going to rush him back,"" Luke Walton said. ""Lets say hes ready to play  the last game (before the break, Feb. 15 in Minnesota)  At that point wed probably say lets give him an extra week and get him back afterwards."" Ball also reportedly felt some pain in the knee recently and it feels like the Lakers aren't going to put him on the court until he's 100 percent pain free. If Josh Hart is still available in your league, go ahead and add him if you have room.

             Randle's been on fire, averaging 19.2 points, 9.0 rebounds and 3.4 assists on 58 percent shooting over his last five games. Trade rumors are swirling, but whether he goes or not, he's rolling for the Lakers.

             Well, it wasn't the best first impression. John Henson (hamstring) was out tonight, but Zeller was still the third center behind Thon Maker and Marshall Plumlee. There's no fantasy value here, but we'd expect him to eventually pass Plumlee.

             The first one came when he exploded on an official just before halftime, showing her his bloody mouth and complaining about not getting the call in a very physical game. The last one came after he clobbered Alex Abrines and then lightly threw the ball more 'at' than 'to' the official after the foul call. He leads the league in technicals with 13, has been ejected three times, and is now just three more techs away from a one-game suspension.

             As expected, he still didn't see many minutes and he wasn't very effective in eight previous starts this season with 6.0 points, 3.4 boards, 1.0 steals. He's just a stash in dynasty leagues, but may have some short-term value in deeper re-draft leagues if Henson can't return on Friday vs. Miami.

             If you were worried about Giannis' ankle after he left Sunday's game early, click on the link below and relax. He basically jumped right over Tim Hardaway Jr. for one of the best dunks of the season and led the Bucks to their straight win in the process. He finished 10-of-23 from the field and 3-of-6 from the line, adding 11 rebounds, six assists, one steal and two blocks. He'll get a couple days of rest before Friday's game vs. Miami.

             He did have five turnovers, but it's hard to fault him for that as much as he has the ball in his hands. And as players continue to drop like flies with injuries throughout the league, Simmons might just find himself on an All-Star Team soon.

             In a season where so much is going wrong on the injury front, Embiid has been one of the true feel-good stories, playing in a back-to-back set over the weekend and racking up six straight double-doubles. Almost every Sixers starter went off tonight, as Dario Saric had 20 points and seven boards, Ben Simmons had a 15-6-8-3-1 line and J.J. Redick scored 18 with six assists and four 3-pointers. Robert Covington was the odd man out, but still had 12 points, five boards, a steal and two 3-pointers in the win. Now excuse us as we go knock on wood.

             Marcin Gortat was helpless against Joel Embiid and Mahinmi, along with Mike Scott and Kelly Oubre, were all effective off the bench. If Gortat is moved and the Wiz don't bring back a good center, Mahinmi could suddenly become relevant. Just keep an eye on him, as he's played well in three of his last four games.

However, he might still have a few drops left in the tank, as Ryan Anderson (ankle) got hurt tonight and Trevor Ariza is out with a hamstring injury.

            Michael Beasley started the second half of Tuesday's 103-89 loss to the Bucks and finished with nine points, six rebounds, two assists, one block and five turnovers in 24 minutes.
        
        
             He was 3-of-11 from the field and 3-of-4 from the line, and while this wasn't a good game from him, he's one of the top pickups of the night with Kristaps Porzingis suffering a torn ACL. Beasley has a 30.2 usage rate with Porzingis off the floor this season and does have seven starts under his belt, averaging 20.3 points, 5.1 rebounds, 2.1 assists, 1.0 blocks and 0.7 triples in those games. He's prone to foul trouble and high turnovers, but does have good shooting percentages and has mid-round upside the rest of the way.

             Ryan Anderson left the game with a sprained ankle and is iffy for Wednesday, meaning Tucker might get extended minutes again in that one. But we'd rather roll the dice on someone like Eric Gordon or Gerald Green, who both scored in double figures tonight.

             Russell hasn't played more than 24 minutes since returning from his injury and is averaging just 20 minutes over his last five games, along with 11.4 points, 3.2 rebounds, 3.2 assists and is shooting just 35 percent from the floor. Everything has changed in Brooklyn since he got hurt and we'll have to see what the trade deadline brings. There's still a chance for DAR to see a minutes boost and start satisfying his owners, but it's been a pretty rough reality to deal with, given how good he was prior to the knee injury.

             Quincy Acy was out tonight, which opened some extra minutes for Okafor, and he had one of his better games of the season tonight. He hadn't played more than 15 minutes in his previous three games, so we're still not ready to jump up and down with excitement, especially with Jarrett Allen now starting. But, as usual, you should just keep an eye on Okafor in case the minutes start sticking and he starts playing well.

             Quincy Acy was out so DeMarre Carroll shifted to power forward, giving Harris the start at small forward. Harris has been fun to own at times this year and can be an effective streaming option, but he's a borderline hold in 12-team leagues.

             Carroll somehow has a total of just six rebounds in his last four games and really hasn't been doing much besides scoring, hitting some threes and occasionally blocking shots. He's averaging just 14.2 points, 2.6 rebounds, 1.6 assists, 0.8 steals, 0.6 blocks and 2.4 3-pointers over his last five, but at least he's been scoring and hitting threes with some regularity. He's on the trade block and might lose minutes if he stays put, so owner should plan accordingly for the future, as it doesn't look all that bright. He moved to small forward with Quincy Acy out tonight and had his first 20-point game in his last nine, so at least there's that.

             Thomas got off to a nice start offensively, but disappeared with zero points in the second half. His defense has been borderline brutal and he's not making up for it on the offensive end -- he's shooting 30.5% from the field in his last eight games.

""I'm here for the long haul,"" he said. ""I'm here for this season right now, try to figure out ways we can still compete. I couldn't give up on my teammates like that. I couldn't do that."" The Cavs led by as many as 21 points tonight, but they were outscored 65-31 in the second half and were held to nine points in the fourth quarter.

             He's been playing well, scoring in double digits in five straight games, dropping eight dimes in two straight games, while also rebounding, stealing and three-ing for the Raptors. He's worth a look in 12-team leagues right now, although he did get a few extra minutes given the lopsided score of tonight's game.

He did seem fine on Tuesday vs. the Magic with 11 points, four rebounds, one assist, one block and two triples in 23 minutes, but even with Kevin Love (hand) out and the Cavs struggling, it looks like he'll have a limited workload with some DNPs the rest of the way.

             Lowry came in struggling with his shot and hadn't scored more than 15 points in three of his previous four games, so it was nice to see him get back on track tonight. This was Toronto's fifth straight home win over Boston, they snapped Boston's four-game winning streak, and the Raptors closed the gap between them and Boston to just one game in the East. Additionally, this was Toronto's fifth straight home win, where they are 22-4 this season.

             This game was full of garbage time, but Miles didn't really see any extra run. He was just on fire when he was in there tonight, and a more realistic expectation is what he did with 14 minutes of run on Sunday, when he hit 1-of-3 shots for three points and not much else. Ignore Miles for now, despite the incredible 15-minute performance.

             The Raptors blew out the Celtics tonight, so JV wasn't needed much in the second half, while coach Dwane Casey said after the game that JV could have played more if needed. It sounds like nothing more than a tweak and we're guessing he'll be out there on Thursday night against the Knicks, who lost Kristaps Porzingis for the season tonight to a torn left ACL.

            An MRI confirmed that Kristaps Porzingis tore the ACL in his left knee.
        
        
             Absolutely brutal. Porzingis will miss the remainder of the season and is likely going to be looking at a 9-12 month recovery, so he probably won't be ready for opening night in 2018-19. With Porzingis out, Michael Beasley becomes a must-own player, Enes Kanter will get more touches and we'll get a longer look at Kyle O'Quinn or Willy Hernangomez, depending on what the Knicks do at the deadline.

             Greg Monroe still hasn't signed with the Celtics, which is good news for Morris, but once Monroe's on board, it's hard to envision Morris holding much value, if any.

             He came into tonight's game ranking 9th in the NBA in free throw percentage at 89.8%, but hit just 4-of-9 from there Tuesday. He did hit 7-of-13 shots from the field and played 37 minutes after playing less than 30 minutes in his previous four games. Fournier's name has been in the rumor mill this season and Chris Mannix of Yahoo Sports said the Magic are ""open for business,"" so it's possible this was his last game in a Magic uniform.

             The Raptors crushed the Celtics in the first half and Brad Stevens had seen enough from most of his starters. That worked out well for Rozier, who led the Celtics in scoring off the pine. He's going to take a hit with Irving back, but as long as Marcus Smart remains out with his lacerated hand, Rozier should still be pretty fun to own.

             His injury probably didn't even limit his minutes, as starters Al Horford and Jayson Tatum were right there with him in the low 20s. The Raptors blew the game open in the second quarter and it was mostly a garbage-time contest after that. Irving had missed three straight, so owners should just be thankful he's back. Hopefully he'll be ready for the Wizards on Thursday.

             Toronto put this one away in the second quarter, blitzing the Celtics 36-19 and it became a garbage-time fest for Boston. No starter played more than 24 minutes other than Jaylen Brown, who got 27, while Marcus Morris, Daniel Their and Terry Rozier all played big minutes off the bench for the Celtics. Chalk this one up as a bad night for Horford and crew and hope they fare better on Thursday against the Wizards.

             Birch was the third center off the bench during the first half, but leapfrogged Marreese Speights in the second half. He was 4-of-5 from the field and played some really nice defense on LeBron James when he was switched onto him in pick-and-rolls. If there's one player who deserves more minutes in Orlando it's Birch, and he could be interesting if the Magic move a big or two at the deadline.

             He took a Jabari Parker elbow to the face against the Bucks on Tuesday and his lip opened up once again. He missed the final 12 seconds of the second quarter to get cleaned up, but returned for the second half and finished with 19 points, 16 rebounds, one assist and one steal in 32 minutes. He said he's not sure how much time he will miss, but did say he wants to play on Thursday vs. Toronto. The Knicks have Kyle O'Quinn and Willy Hernangomez on the trade block, but one of those guys could have some nice value if Kanter sits, especially with Kristaps Porzingis (knee) getting hurt tonight. Keep in mind that the trade deadline is Thursday afternoon.

            Jonathon Simmons (ankle) went off for a career-high 34 points in Tuesday's 116-98 comeback win over the Cavaliers.
        
        
             What a night for Simmons. After the game he said he was ""very close"" to not playing, but added that he didn't want to let his teammates down. He helped the Magic erase a 21-point deficit in the second quarter and they outscored Cleveland 65-31 in the second half. Simmons had 22 of his 34 points in the third quarter, hitting 12-of-17 shots with seven rebounds, two assists, one steal, one block and two triples. His upside isn't the greatest, but he's fun to own when he's hot and that's what he is right now -- he's scored 14+ in five straight and has two triples in each of his last four.

             The Hawks somewhat surprisingly haven't unleashed Collins since his arm injury in December. However, that could change because guys like Miles Plumlee, Dewayne Dedmon and/or Ersan Ilyasova could be gone by Thursday. Although, the New York Times reported Ilyasova may not want to be traded. Either way, Collins needs to be owned

             He was starting to get out of his slump, but he was cold again at just 1-of-8 from the field. Coach Mike Budenholzer isn't really going to be able to bench Prince as much because he will be shorthanded, so hopefully he avoids two mega duds like he did when he didn't score on Jan. 31 and scored just three on Jan. 29. He should be owned in standard leagues.

             This is good news for the Knicks after Hardaway Jr. missed six weeks for a stress injury to his lower left leg. He looked to be kicked in the shin, and he wasn't putting weight on his foot as he hopped back to the locker room. For now, it sounds like he could only be day-to-day. This was not a fun night at MSG.

            Ersan Ilyasova can veto any trade as a One-Year Bird player and to this point has shown little interest in relocating, according to Marc Stein of the New York Times.
        
        
             This comes as a fairly big surprise with this report adding there is ""considerable"" interest in Ilyasova. Maybe this changes for Ilyasova if a team can make the right pitch. If he stays, that would hurt the upside of guys like Taurean Prince and John Collins. Ilyasova's fantasy value could also hold up better with the Hawks.

             Anderson left Tuesday's game with a right ankle sprain, and while the Rockets initially called him ""probable"" to return, they ruled him out for the game a few minutes into the second half. ""He probably could've played,"" coach Mike D'Antoni said. ""He's icing, shouldn't be a [problem]. Now tomorrow night it might be problem, but it's not long-term at all."" If Anderson can't go, expect to see more of P.J. Tucker and Luc Mbah a Moute, but they aren't appealing fantasy assets.

             There's a decent chance that this could be the last game as a Hawks for Dedmon. His skillset is in demand as a great rim protector and now he's suddenly a stretch five with his 39 percent from deep this season. His value would almost certainly take a hit on another team.

             He did tweak his ankle in the second half, but Schroder stayed in the game after he nodded to his coach that he's OK. The Hawks are ""open for business"" in the trade market, and maybe there's a chance they can get a taker on Schroder. That doesn't sound likely, so expect him to finish up the season in ATL.

             He basically slotted right into Marc Belinelli's role, and that could continue with Bellineli now set to be dealt. DeAndre Bembry (calf) doesn't sound close to a return, which means Dorsey could be getting an extended look in the near future. Plus, Dorsey did take some minutes from Taurean Prince last week. Dorsey did play the nine minutes in garbage time, so expect him to be closer to 20 minutes.

Gasol could see his minutes dip later in the season, but keep rolling him out there while he's active.

He's still a decent hold heading into the deadline.

             Yeah, a team-high 13 points isn't the best time. especially when it's against the team that had the worst record in the league before tonight. Chalmers has played well in the last two games and it'll be interesting to see what the Grizzlies do with him. He has an expiring deal, but Chalmers probably won't be getting anything in a trade. Perhaps the most likely outcome would be a buyout. Leave him on the wire and he's really hard to trust on the Memphis roster.

             He was the first one pulled from the game and it was a little earlier than expected with 8:18 left in the first. Harrison committed a travel to cause the move of Mario Chalmers replacing him. The Grizzlies are going to unload Tyreke Evans and it's possible Mario Chalmers could also be headed out of town, so Harrison has some stash appeal. His previous two games were solid at 17.0 points, 4.0 boards, 5.5 assists, 0.5 steals and 1.5 treys.

            Tim Hardaway Jr. tweaked his left leg on Tuesday vs. the Bucks and went back to the locker room with under seven minutes to go in the fourth quarter.
        
        
             The Knicks are down big, so his night is likely done. He appeared to get kicked in the left leg, the same one that had the stress injury. This is obviously a big concern and THJ wasn't putting much weight on it as he went back to the locker room. With Kristaps Porzingis (knee) also injured tonight, Michael Beasley has to be picked up. We'll have an update soon.

            Caris LeVert (possible concussion) will not return to Tuesday's game vs. Houston.
        
        
             He ran right into a Nene screen and there was quite a bit of blood. The Nets quickly ruled him out for the remainder of the game, but hopefully we get good news regarding his concussion evaluation. With the Nets already very shorthanded, we could see a lot of Joe Harris and maybe Nik Stauskas if LeVert misses additional time. He finished with nine points, three rebounds, three assists, one steal and one triple in 12 minutes.

Beasley is a strong speculative add and has done well as a fill-in starter this season, averaging 20.3 points, 5.1 rebounds, 2.1 assists, 1.0 blocks and 0.7 triples in seven starts.

             Going into halftime, the Rockets called him ""probable"" to return with a right ankle sprain, but P.J. Tucker started the second half and Anderson was ruled out shortly after. He finishing scoreless with one rebound in nine minutes. We'll consider him questionable for Wednesday's game vs. Miami. If he can't go, we'll see more of Tucker and Luc Mbah a Moute, but they are not standard-league pickups.

            Kristaps Porzingis is undergoing an MRI on his left knee on Tuesday night, according to Adrian Wojnarowski of ESPN.com.
        
        
             That is not good at all and the Knicks PR staff has yet to release any information at the time of this update -- they are usually fast with updates. Porzingis' leg got twisted and it's certainly possible he misses extended time with this injury. If you want to think positive, he was able to put some weight on his left leg as he went to get an MRI. Hopefully it's not as bad as it looks, but adding Michael Beasley in fantasy makes sense until we get another update.

             He landed awkwardly after slamming a dunk on Giannis Antetokounmpo and it looked like his whole left leg twisted. He had to be helped to the locker room in obvious pain, but we won't know more until he's re-evaluated by the training staff. For what it's worth, GM Scott Perry and president Steve Mills just went to the locker room to check on him. If KP misses time, Michael Beasley becomes a must-own player.

            Marco Belinelli is being held out of Tuesday's game vs. Memphis due to ongoing trade talks.
        
        
             He's very likely to be moved before the Feb. 8 deadline and has probably played his last game with the Hawks. We learned a while ago that Atlanta was seeking a second-round pick in return, a reasonable price since he has a relatively cheap expiring contract. He'll likely be moved to a contender, meaning his fantasy value will take a hit. Expect heavy workloads from Taurean Prince and Kent Bazmore tonight and maybe more two-PG lineups.

If you were stashing him, you might as well hold on to see what his role looks like in Boston.

While Rozier will take a bit of a hit with the return to the second unit, he should still see quality minutes with Marcus Smart (hand) unavailable.

             Morris sat out the past two games, but it looks like he'll be back out there tonight. That said, Morris' value is trending in the wrong direction with the signing of Greg Monroe, so he's not worth owning in most leagues.

Over the Grizzlies last four games (all starts), Selden is averaging 14.0 points, 3.8 rebounds and 3.0 assists in 31.7 minutes.RotoGrinders.com Daily Slant: He's been all over the map in terms of production since Tyreke Evans has been out of the lineup, but he's in one of his better spots to this point tonight and has a nice shot to bounce back from a few slow games if he's able to continue corralling 30-33 minutes of floor time. He's priced at under $4K on FanDuel which makes him a really appealing tournament play over there, and he sits at $4.4K on DraftKings.

             Head coach Kenny Atkinson wouldn't say who would replace Acy in the starting five tonight, but with Rondae Hollis-Jefferson (groin) also on the sidelines, the Nets will be very thin up front. Joe Harris has started in the past, so Atkinson could move DeMarre Carroll over to the four to start Harris at the three-spot, and Acy's absence should also open up some minutes for Jahlil Okafor. Check back closer to tip-off for an update on the Brooklyn starters.

Jarrett Jack, Ntilikina and Trey Burke have been splitting minutes, making it a somewhat unpredictable committee.

            Marquese Chriss will come off the bench for Tuesday's game against the Lakers.
        
        
             Head coach Jay Triano described the move to keep Dragan Bender in the starting five over Chriss as a matchup-based decision, as he needs more shooting on the floor with Devin Booker (hip) out, and wants his bigs to draw Brook Lopez and Julius Randle away from the paint. Chriss was also seen ""yucking it up"" with Triano at shootaround, so it seems the two sides are on good terms. The bench role isn't great for Chriss' fantasy value, though.

            Devin Booker (hip) is not expected to play Wednesday against the Spurs.
        
        
             Booker did say he was feeling better on Tuesday, but with no practice time ahead of Wednesday's game, it seems unlikely that he'll be able to get out there for the second game of this back-to-back set. With Booker unavailable on Tuesday night, Tyler Ulis will draw the start and there will be more shots for guys like T.J. Warren, Josh Jackson and Dragan Bender.

             To be clear, Ball will not play Tuesday vs. the Suns, and he won't be allowed to return to the court until he gets in a full-contact practice, but he does appear to be making small steps in the right direction. Josh Hart has played well as a starter over the past two games, so he's someone to think about streaming, and Jordan Clarkson will continue to see an uptick in usage with the second unit.

             Marquese Chriss will be back in action tonight after serving his one-game suspension, but he'll come off the bench, and it'll be interesting to see what his minutes look like. Head coach Jay Triano said that move to keep Bender in the starting five was not punishment for Chriss, but rather for matchup purposes against the Lakers with Devin Booker (hip) out. Bender has played well over the past two games, but his minutes could take a hit with Chriss back in the rotation tonight.

             Olynyk left Monday's game in the first quarter vs. the Magic with what the team labeled a left shoulder strain. He was ruled out shortly thereafter and did not return. Fortunately, it sounds like he avoided a serious injury. There is no MRI scheduled. If Olynyk is unable to play on Wednesday, Hassan Whiteside, Bam Adebayo and James Johnson will likely divvy up additional minutes.

According to Woj, Curry's recovery process is expected to take 12-14 weeks, which means he's expected to be fully recovered and on the court by the start of free agency on July 1st. If anybody was still holding onto Curry, he should obviously be sent to the waiver wire in all fantasy formats.

Stephenson would again be an enticing DFS target if Oladipo is unable to play Wednesday. We can expect an update on 'Dipo after Wednesday morning's shootaround.

However, Marcus Smart (hand) and Shane Larkin (knee) are still sidelined, which will allow Rozier to see plenty of playing time as a reserve.

             Dellavedova initially injured the ankle Sunday in Brooklyn and was sent back to Milwaukee to undergo further examination. The Bucks are now dangerously thin at point guard, as Malcolm Brogdon (knee) is also out indefinitely. Starting PG Eric Bledsoe will log as minutes as he can handle, and Giannis Antetokounmpo will likely be asked to facilitate the offense more often than usual. Sean Kilpatrick and Jason Terry will see an uptick in minutes off the bench.

Ferrell had three 3-pointers in each of his two previous games and has been holding onto low-end value for a while, and he could benefit if the Mavs move a veteran or two at the deadline such as Wesley Matthews.

            Boban Marjanovic made his Clippers debut on Monday when he defended an inbound passer for 0.3 seconds near the end of the game.
        
        
             That wasn't much of a debut and he was only in there because he's a giant, but everything could change for him on Thursday if DeAndre Jordan is dealt and the Clippers don't get a prime-time big man in return. Stash him, hope DAJ is gone and then cut him if Jordan ends up staying in L.A.

             Wallace had just eight points, six boards and four assists in 25 minutes on Saturday, but had played very well in his previous two games. A Lou Williams trade could save Wallace, but his hot streak is over and he probably no longer belongs in fantasy lineups for now. Thursday's trade deadline could help him, especially if Williams and DeAndre Jordan are dealt.

             He also fouled out in the final minute and hit just 5-of-17 from the field with zero free throw attempts. His fantasy owners were expecting more with Dallas' top offensive weapon in Harrison Barnes (ankle) sitting out, but DSJ struggled mightily and the Mavs collapsed down the stretch, allowing the Clippers to score the final 13 points of the game. Until he improves his efficiency, he will be a much better fantasy asset in points formats as opposed to category leagues.

             The Clippers scored the final 13 points of the game to overcome a nine-point deficit and Harris has been great in his two games in L.A., averaging 21.5 points, 4.5 rebounds, 2.0 assists, 1.5 steals and 2.0 3-pointers, getting 34.5 minutes per game. Harris should finish up strong as the Clippers fight to make the playoffs with their new-look team.

             Gallo's free throws put the Clippers up one point during a 13-0 run by the Clippers to close out the game, and an Avery Bradley layup off a tremendous jump ball tip by DeAndre Jordan sealed the win for the Clips. LAC is just outside of the Top 8 in the West and they've won four of their last five games (two of their last three since trading Blake Griffin). Gallinari's playing very well and hasn't missed a free throw since his return to action, but it's also probably just a matter of time before he's hurt again. Enjoy him while he's still healthy.

             The rookie's production has been all over the place lately, but he stepped up tonight with De'Aaron Fox leaving the game with an ankle injury. George Hill could be traded by Thursday and Frank Mason (heel) is out until the All-Star break, so Bogdanovic could take over as the primary ball-handler if Fox misses time. He's worth owning, regardless of Fox's status.

             De'Aaron Fox left the game with a sprained left ankle and didn't return, so Hill took over down the stretch. He hit 4-of-9 shots and 4-of-5 free throws, but since the Kings don't play again until after the Feb. 8 deadline, this could've been his last game in a Kings uniform. Considering how much the Kings have rested him, a trade would be good news for his value.

The stats are fine, but the lack of blocks and horrible shooting leave plenty to be desired. He started tonight, but should move back to the bench when Lauri Markkanen (personal) returns on Friday. Either way, Portis is playing well enough to be picked up in most leagues, despite the horrendous shooting. But at least he shot it better tonight after hitting just 8-of-37 shots over his previous three games. He also benefitted tonight by Robin Lopez being ejected after just 13 minutes.

             Walker dropped 38 and 41 points on Wednesday and Friday, but has scored just 18 and 20 in his last two, hitting just six shots in each of them. He'll look to get hot again against Damian Lillard and the Blazers on Thursday night, but he hit just 7-of-26 shots for 14 points in one of his worst games of the season against Lillard back on Dec. 16.

             Batum has now scored in double digits in five straight games and is averaging 20 points, 6.4 rebounds, 4.8 assists, 0.6 steals and 3.8 3-pointers on 50 percent shooting over that stretch. He got off to a really slow start this season, but is still returning 10th-round fantasy value, and has been worth a fifth-round pick over the last couple weeks.

             Murray was playing through a deep thigh bruise and when he wasn't on the court he was in the tunnel riding a stationary bike to stay warm. Despite being less than 100 percent, he still managed to rack up seven assists, four rebounds, two steals and four triples. He'll get a few days to heal up before Friday's game vs. the Nuggets.

             The good news is that the Kings are off until Friday, so he'll have three-plus days to recover. With Fox out, George Hill will take over the point guard duties, and Fox finished with just five points and two assists in 17 minutes.

             He hit all five of his triples in the first quarter, finishing 9-of-13 from the field and 4-of-5 from the line. Coach Mike Malone has called him Denver's MVP this season and it's easy to see why. He's been their most consistent player and this was his 17th game of the season with 20+ points. He'll get a few days off before Friday's game vs. the Rockets.

             This was Gobert's highest-scoring game since Jan. 19, the night he returned from his knee injury. He had scored 11 or fewer points in his previous three games, so it was nice to see him bounce back with a nearly perfect shooting night. Hopefully this means he's going to stay hot, and the Jazz want him to after winning their last six games. They get the Grizzlies on Wednesday and are still three games behind New Orleans for the final playoff spot in the West, despite the winning streak.

             He misses Boogie Cousins, but had scored a total of 81 points over his previous two games, so he just had an off night tonight. The Pels have a date with the Pacers on Wednesday and Davis will look to put Myles Turner in a blender. The 15 points were his fewest since an eight-point night on Jan. 17, and his fourth lowest-scoring game of the season.

             Mysteriously, Moore played just 12 minutes on Saturday, but things were back to normal tonight.

             He was pretty bad on Saturday and was a little questionable tonight due to a leg injury. He's on the trading block and the Jazz have Donovan Mitchell and Royce O'Neale, so they don't really need to keep Hood around. He was on fire tonight and helped the Jazz blowout the Pelicans from the bench, missing his season high by a single point. He's been injured a few times this season and with trade rumors flying, this looks like a great time to sell high on Hood before he gets dealt.

            D.J. Augustin scored 16 points vs. the Heat on Monday with three assists, one rebound, one steal and three triples in 23 minutes.
        
        
             Elfrid Payton played 25 minutes and Shelvin Mack played 27 as the Magic continue to roll with more two-PG lineups while they are shorthanded. The Magic play again on Tuesday and Thursday, so Augustin does have some appeal in deeper leagues as a streaming option. He's scored in double digits in four straight games with nine total triples in that span.

             O'Neale had 18 points, five boards, five assists, three steals and four 3-pointers on Saturday and is averaging 10 points, 4.2 rebounds, 2.6 assists, 1.2 steals and a 3-pointer over his last five games. He's made himself a part of the rotation in Utah and is worth keeping a close eye on going forward. But his big night on Saturday happened without Donovan Mitchell in uniform and Mitchell played just 19 minutes and struggled tonight. So don't get your hopes up that O'Neale will be able to keep it going once Mitchell is back to full strength from an illness.

             Once considered a draft bust, Hezonja has clearly found his confidence this season and is enjoying a career year. He averaged 14.5 points, 5.1 boards, 2.1 triples, 1.8 dimes, 1.0 steal and 0.7 blocks per game on 50.0% shooting in 10 previous starts, so hopefully you were able to snatch him off the wire with Aaron Gordon (hip) already ruled out through Tuesday's game vs. the Cavaliers. He's a strong short-term pickup, but could have some nice rest-of-season value if Orlando moves some veterans at the deadline.

            Donovan Mitchell played through his illness on Monday but lasted just 19 minutes and hit 1-of-6 shots for two points, three assists and a steal.
        
        
             He was out on Saturday when Ricky Rubio exploded for 34 points and was able to go tonight, but the Jazz didn't really need him with such an easy 133-109 win. He'll be in the dunk contest on All-Star Weekend and will look to get his fantasy game back on track against the Grizzlies on Wednesday. It should be interesting to see how Mitchell and Rubio gel once Mitchell gets hot again, but Rubio's been playing well for three weeks now.

             We've been saying for months that Rubio had the serious potential to turn his season around at any moment, just like he did last year, and he's been a beast for about three weeks now. Over his last five, which includes an 11-of-14 shooting night and a career-high 34 points on Saturday, Rubio clocks in with five-game averages of 21 points, 4.6 rebounds, 9.2 assists, a steal and 2.0 3-pointers on 55 percent shooting with just 2.4 turnovers per game. No, he's not really talking about changing his name, but maybe he should. Next year, let someone else draft Rubio, then trade for him in early January, just before he explodes.

            James Johnson played 18 quiet minutes on Monday vs. Orlando, scoring six points with three rebounds, one assist, one steal and one turnover.
        
        
             He was 2-of-5 from the field and brought very little to the table tonight. His fantasy owners probably got their hopes up after he had 18 points, five rebounds, seven assists, three 3-pointers and two steals in 29 minutes in his last outing, but he posted a dud tonight when Miami needed him the most. Kelly Olynyk (shoulder) left the game after just seven minutes and could miss time, so maybe Johnson takes advantage of this opportunity. On Monday, it was Bam Adebayo and Justise Winslow who stepped up for the Heat.

             The Heat are calling his injury a left shoulder strain for now, but he'll be re-evaluated on Tuesday. Olynyk said he hopes it's not serious, but he's in a lot of pain and he was told not to move his shoulder. It sounds like he's going to miss some time, so Bam Adebayo, Justise Winslow, James Johnson and even Jordan Mickey could be in line for more minutes. Adebayo was awesome on Monday, posting an 18-10 double-double with two blocks.

             The Jazz have won five straight games, as Ingles and Ricky Rubio have caught fire, while Rudy Gobert is rounding back into form in a perfect storm for the Jazz. Jingles is back, averaging 15 points, 2.4 rebounds, 2.4 assists, 1.0 steals and 3.8 3-pointers on 60 percent shooting over his last five.

Richardson was also 4-of-5 from the line with two rebounds, two assists and two turnovers in 37 minutes, but his streak of five straight games with at least one block came to an end.

             He played the entire fourth quarter over Hassan Whiteside and had a couple huge blocks in the final minutes. Adebayo hit 6-of-13 shots and 6-of-8 free throws, and could be looking at a bump in value if Kelly Olynyk's shoulder forces him to miss time. If the Heat decide to use the Adebayo-Whiteside frontcourt combo like we saw earlier this season, that would also increase his fantasy appeal. He's an intriguing speculative add and keep in mind that Whiteside could be on the trade block.

             Efficiency usually isn't what Winslow is known for, as he was hitting 40.5% from the field and 65.9% from the line prior to Monday. James Johnson has been eerily quiet for a while and Kelly Olynyk could miss time with a shoulder injury, so we might be seeing more of Winslow going forward. He added eight rebounds, two assists, one steal and one block in 27 minutes, but he'll have a bad taste in his mouth from throwing a sloppy inbounds pass on Miami's final possession. He's a better add in points formats than in category leagues.

             Stephenson started for Victor Oladipo (illness) and played a ton of minutes, but between the poor shooting and turnovers he might have done more damage than good if you had him in your lineup. He's been on a hot streak though and got some extra run with Dipo out tonight, so he deserves some streaming attention as we approach the All-Star break.

             Whiteside was 8-of-16 from the field and 3-of-5 from the line, but like we've seen many times this season, he didn't close the game or touch the floor in the fourth quarter. Bam Adebayo went off with a double-double, but coach Erik Spoelstra has used those two together in the past and may have to do that again if Kelly Olynyk (shoulder) misses time. The good news for Whiteside's owners is that he only needs minutes in the 20s to put up a monster line.

             Joseph has been a better back up player than a starter through his career, but he is going to have plenty of opportunities over the next three weeks with Collison out. There are still much better free agents to target, but Joseph does deserve to be watched closely over the next few games, in case he gets hot.

             Yuck. Turner failed to even score on Saturday, but had played well in his previous three games since returning from his elbow injury, but his last two have been absolutely unforgettable. And given that Victor Oladipo was out for the Pacers tonight, this just looks like a big missed opportunity for Turner. Maybe he'll bounce back against the Pelicans on Wednesday, assuming his knee allows him to play.

If you need threes and want to pick him up, he might be worth it, even playing behind Griffin and Andre Drummond. Additionally, Drummond sprained an ankle tonight, so Tolliver should have a big game on Wednesday if Drummond is unable to go.

            Andre Drummond sprained his right ankle in the fourth quarter of Monday's blowout win over the Blazers, stayed in the game to shoot free throws, and left the game shortly thereafter.
        
        
             He left under his own power, stayed on the bench and didn't even take off his shoe, so it's possible he might have re-entered the game had it not been a blowout. We're going to put him on the injury report, but if we had to guess, it looks like he might be fine to play on Wednesday against the Nets, assuming it doesn't swell badly overnight. Drummond and Blake Griffin look fantastic together and the big man hit 7-of-12 shots for 17 points, 17 rebounds, five assists, a steal and three blocks in 34 minutes, and owners should check back on his status on Tuesday and Wednesday. If Drummond does miss that game Anthony Tolliver would likely be in line for another big night.

            C.J. McCollum scored five points in the first quarter of Monday's loss to the Pistons and then wasn't heard from again until the fourth quarter, when he got hot and salvaged his fantasy line, sort of.
        
        
             CJM finished with 14 points, two rebounds, one assist, one steal, one block and two 3-pointers on 6-of-15 shooting in 30 minutes, while Damian Lillard and Al-Farouq Aminu both played well for the Blazers. There wasn't much to learn from the Blazers box score in this blowout, but the team will look to bounce back on Thursday against the Hornets.

             We still don't know the severity and the Heat are still calling it a left shoulder strain. For what it's worth, this isn't the same shoulder he had surgery on back in 2016. Jordan Mickey started the second half and could see a handful of minutes going forward if Olynyk misses additional time, while Bam Adebayo and James Johnson will also be more involved.

             This deal makes sense for both teams, as Brooklyn had a logjam up front and will roll with Jarrett Allen and Jahlil Okafor at center the rest of the way. As for Zeller, he'll give the Bucks some depth behind John Henson and he will compete for minutes with Thon Maker. This trade only has fantasy implications in very deep leagues and neither Zeller or Vaughn is an appealing pickup.

             Probable to play generally means ""will play"" in Sacramento, but they aren't always the best at updating players status prior to tip-off. It's probably safe to assume that WCS will be out there, so season-long owners can go ahead and get him active.

             This is his second game in a row with a probable tag, but he didn't look great in his last outing with just five points across 16 minutes off the bench. Hood does have restrictions, but coach Quin Snyder wouldn't say what they were. With Hood rumored to be on the trade block, the Jazz might be watching his minutes closely to avoid a setback.

             Aaron Gordon (hip) will be spending his fourth straight game on the sidelines tonight, so Hezonja should be able to flirt with around 30 minutes as a starter. In 10 starts this season, Hezonja owns averages of 14.5 points, 5.1 boards, 2.1 triples, 1.8 dimes, 1.0 steal and 0.7 blocks per game on 50.0% shooting, so he's someone to consider streaming tonight.

             In Joseph's previous start this season he played 31 minutes but finished with just two points, three boards, five dimes and one turnover, so he's not worth much more than a punt play in DFS. Stephenson should have the rock in his hands a ton tonight with both Oladipo and Collison unavailable, and he offers a bit more upside than Joseph, so he's someone to consider streaming.

            Darren Collison is set to undergo arthroscopic surgery on his left knee and is expected to miss the next 2-3 weeks of action.
        
        
             Arthroscopic knee surgery is one of the more minor procedures a player can undergo, so his absence shouldn't extend beyond that 2-3 week window. Cory Joseph should be starting over the next few weeks with Collison unavailable, so he could be worth a speculative add in deep leagues, although he's more of a wait-and-see guy in 12-team leagues with 13 roster spots. Joseph Young should also have the opportunity for some more minutes while Collison is out.

             With Darren Collison (knee) also unavailable, Cory Joseph and Lance Stephenson will move into the starting five and they could be logging major minutes tonight with little depth behind them, making them reasonable DFS targets. Bojan Bogdanovic also figures to have a lot of shots coming his way on Monday, so he too, is on the radar in daily leagues. An illness shouldn't keep Oladipo out long, so for now, we'll consider him questionable for Wednesday's game in New Orleans.

Josh Jackson and T.J. Warren would pick up most of Booker's usage, and both those guys would be in play in DFS. Stay tuned.

Morris should be considered questionable, but his rest-of-season outlook isn't great with Greg Monroe in town.

             Parsons said he's feeling good, and that there's a chance he'll be able to get back to the court prior to the All-Star break. That said, he's been irrelevant in fantasy hoops for two years now, and there's no reason to expect that to change.

             This isn't the first time Anderson's name has popped up in the rumor mill ahead of the trade deadline, but he's owed roughly $41.7 million over the next two season, so it could be tough to find a taker given he's only averaging 10.2 points, 5.4 boards and 2.1 triples per game this year.

             Barnes did not go through shootaround and it's unclear if he'll be available to play on Thursday in Golden State, so this is more than just a minor ankle issue. With him out tonight, there will be more minutes for guys like Maxi Kleber, Dwight Powell and Josh McRoberts and more shots for Dennis Smith Jr., J.J. Barea, Devin Harris and Dirk Nowitzki.

Terrance Ferguson is a candidate to move to the bench and has scored a combined two points in his last five games. Alex Abrines could move into the starting lineup in his place, but he's only worth a speculative add in very deep leagues for his 3-point shooting.

             The Nuggets have also been linked to Darren Collison recently, so it's clear they are looking for backcourt help at the deadline. Boston's asking price for Smart is a first-round pick, so it will be interesting to see if Denver pulls the trigger on a move like this. Smart would likely be used as a combo guard behind Jamal Murray and Gary Harris in Denver, similar to the role he already has. This would be bad news for Will Barton, though.

             Getting ruled out this early for his fourth and fifth straight game is worrying and Gordon is pulling himself out of the dunk contest as well. With the Magic going nowhere this season, AG could miss Thursday's game vs. the Hawks as well, but his status is TBD for that one. Several players will benefit with AG out including Marreese Speights and Mario Hezonja, but Hezonja is the better streaming option.

Smith is a solid streaming option while Reggie Jackson (ankle) is out, while Galloway is only worth a look in deeper formats. Galloway did score 13 points with four assists in 21 minutes in his last outing, though.

            Willy Hernangomez has requested to be traded from the Knicks before the Feb. 8 deadline according to Shams Charania of Yahoo Sports.
        
        
             Now that this report is circulating, the Knicks will lose some leverage in trade talks. Despite a strong finish to his rookie season, Hernangomez has been an afterthought for the Knicks and has been buried on the depth chart behind Enes Kanter and Kyle O'Quinn. Several unknown teams have engaged in trade talks with the Knicks, but it's impossible to predict what his fantasy value would be until we know which teams are involved. Still, if you're stashing him then you can consider this good news.

             The Knicks will list him as questionable for Tuesday's game vs. the Bucks, but he previously said he was hopeful to play. The rookie admitted that his knee has been bothering him for about a month, so that might explain his quiet play. If Ntilikina doesn't play, Trey Burke will take over as Jarrett Jack's backup and had 14 points in 20 minutes on Sunday.

As for Pat Connaughton, he had two points in 19 minutes.

""Hes never going to force it and he looks really good of late. Hes a big reason why our offense has been clicking the way it has of late.

He plays in a way that his teammates trust him. Hes playing (power forward and small forward) and hes tough as nails."" Marvin Williams (ankle) missed his third straight game and Frank Kaminsky was pretty bad, but Graham stepped up with 15 points on 6-of-10 shooting with two 3-pointers, four rebounds, two steals and one assist. While he's not a standard-league pickup, deep-league owners can just keep an eye on him.

             ""Its been like a month,"" Ntilikina said. ""It [felt] a little sore. Now it feels a little more sore. It will be all right."" Ntilikina was technically ""available"" to return to the second half of Sunday's game vs. the Hawks, but the Knicks sat him for the remainder of the game after seven first half minutes. The rookie said he's hoping to play on Tuesday vs. the Bucks, though it would make sense for the Knicks to give him a day off. If he can't go, Trey Burke will take over as the backup and is coming off a nice game with  14 points in 20 minutes.

             Wright had been connecting on just 13.3% of his shot attempts in the three games prior to Sunday's win, so it was nice to see him come through with a more efficient outing, and his play on the defensive end helped him stay on the floor for the entirety of the fourth quarter. That said, he hasn't played very well at all over the past month, so we'll need to see him do this again before recommending him as an add in most formats.

             Abrines had been playing fairly well over the previous two games, but tonight's less-than-stellar outing could be described as a regression to the mean. He did severely outplay starter Terrance Ferguson, and it's worth noting that the lineups that featured Abrines on Sunday had a significantly better defensive rating, so he might be able to work his way into the starting five. Still, even as a starter, he wouldn't be much more than a low-end 3-point specialist in deep leagues.

             Patterson finished Sunday's game with just three points, one assist and one triple over 12 minutes, but Donovan might be getting antsy after OKC's fourth consecutive loss. That said, Patterson would probably only be able to earn minutes in the 20s in an ideal scenario, which still isn't really enough time for him to make a difference in most leagues.

             Jackson has now scored at least 20 points in four consecutive games -- the only other rookies to accomplish that in Suns history are Devin Booker, Walter Davis and Alvan Adams. The Suns are already turning him loose and that will only accelerate in the final 28 games. Despite tonight's hot shooting, he's still a more appealing option in points leagues that don't penalize FG percentages (39.5% this season) -- it was just last Sunday that he went 0-of-13 from the field vs. Houston.

             The Lakers did a really nice job of keeping Adams off the offensive glass and being forced out to the perimeter to guard Brook Lopez limited his rebounding opportunities on the other end of the floor. Still, he was able to match his season-high in steals, and as per usual, he got his points efficiently, going 5-of-8 from the field and 2-of-2 from the charity stripe. Adams has been a steady top-50 guy all year long, and there's no reason to expect his production to dip.

            Nicolas Batum had 22 points, five assists, four rebounds, three 3-pointers and one steal during Sunday's 115-110 road win in Phoenix.
        
        
             The Hornets are making a concerted effort to get Batum involved in the first quarter, and it's paying dividends. ""By the very nature of how [Batum] plays, hes good to play through early,"" said coach Steve Clifford. ""Hes going to make the right play ... When he has the ball, everybody touches it."" Charlotte has won three straight games, aided by Batum's improved play, and he's surging as a top-50 value over the past few weeks. The wait may have been worth it for patient fantasy owners.

             Len has a long history of ankle injuries, so it's possible the Suns will limit his minutes even if he's completely healthy. There's decent rest-of-season potential here, but don't hold him at the expense of another hot free agent -- even teammates like Marquese Chriss, Dragan Bender and Josh Jackson look more appealing at the moment.

             Bender did his damage in 27 minutes but the Suns collapsed in the fourth quarter to lose at home, 115-110. Chriss wasn't with the team on Sunday for disciplinary reasons, but it sounds like a situation that will only last one game. Phoenix has lost 10 of their past 12 games and they're going nowhere fast this season, so Bender should get his opportunities even when Chriss is back in the team's good graces.

             The defensive stats are an aberration for Lamb, and this was actually his most combined steals and blocks since Apr. 14, 2016 -- the final game of the 2015-16 regular season. He added one 3-pointer with one turnover in 23 minutes on Sunday, so the only downside was his FG percentage. He's worth a look in deep leagues but it's hard to envision his role expanding while Charlotte is in the playoff hunt -- they're now 3.0 games behind Philly for the No. 8 seed.

             Kemba has made 930 triples in his career, which moves him past Dell Curry for the franchise lead. It's one testament to his stellar play in seven seasons with Charlotte, and a reminder why owner Michael Jordan said he wouldn't trade him without getting guaranteed All-Star talent in return. The trade whispers have quieted recently, too, so maybe he stays put through the deadline.

             PG-13 also added three triples, seven rebounds, three assists, two steals and four turnovers, and he was just one of four players for OKC to connect on at least 50% of his shot attempts.

             He shot 1-of-7 from the field with four misses from downtown, and the Hornets were saved by a strong bench effort tonight. Kaminsky should continue to start while Marvin Williams (ankle) is out of commission, which gives him temporary appeal, but there are many free agents with better rest-of-season potential.

             Anthony ranks in the top-10 in isolation plays, and he runs iso more than both Russell Westbrook and Paul George, which is an interesting thing to consider given that he's connecting on a career-low 41.4% of his shot attempts this season. Billy Donovan said after the game that he'd consider sliding Melo over to the three more often, but changing his position isn't really going to get him away from constantly jacking up tightly contested jumpers. Old habits die hard, we suppose.

The offense hasn't been too much of an issue, but the effort they've displayed on the defensive end has been fairly awful, as the current starting group of Westbrook-Terrance Ferguson-Paul George-Carmelo Anthony-Steven Adams owns a horrendous 121.5 defensive rating.

Those past two outings have come against more traditional frontcourts, so it'll be interesting to see if BroLo can continue working with expanded minutes on Tuesday vs. the Suns.

             The Lakers' second unit hasn't done a very good job of getting Kuzma involved on offense, and overall, he's really struggled ever since Lonzo Ball (knee) hit the sidelines. Over the past 10 games sans Ball, Kuzma has only been offering up averages of 11.6 points, 3.3 rebounds, 1.7 assists, 1.6 triples and 1.3 turnovers per game on 42.1% shooting.

            Devin Booker (left hip pointer) won't return to Sunday's game, finishing with 18 points on 7-of-14 shooting, four 3-pointers, nine assists and five rebounds in 31 minutes.
        
        
             Booker took a hard spill contesting a shot from Cody Zeller and we're considering him day-to-day until more details are provided. He was already playing through bruised right ribs so it couldn't have helped that Zeller also kneed him directly in the midsection on the play. If Booker can't go vs. the Lakers on Tuesday, the Suns will rely even more on Tyler Ulis and Troy Daniels, while possibly adding guys like Davon Reed or Josh Gray to the rotation.

             Ingram has been asked to be more of a facilitator in the offense with Lonzo Ball (knee) out and Josh Hart running the point, and over the past two games with Hart at the one, Ingram has racked up a total of 15 assists. It would be nice if Ingram was more consistent with the defensive stats, and there's no denying the fact that he's a poor free throw shooter, but he's kept his value afloat with the points, boards and dimes.

             The Lakers got embarrassed in a blowout loss to Orlando last Wednesday, which prompted Luke Walton to replace Tyler Ennis in the starting five with Hart, and the end result has been back-to-back wins for L.A. Over that two-game span, Hart has posted averages of 14.5 points, 12.5 rebounds, 2.0 assists, 2.5 triples, 1.5 steals and just 1.0 turnover per game while connecting on an unsustainable 71.4% of his shot attempts. Lonzo Ball (knee) isn't expected to play Tuesday, so Hart figures to earn another start, putting him on the radar in deep leagues.

We should have a better sense of his availability after Miami's shootaround, so owners should check back in the afternoon -- if he's out, expect Kelly Olynyk and Bam Adebayo to once again split his minutes.

The good news is that KP still came through for fantasy owners in a big way.

             There was a bizarre sequence late in the game when Kent Bazemore (19 points) was accidentally awarded two free throws, rather than three. The refs recognized the mistake after New York had scored, which erased the Knicks' two points while giving the Hawks an extra point. Weird. Muscala played ahead of John Collins down the stretch, but he benefited from the absence of Ersan Ilyasova (illness) and isn't worth owning outside of very deep leagues.

Ilyasova is day-to-day and the last-place Hawks have no real incentive to play the veteran Dedmon down the stretch, especially since he'll likely decline a $6.3 million player option this summer. In most situations, it makes sense to cut him for a promising rest-of-season free agent.

            Marc Gasol scored 20 points on 6-of-16 shooting during Sunday's blowout loss to Toronto, adding six rebounds, five assists, two 3-pointers, one steal, two blocks and four turnovers in 37 minutes.
        
        
             Gasol has been attempting a career-high 4.3 triples per contest this season, which can partly explain why hes shooting a career-low 41.7% from the field this season, although a lot of that has to do with the lack of help around him. With another loss the Grizzlies dropped to 18-34 on the season, so if Gasol remains in Memphis this year, he could certainly be shut down at some point. Owners should be trying to sell-high while he's still out there, as a trade does not seem likely at this point.

The best news is that the injury doesn't involve his troublesome knee, but he's still questionable to play vs. the Knicks on Tuesday. ""We have a great medical staff,"" he said. ""Hopefully I can be there [in New York]."" We should know more Monday afternoon.

            Nerlens Noel (left thumb surgery) has progressed to 5-on-0 and non-contact drills, and he could be cleared to play after the All-Star break.
        
        
             Interestingly, coach Rick Carlisle said he's ""dying to get [Noel] back ... definitely looking forward to having him available."" Noel fell out of the rotation when healthy but he could get renewed playing time after the break, because the Mavs reportedly want to see how he and Dennis Smith Jr. look together. If you're stashing him, though, it's likely in the hopes of a trade.

            Wayne Selden couldn't buy a bucket during Sunday's loss to the Raptors, going 3-of-12 from the field and 2-of-3 from the stripe on his way to eight points in 35 minutes.
        
        
             Selden is going to have a ton of opportunity coming his way on this terrible Memphis team, but as you can see, increased shots and minutes don't always equate to fantasy value for Selden. He also produced seven rebounds, one assist, one steal and four turnovers while he was out there, but Selden probably won't be much more than a late-round guy with the Grizzlies.

He's been extremely durable throughout his career and hasn't missed a game this season, so we're optimistic, but owners should check for updates after the Mavs' shootaround.

             Harrison typically doesn't bring many stats to the defensive side of the box score, but he's essentially locked into big minutes for Memphis with Mike Conley (Achilles) done for the year and Tyreke Evans no longer a part of the equation, so he has some low-end appeal in deep leagues. Over the past four games, Harrison has put forth averages of 14.5 points, 5.8 dimes and 1.0 triple per contest on 47.7% shooting.

             VanVleet has endeared himself to head coach Dwane Casey with the immense amount of hustle he puts on display each and every night, and he's been rolling over the past few weeks with averages of 14.3 points, 3.5 dimes, 2.2 triples, 1.0 steal and just 0.5 turnovers per game on 52.5% shooting. It's unlikely he'll be able to keep up this stellar play for the remainder of the season, but he's worth owning in most leagues while he's this hot.

There are just too many bigs in the rotation in for the Raptors, so itll be tough for Ibaka to crack the 30-minute mark on most nights.

             DeRozan struggled to get his shot to drop in this one, going 5-of-14 from the field, and with the game well in hand during crunch time and the reserves playing with more tenacity than the starters; DeRozan watched the entire fourth quarter from the bench. We'd expect a bit of a bounce-back performance on Tuesday against the Celtics.

             None of the Raptors' starters played during the fourth quarter on Sunday, and while part of that had to do with the lopsided score, Lowry's minutes were also affected by his lackadaisical effort on defense. Lowry's been struggling with his jumper over the past few weeks, connecting on just 37.1% of his shot attempts, and overall, his numbers have been down across the board this season. He should snap out of the shooting funk at some point, but he might not be much more than top-35 this season.

             The Nets are still searching for win No. 20 this season, which would match their total from 2016-17, and the youth movement should be in full bloom before long. LeVert added just one assist today but it was great to see him attacking the basket -- only one of his shots came beyond four feet. His role is a bit murky with D'Angelo Russell healthy, but the Nets should find him enough minutes to be worth a look in deeper leagues.

            D'Angelo Russell handed out seven assists in 18 minutes on Sunday, adding three points on 1-of-8 shooting, one rebound and one 3-pointer.
        
        
             Russell also turned it over twice and his minutes were limited by fouls -- he eventually fouled out. He's still scraping off the rust after missing more than two months, but has been trending up as the All-Star break approaches. It also looked like coach Kenny Atkinson was trying to get the ball in his hands more often, because Russell only played 1.6 minutes alongside Spencer Dinwiddie (nine points, 10 assists in 29 minutes.

             Nurkic had the hot hand early for Portland and he continues to trend in a positive direction. Over the past month, hes established himself as a mid-round guy with averages of 13.8 points, 9.1 boards, 1.2 assists, 1.3 blocks and 2.1 turnovers per contest on 52.4% shooting from the field and 76.7% from the stripe. If he could get his blocks per game average closer to 2.0, and up his steals numbers, he could easily work his way into the top-40 equation.

             Harkless was able to earn some extended minutes in the rotation as the matchup against Boston suited him, and he racked up four of his five triples through the first half of action. As good as he was, hes been woefully inconsistent this season, so well need to see a repeat effort before recommending him as an add in most formats.

             McCollum was solid through the first half of action, but he really struggled to get his shot to drop after halftime, going 4-of-14 from the field over the final two quarters. It's not all that surprising that McCollum struggled as the Celtics are the best team in the league at defending the two-spot in terms of defensive efficiency, but he very rarely struggles in consecutive games, so we'd expect a bounce-back performance on Monday in Detroit.

             Lillard struggled to get his shot to drop in this one, but he still found a way to be effective by getting to the line and setting up his teammates for open looks. The Celtics are one of the best teams in the league at defending the point guard position, so its not exactly shocking that Lillard struggled today, but wed expect a much more efficient outing on Monday with a much more favorable matchup against the Pistons.

             Maybe he was hyped to prove something vs. the Nets' up-and-coming center Jarrett Allen, but whatever the reason Henson was all over the place today. He's playing solid minutes, hasn't turned the ball over in the past four games, and even shot a reasonable 72.2% at the line in January. Unless Milwaukee trades for another center, his rest-of-season value should hold steady in the 75-100 range.

             Today marked the 10th time that the Celtics were able to pull out a win after trailing by at least 12 points, and Horford was a huge part of the winning effort with his strong second half play, helping the Celtics overcome a 16-point deficit after halftime. This was also Horford's second career, game-winning buzzer-beater, and his first time doing so in a Celtics jersey.

He and Jason Terry (two minutes) will be leaned on even more if Matthew Dellavedova (ankle) is forced to miss games after getting hurt late on Sunday. Brown is still just a deep-league desperation play, though.

Roziers value will take a hit with the move back to the bench, but hell still have the opportunity for extended minutes while Marcus Smart (hand) is out.

            Giannis Antetokounmpo turned his right ankle in the fourth quarter on Sunday, but Bucks owner Marc Lasry said after the game that ""Giannis is fine.""
        
        
             He had the ankle re-taped on the Bucks bench and didn't go into the locker room, finishing with 16 points, eight rebounds, four assists and one block in 28 minutes. It doesn't appear to be serious but we'll include him on the injury report as a precaution, since  the Bucks won't take unnecessary risks with their superstar. Consider him questionable to face the Knicks on Tuesday.

             Ball tried to test the injury in Toronto earlier in the week and ""felt something,"" so the Lakers will continue to be cautious. Until he's able to go through full speed non-contact drills without a problem, Ball will continue to sit out practices. Josh Hart will draw his second straight start at PG on Sunday and is coming off a double-double in his previous outing.

We should see more of Evan Turner (calf) and maybe Pat Connaughton.

The Hawks will roll with Dewayne Dedmon in his place who is averaging 8.6 points, 6.8 rebounds and 1.8 assists on 68% shooting in his last five games. With Ilyasova on the trade block, he's not a player worth holding onto in most formats.

            The Celtics haven't officially signed Greg Monroe yet, meaning he likely won't play on Sunday vs. Portland.
        
        
             Unless he puts pen to paper in the next hour, Monroe will sit this one out. The Celtics do have a four-game week on deck, but it's anybody's guess as to what his role will be in Boston.

""He had a pretty good workout this morning."" With Shane Larkin (knee) and Marcus Smart (hand) both out as well, Terry Rozier will draw his third straight start. In his last two fill-in starts, Rozier averaged 24.0 points, 9.0 rebounds, 6.0 assists, 2.0 steals and 4.5 triples.

             This will be his second straight game on the shelf, but he remains day-to-day.

Williams still has some swelling and stiffness, but he did some shooting, footwork drills and ""light jumping"" on Saturday. It doesn't sound like he will play vs. Denver on Monday either, but maybe he can make it back for Thursday vs. the Blazers.

             ""I dont want just plays to score. When you get me involved early in a game, I can do this ball-movement stuff,"" he said. ""Like [Fridays win vs. the Pacers]: I scored, 31 points, but we were moving. There wasnt a lot of one-on-one play. I dont know how many assists we had in the first quarter, but it had to be a lot."" His fantasy owners are loving life right now, as he also had a triple-double vs. the Hawks on Jan. 31 and a 22-point effort vs. the Pacers on Jan. 29. If the Hornets have a quiet trade deadline, that will be good news for Batum.

            J.J. Barea (oblique) finished with five points, 11 assists and a rebound over 24 minutes in his return Saturday at Sacramento.
        
        
             Barea struggled from the field, hitting just 2-of-12, including 1-of-9 from behind the 3-point line. Despite the off shooting night he still managed to post a team-high plus-17 rating. The team is on tap for four games in the upcoming week. It appears safe to get him back into the active fantasy lineup in deeper leagues.

            Wesley Matthews finished with 11 points on 5-of-7 shooting from the field in Saturday's 106-99 win at Sacramento.
        
        
             The point totals for Matthews have been a bit erratic lately, and he was held without a rebound for the first time since Dec. 22 in Miami. Matthews is reportedly on the trading block, so he is a slightly risky fantasy play this week with the deadline on Thursday. The Mavericks have four games in the upcoming scoring period, but that could obviously be interrupted with a transaction.

             Barnes was good for 7-of-14 from the field, including 4-of-8 from behind the 3-point line, and he chipped in with two rebounds, an assist and a steal over 34 minutes. He is averaging 19.2 points over the past five outings, slightly over his season average, but his rebounds have been doing lately and he is working on a four-game streak without a blocked shot. Despite the lack of defensive stats recently he remains useful in most fantasy formats.

             Powell hit 7-of-9 from the field and 3-of-3 from the free-throw stripe. It was his best scoring output since he dropped 21 against Golden State on Jan. 3. He continues to trend in the right direction, averaging 7.7 points, 8.7 rebounds and 1.7 steals per game over the past three outings. He is worth scooping up if you need frontcourt help in competitive fantasy leagues.

             Nowitzki entered the game 32 minutes short of 50,000 minutes for his career, so he needs just six minutes on the road Monday against the Clippers to become the sixth player in NBA history to hit the milestone. ""And you wonder why I move like I've had hip-replacement surgery,"" he joked to teammate Dwight Powell. ""It's just another staggering accomplishment,"" head coach Rick Carlisle added.

             Ginobili hit 5-of-9 from the floor, including 1-of-3 from behind the 3-point line, as it was turn-back-the-clock night. He and Tony Parker were two of just five Spurs with double-digit point totals. He appears to be good to go after a thigh injury slowed him last week, but he remains nothing more than a deeper league fantasy option at this juncture.

It was a rare mediocre night for Murray, who has been playing pretty well since head coach Gregg Popovich made the change. Expect Parker to keep coming off the bench, making him a less-than-attractive fantasy option more often than not.

             Bertans was a surprise starter in place of Pau Gasol, but he didn't do much with the opportunity. He added just one rebounds and one assist over 19 minutes, while Gasol scored eight points with 11 rebounds over 20 minutes. It's uncertain if Gregg Popovich is considering this permanently, or if Gasol was originally going to get a rest and then was called upon as a change of heart by Pop. Either way, Gasol is the better fantasy option at this juncture.

             What a wild week. Barton missed the last shot in back-to-back losses on Monday and Tuesday, but this time he was the hero today. The Nuggets were down 12 earlier in the game, but a massive 38-point fourth gave them a win in front of their biggest crowd in franchise history at Pepsi Center. Barton is seeing a ridiculous amount of minutes with 38.6 per game over his last five, so that is really helping him become a must-start fantasy asset.

            Rodney Hood (leg) finished with just five points across 16 minutes off the bench Saturday at San Antonio.
        
        
             Hood was on the mend for two weeks due to a leg contusion, and the team treated him with kid gloves in this one even with Donovan Mitchell out due to illness. It was Ricky Rubio, Alec Burks, Royce O'Neale and Raul Neto picking up the scoring slack in this one. Eventually Hood is going to knock off the rust, and the team will kick off the training wheels, and it will be costly to Alec Burks and his playing time.

             Neto was seeing a little extra run with Donovan Mitchell sidelined, so he took advantage. He was just 3-of-7 from the field, and 0-of-3 from behind the arc, but he drove to the lane several times and made several trips to the free-throw line, finishing 6-of-6 at the stripe. With Mitchell likely back Monday in New Orleans from his illness, Neto will be back to a limited role to squash any temporary fantasy appeal.

             He's really hit his stride lately and the new-look offense has been big time. Coach Mike Malone said he's going to call fewer plays to open things up for guys like Big Honey. Maybe it's that or maybe it's because he switched to women's deodorant, but Jokic has averages of 19.2 points, 11.2 boards, 8.6 dimes and 1.6 treys over his last five since he said it's switching to a different deodorant. He's been every bit of the player his fantasy owners were hoping for with top-20 value and an upward trend.

             O'Neale was a very efficient 6-of-7 from the field, including a perfect 4-of-4 from behind the 3-point line, while chipping in with five rebounds, five assists and three steals across his 32 minutes off the bench. He stepped up nicely, as he and Ricky Rubio made a nice one-two punch subbing for the ill Donovan Mitchell. Despite the big game, O'Neale's fantasy appeal is still limited to the very deepest of leagues heading into the new week.

             He took a knee to his right thigh in the first quarter and had to go to the locker room. Murray had treatment on his thigh at multiple points in this game and he was on the stationary bike. He'll be feeling this one tomorrow and we will probably see him on the injury report for Monday, but he should be out there. Murray has been a tough customer after he played through a hernia last season for 82 games. He's been a fantasy stud.

             He had just seven points on Thursday, but at least added six boards, three steals and a block on a 3-of-10 shooting night in that one. He's been doing a much better job of contributing something other than points on most nights, but Saturday gave us a glimpse of the old Wiggins. Having said that, he's still only ranked as a 13th-round player by Basketballmonster.com on the season. However, over the past month he's been a 10th-round player, meaning he should still be owned everywhere.

             It was a great offensive game from KD, but the Warriors defense completely fell apart in the fourth. They gave up 38 points in the fourth quarter and it's fair to chalk this up to a schedule loss on a back-to-back in altitude. Despite the possible concern about the Warriors, KD scored 30 points in consecutive games for the first time since December. This loss could be good news for his value because the Rockets are now just 2.0 games back and the Rockets do have the tiebreaker. KD gets a revenge game against OKC on Tuesday, so his stat line should be sweeter than a cupcake.

             Everyone was 'taking note' of Rubio's performance, as he took it upon himself to pick up the slack with Donovan Mitchell in street clothes battling an illness. Rubio was an impressive 11-of-14 from the field, including 3-of-4 from behind the arc, while stepping up with 9-of-10 from the free-throw line. He also added nine assists and three rebounds while turning over it four times. He'll take a step back offensively on Monday in New Orleans, especially if Mitchell is well, but it should be a decent fantasy week with four games on the docket.

            Alec Burks moved into the starting lineup Saturday at San Antonio and he finished with eight points, eight rebounds and two assists across 25 minutes.
        
        
             It wasn't a horrific night in terms of fantasy production, as he started to the ill Donovan Mitchell. However, Burks took the circuitous route to the eight points, hitting 3-of-10 from the field, 1-of-2 from behind the arc and he was 1-of-2 from the free-throw stripe. Expect this to be a one-off, as Donny Mitchell should be well enough to play Monday in New Orleans, the first contest in a four-game week.

             He's now scored at least 20 points in eight straight games and his slow start to the season is a distant memory. Karl-Anthony Towns added 22 points, 16 rebounds and three 3-pointers, and the Wolves currently sit as the No. 4 seed in the West, with a close eye on third, chasing the Spurs. They're healthy and rolling, and their studs have all become must-starts in fantasy until further notice.

             Green amassed all three of his swats through the first quarter of action, and he made the most of his extended minutes with both Eric Gordon (back) and Trevor Ariza (hamstring) unavailable. However, Gordon is expected to get back to the court on Tuesday in Brooklyn, so Green will likely see his minutes reduced to the lower-20s. He's someone to consider streaming when the Rockets are less than 100%, but he's not worth owning in most leagues when their backcourt is fully intact.

             His debut couldn't have gone much better and he should be starting at power forward soon for the Pelicans. He's a must-own player and while he won't be this good on most nights, he should finish up strong and end up being one of the true steals of fantasy drafts this year.

             Holiday has struggled in his last two games and has hit just 8-of-28 shots over his last two. He was on fire prior to that, and this has to be looked at as nothing more than a mini-slump, although the steal, two blocks and dimes were great. He'll bounce back offensively against Ricky Rubio and the Jazz on Monday, so don't back off of him.

             The big news is he qualifies as the most expensive center in Fanduel after opening most of the season at power forward, and is still possibly the best player in fantasy. The Pelicans are still clinging to the No. 7 seed in the West without DeMarcus Cousins, so Davis will still be counted on for big things going forward. He could get hurt at any time, but then again, so could any other player in the league. Roll with him and don't look back.

             Harden faced little resistance on drives to the hoop, and he embarrassed the Cleveland bigs on numerous occasions when they got caught on switches. He did tweak his right ankle midway through the third quarter, but he played through it and didn't seem any worse for the wear, so we wouldn't expect Harden to miss Tuesday's game in Brooklyn.

             CP3 nailed his first three buckets, all triples, and as an added bonus for 9-cat owners he didn't commit a single turnover while he was out there; so, par for the course for one of the best point guards in the league. He got whatever he wanted all night long, essentially taking turns with James Harden dissecting Isaiah Thomas on the offensive end, and the groin was a complete non-issue.

            Tristan Tompson didn't play great during Saturday's loss to the Rockets, scoring nine points on 4-of-6 shooting to go with five rebounds and one steal over 25 minutes.
        
        
             Thompson hasnt really seen a dramatic increase in minutes since Love hit the sidelines, earning 24.2 minutes a night over the past two to go with averages of 4.5 points, 5.5 boards and 1.0 block per game on 36.4% shooting from the field and 50.0% from the stripe. He's not worth owning in most leagues.

             It looks like Kevin Loves minutes will be divvied up between Crowder, Channing Frye and Jeff Green, and that three-way timeshare isnt really great news for anyone. Frye finished with three points, seven boards, one steal and one turnover in 18 minutes off the bench, and Green ended his evening with six points, four boards, two dimes and one turnover in 21 minutes.

             James got off to a slow start and didnt get much help from his teammates either, which resulted in Cleveland heading into halftime with a 26-point disadvantage. Things never really got better after that, and the end result was a 32-point loss for Cleveland. LBJ is probably steaming, so we'd expect him to take out some of that aggression against the Magic in Orlando on Tuesday.

             Smiths three triples were a team-high, which highlights how mightily Cleveland struggled from long-range in this one.  As a team, they went 0-of-7 from distance through the first quarter of action, which amounted to their most attempts without a make through any first quarter this season; and overall they finished just 8-of-30 from beyond the arc. Smith has been too up-and-down this season to trust in most 12-team leagues.

He'll probably cool off at some point, but Stephenson continues to close and make an impact on the stat sheet. He's worth a long look in standard leagues while he's hot.

             Thomas struggled from start to finish, as he was never really able to find his rhythm, which has been a consistent issue for him this season. The Cavs need him to step up his game with Kevin Love (hand) out of commission for the next eight weeks, but thats easier said than done, and perhaps a slightly unrealistic expectation considering he just got back from a 7.5-month layoff. He should get things going eventually, so owners just need to remain patient.

             Yikes. Joel Embiid put him in early foul trouble in the first half and Turner could never find a rhythm. Embiid can make a lot of bigs look bad, so this rough stat line is more about that than his sore knee -- he was questionable again today. Maybe this can create a small buy-low window.

             Besides the loss, it was a good showing for Embiid on the back-to-back set after he played 34 minutes. The 76ers will have another back-to-back set coming up on Feb. 9-10, so hopefully The Process can go for that one, too. Embiid is in elite company for usage rate at 33.6 this year, which puts him third among scoring qualifiers (Westbrook, Harden).

             The good news for Simmons is he didn't turn the ball over for his second straight game, which comes after he turned it over in every game during January with an average of 3.4 per game. The bad news is the 76ers have lost four of their last five games and have the Pistons just 0.5 games behind them. Simmons may also be losing his grip on Rookie of the Year with Dononvan Mitchell going bonkers these days.

             That makes him the first player to drop a 20-20 with at least four blocks and four steals since 1989. Drummond bounced back in a big way after he did not close on Thursday, and he cleaned up on the offensive glass with seven on that end. The drop in assists is going to be there for Drummond, but his owners can forgive him with monster stat lines like this one.

             He had two big games since the Blake Griffin deal, but this is probably a better representation of what he'll do going forward.

Tolliver played some small forward today because the Pistons were so thin on the perimeter, and maybe that'll continue if Luke Kennard (foot) is out for more time.

             He was in a miniature slump in the middle of January, but Richardson has really found his jumper again. Plus, he's really improved on getting to the basket and finishing there all season. Over his last five, he's doing a little bit of everything with averages of 15.8 points, 2.4 boards, 4.0 assists, 1.8 blocks, 1.4 steals and 2.4 treys on 51.7 percent from the field. Even after his ADP went way up in the middle of October, Richardson has been a complete breakout player in fantasy leagues.

             The bad news is that he was only 4-of-10 from the field and had five turnovers, and while garbage time was a factor in this game, Hezonja has now played 25 minutes or more in four straight contests.

             Biyombo has been steadily trending down since mid-January, and things are going to get worse before they get better with Nikola Vucevic (hand) and Jonathan Isaac (ankle) working their way back into form. Those holding onto Biyombo can drop him for a can't-miss free agent, but if you do decide to hold on, just remember that his fantasy stock is a ticking time bomb.

            Markieff Morris stayed hot in Saturday's win over Orlando, finishing with 16 points, three boards, three assists, and three steals on 7-of-10 shooting.
        
        
             Morris might not be feeling his best physically, but you wouldn't know it from how he's played over the last five games. During that stretch, the former 13th overall selection has averaged 18.4 points, 6.0 rebounds, 2.4 assists, 1.4 steals, 1.6 3-pointers, and 1.6 turnovers on a blistering 34-of-58 (58.6%) from the field, including 16-of-17 from the charity stripe. Morris, who is eligible at three positionsincluding center on Yahoo looks like a sneaky productive play while Kelly Oubre (six points, 2-of-10 shooting) continues to struggle and John Wall (knee surgery) is out.

             Most of the starters played really well and Wayne Ellington was out there to close out, so it cost Johnson. He should still be able to get close to 30 minutes most nights and is still a hold in 12-team leagues, assuming there isn't a red-hot free agent out there.

             That's a classic Porter line, and he only turned the ball over twice in the process.

             He took a knee to the thigh and the Nuggets had to take a timeout to get him out of the game. Murray did go to the bench four about three minutes and was sitting on the floor with a wrap on his right leg. He went to the locker room after that and hopefully this is a minor issue. Emmanuel Mudiay will be playing more.

Go ahead and pick him up and we'll see what happens with him at the deadline.

            Tobias Harris looked outstanding in his Clippers debut during a 113-103 win over the Bulls on Saturday, scoring 24 points with four rebounds, two assists and three 3-pointers in 34 minutes.
        
        
             Every time he gets traded, Harris has almost no transition period and once again he looked like he's played for Doc Rivers for years. Harris was able to create his own shot more today and he'll still be asked to take open 3-pointers -- he scored the Clippers' first three points on his first shot. He also saw a lot of post touches in this game and clearly Rivers wants him to score the ball. Harris should be a strong bet to be a top-50 player going forward or maybe even top 30.

             It's been a long time since Bradley played next to a pass-first guard like Milos Teodosic and they did have some nice plays in transition today. Bradley also played off Tobias Harris more and the Clippers didn't run all those hand-off plays that the Pistons ran for him. It's hardly time to say he's back and this stat line wasn't great, but this was an encouraging game with more opportunity.

             A move to the bench isn't a bad thing for Johnson and he should still find minutes close to 30. Johnson may not be totally healthy from his ankle sprain last month, but he is still worth owning in standard leagues.

             It was just his second game with 20-plus points and it's been a rough ride for Gallo this year. The good news is he should be shooting more and he did play more power forward with Blake Griffin out of town. If he can stay healthy and active on the Clippers, maybe Gallo can hit mid-round value.

             It's a mild surprise he doesn't start against Blake Griffin and maybe the back-to-back is a factor. Johnson hasn't looked right these days and he needs the All-Star break. He's still a hold in standard leagues.

             Coach Erik Spoelstra apparently wants as much size as he can get against Blake Griffin and Andre Drummond. Olynyk is probably going to have guard Griffin, so hopefully he can avoid foul trouble. Olynyk is a lukewarm add because Spo mixes and matches so much with Bam Adebayo playing well.

             Hassan Whiteside (illness) isn't out there and Bam has been outplaying him anyway. He's been awesome as a passer and he's shown a nice touch, so Adebayo could have himself a nice game today. He's worth adding in most standard leagues.

             There's a lot of space in this offense for Teodosic to create and having Avery Bradley's ball-pressure defense should help create more transitions opportunities. Teodosic was also open for five attempts from deep and he should be asked to shoot more with Blake Griffin gone. He'll be a fine low-end point guard.

             Usually when Blake Griffin sits, Jordan does see a slight uptick in scoring and a more noticeable output in boards. However, Tobias Harris is going to get his, so Jordan may not see a change. Plus, there's a very good chance he'll be dealt, but he shouldn't see a major change to his role on any team.

He's not a bad player to hold leading up to the deadline, or just keep him on your watch list when a deal goes down. Austin Rivers returning may not hurt him too much either.

            Montrezl Harrell scored 14 points with seven rebounds, one assist and two blocks in 19 minutes against the Bulls on Saturday.
        
        
             Somewhat surprisingly, he didn't play power forward today with the Clippers going smaller and Tobias Harris going off. Harrell should see more minutes after the deadline, so he's a very strong stash if you're OK with the poor foul shooting. He has plenty of standalone value, too.

             He hit 30 minutes a lot faster than expected and he now has two straight games with 20-plus points. LaVine has yet to play in a back-to-back set, but maybe he does get a chance for playing on Feb. 9 and Feb. 10. It's been so far, so good for those who stashed him all season.

             Unlike the other wings, Holiday has not been squeezed out from the Zach LaVine minutes increase. However, Holiday is cold over his last five, averaging 9.2 points, 2.8 boards, 2.0 assists, 1.0 steals and 2.2 treys on just 28.1 percent from the field. He's still a hold in standard leagues.

             He hasn't really done much with his opportunity and Kris Dunn is finally starting to feel better. Grant will have a couple more games of value, but his owners can make a proactive drop with the trade deadline coming to create a lot of free agents.

             This was one of his better games on offense, but not so much on defense. Zipser may see decent minutes on this roster, but he's not exactly a great per-minute guy. Lauri Markkanen should be back for the next one.

             He's starting to feel the heat from Zach LaVine getting more minutes. Valentine has also stepped up because of no Kris Dunn and has played some point guard, but Dunn is finally starting to feel better. With so many players to add in fantasy, it makes a lot of sense to drop him.

             The usage and minutes are going to be there now that Nikola Mirotic is in New Orleans. Portis can have some serious slumps at times, but he has to be owned for his upside. Plus, the Bulls will make even more trades and he could approach 30 minutes soon.

             The Wizards will be a little thin up front, which means both Markieff Morris and Kelly Oubre should fill minutes. This is also good news for Marcin Gortat because Morris is likely to play almost all PF.

             Well, the Pistons are going to be really thin at guard with most of their bench depth out. This means Langston Galloway has to pick up some big minutes off the bench while Reggie Bullock and Stanley Johnson should be close to 40 minutes. Kennard is a drop candidate.

             They're calling it a cooling off period, so for it's basically a suspension with pay. According to an ESPN report, the incident in question came after the Friday game when Chriss argued with an assistant coach. With him out, it'll be a lot of Dragan Bender with more Jared Dudley. If Alex Len is out, get ready for some wild lineup combos.

             He could be looking at a little more run with Shabazz Napier (toe) questionable. Turner needs serious volume to have fantasy value and he won't get it while Dame Lillard and C.J. McCollum are active.

             It's a new injury for Napier and he may have suffered it over his 21 minutes on Friday. If he can't play, that could open up a few minutes for Pat Connaughton and Evan Turner.

             He suffered the injury on Friday night and is going to get re-evaluated today. Ingram continues to play big minutes and he's suffered some smaller injuries as a result. If he's out, that should open up run for Kyle Kuzma, Josh Hart and Corey Brewer.

            The Suns plan to suspend Marquese Chriss for one game stemming from a verbal confrontation with an assistant coach, according to ESPN's Chris Haynes.
        
        
             Well, this could explain why Chriss played just 14 minutes on Friday. Chriss hasn't exactly had the best attitude with the coaches, and coach Jay Triano has called him out before. With Chriss out, that means the Suns would probably start Dragan Bender and put Jared Dudley behind him. As for their backup center if Alex Len can't play, we may get some Alec Peters action.

The timing is interesting with Johnson reportedly wanting a way out of Utah, but maybe that changed with their four-game winning streak. Royce O'Neale has been effective and should see more minutes while Rodney Hood coming back is a factor.

             Hood has missed each of Utah's last six games and there was some thought that the Jazz might keep him out until the trade deadline, as he is rumored to be on the block. However, it's also possible Utah hopes that by returning to game action and showing that he is healthy, Hood can boost his value league-wide. Royce O'Neale and Alec Burks will see their playing time reduced with Hood back in the mix.

             Wiliams has missed each of the Hornets previous two games, and the fact that they continue to list him out a day ahead of each contest if not particularly encouraging. Frank Kaminsky started in place of Williams on Friday and tallied 15 points, six rebounds and five assists in 30 minutes. Treveon Graham has also seen an uptick in playing time.

             Whiteside logged only 18 minutes Friday night vs. the Sixers and had to leave in the fourth quarter because he was nauseous. Unsurprisingly, he's not yet over the stomach virus. Both Bam Adebayo and Kelly Olynyk will see an uptick in playing time with Whiteside sidelined and are worth considering as streaming options or DFS plays. Adebayo may be inserted into the starting lineup and has intriguing upside, but Olynyk was a more reliable fantasy contributor during Whiteside's extended absence back in December.

D'Antoni will speak to the media about 90 minutes prior to tip-off on Saturday evening.

             It was reported Saturday morning that New Orleans was finalizing a 10-day contract with Okafor. The Pels need depth up front with DeMarcus Cousins sidelined. However, it is unlikely that Okafor, who hasn't played in an NBA game in four years, will be able to earn enough playing time to make a fantasy impact. He can be left on waivers for now.

             The Pels are in need of depth at center after losing DeMarcus Cousins (Achilles) for the season. They attempted to bring in Greg Monroe this week, but Monroe decided to sign with the Celtics for more money. Okafor has played well in the G-League this season, but has not played in an NBA game since 2013. He can be left on waivers in standard-sized leagues for now, as it is unlikely he'll secure consistent minutes with the Pels.

            Jeremy Lin (knee) confirmed that he will be ready to participate in training camp for the 2018-19 season.
        
        
             ""You talking about training camp? Shoot. If I am not, theres issues,"" said Lin. There was a report last month that Lin could be cleared to run and jump by April, so he should be as close to 100 percent as possible by October. Lin is expected to opt into the final year of his contract, worth $12 million.

             Whiteside left Friday's loss to the Sixers in the fourth quarter due to a stomach virus and was unable to return. ""I threw up,"" Whiteside said. ""My stomach is bothering me. I threw up earlier and I felt like I had to go throw up."" If Whiteside is unable to play Saturday night, Bam Adebayo and Kelly Olynyk will soak up additional minutes.

             Jackson was pretty sharp, hitting 7-of-13 from the field and 2-of-4 from behind the 3-point line. He bounced back from a five-point outing on Tuesday in New Orleans. He has been up and down lately, but the Kings are likely to put up with his erratic play, as they lean upon their younger players down the stretch and rest their veterans.

             Hield was busy in his time off the pine, hitting 7-of-14 from the field with 2-of-4 from behind the 3-point line. He also chipped in with three assists, three rebounds and a blocked shot. He has been all over the board lately, going for 24 points in Miami on Jan. 25, then following it up with a scoreless effort in San Antonio on Jan. 28. The Kings will let him work it out, as they play their younger players and rest veterans.

The four triples were his most since his career-high 25 points back on Jan. 17. Hopefully this 12-point game is a sign he is trending back in the right direction after a rough patch. Hold him unless you can find a more productive free agent.

He didn't play with any minutes restrictions, and it appears safe to plug him back into the active fantasy lineup if you haven't done so already. With WCS back in action it was Kosta Koufos suffering, playing just five minutes.

He is averaging 22.0 points, 9.5 rebounds, 2.0 assists and 1.5 steals over the past two outings. Z-Bo might see some additional DNPs down the stretch, as the team leans upon its younger players. However, when he is in there he is still proving he can be a very effective fantasy option.

Swaggy P was seeing a little extra run with Andre Iguodala on the mend, and he certainly outperformed Patrick McCaw.

             Thompson was 8-of-12 from the field, including 4-of-8 from behind the arc. This is more like it. After a rough patch near the end of January he has back-to-back games with 20 or more points for the first time since a four-game run  from Dec. 29-Jan. 4.

             Curry also contributed six assists, five rebounds and two steals. Perhaps the only thing fantasy owners can carp about would be his six turnovers. It was another decent night at the office for Steph, however, and he was 4-of-4 from the free-throw stripe, too. He has made a 3-pointer in each of his 37 games this season, and he has hit a triple in 58 straight dating back to his 0-of-11 night on Feb. 27 last season in Philadelphia.

             Pachulia hit 4-of-6 from the field, and he has four buckets in four of the past five outings. The 13 rebounds represented a season high. He is averaging 7.3 points and 7.0 rebounds per game over the past seven outings to make him worthy of fantasy consideration in deeper formats.

            Kevin Durant finished Friday's game at Sacramento with a game-high 33 points across 37 minutes.
        
        
             Durant hit 12-of-17 from the field, including an impressive 6-of-7 from behind the 3-point line. He also chipped in with six assists and four rebounds. Perhaps the most noteworthy part of Durant's fantasy stat line was that it was his first time this season going back-to-back games without a blocked shot. He'll look to get back on track in the blocks department on Saturday in Denver.

             Green hit 4-of-9 from the field and he turned the ball over five times. Still, it was a pretty decent stat line across the board, as he did a little bit of everything. He is averaging 13.5 points, 7.0 assists and 6.5 rebounds across two meetings with the Kings this season. He'll get two more cracks against the Kings on March 16 at home, and March 31 on the road.

Adams hit 8-of-13 shots and 7-of-10 free throws as he registered his 19th double-double of the season. He's flirting with top-50 value in standard 9-category leagues and is having his best season by a mile.

             Anderson wound up with 11 points while adding a rebound, an assist and a steal. Oddly enough, while perfect from the floor, he was a dismal 1-of-4 from the free-throw line. He was seeing an increase in playing time with the team up 26 points heading into the fourth quarter. His fantasy appeal isn't nearly the same in tight games.

             Terrance Ferguson played just 11 minutes, but his illness may have been a factor. Abrines had 13 points, two rebounds, one assist and two 3-pointers in 29 minutes on Thursday and may be ready to leapfrog Ferguson in the rotation. He's not a standard-league pickup, but keep an eye on him if you need 3-point shooting.

             Simmons hit 8-of-13 from the field and he was a perfect 4-of-4 from the line. At one point Josh Richardson was guarding him, but it didn't see to make a difference who was trying to contain him. The rookie was doing his thing, helping out across the board in the team's six-point win. He'll be back at it Saturday in Indiana. He had a triple-double in the last meeting with the Pacers on Nov. 3, posting 14 points, 11 rebounds, 11 assists, three blocked shots and two steals.

             Moore is going to benefit from more touches with DeMarcus Cousins (Achilles) out for the season and it's a relief to see him put up a nice line after his 8-point dud in his last game. He was 10-of-14 from the field and solid shooting lines are nothing new, as he hit a blistering 59.8% of his shots in December. He has cooled off since the new year, but he's still worth holding onto.

             He hit 17-of-34 shots and 6-of-8 free throws, becoming the all-time leading scorer in Pelicans history. ""Thats huge, big-time for me. Its a team effort,"" Davis said. ""Those guys put me in position to score. Everybody from guys who were here in my rookie year, to guys here now. Everyone allowed me to get that accomplishment."" He's pretty much unfair in fantasy basketball now that DeMarcus Cousins (Achilles) is done for the season, but as always, it's just a matter of whether or not he can stay healthy.

             He played with a lot of energy on both ends and looks like a really nice fit in that offense, but he still played just 16 minutes compared to 35 for Dante Cunningham. With Nikola Mirotic joining the Pelicans on Saturday, Diallo is just someone to keep in mind if Anthony Davis picks up an injury. We have no idea why Diallo isn't getting more burn.

             He's been a ghost lately and desperately needed a big game. Rondo will appreciate having another shooter around in Nikola Mirotic when he joins the team on Saturday, and the two should have some chemistry already from their time together in the Windy City. ""Hes going to be a great addition to our team,"" Rondo said. ""He was a great teammate of mine last year. Great guy in the locker room. Hes going to play to win.""

            Wayne Ellington went for 16 points across 31 minutes off the bench in Friday's 103-97 loss at Philadelphia.
        
        
             Ellington hit 6-of-16 from the field, including 4-of-12 from behind the 3-point line, but that's about all he did. The 30-year-old remains a 3-point specialist for fantasy owners in deeper leagues, as he is among the leaders in the NBA in the category. Other than that he doesn't contribute positively for fantasy purposes.

             Olynyk was sharp, taking advantage of an increase in playing time with Hassan Whiteside leaving the game early due to illness. He could be a sneaky play in Saturday's game at Detroit if Whiteside remains under the weather and is unable to play. Olynyk could be a solid low-cost big man in DFS play if Whiteside sits.

             Goodness. That makes him the first rookie with two 40-point games in a season since Blake Griffin in 2010-11, and he's also the first rookie since Blake to score 30-plus points in at least six games in his first 50 outings. Mitchell also set a Jazz rookie record with those seven treys, and Mitchell has trended up big time there with 2.5 per game in January. In his last 30 games, Mitchell has a 60.1 TS% and a 28.9 usage rate over 34.9 minutes per game. Not only is he among the best rookie scorers in recent memory, the 21-year-old guard is among the best high-volume scorers in the NBA. It's possible Mitchell is looking at early-round fantasy value for the next decade.

            Khris Middleton was quiet vs. the Knicks on Friday with nine points on 3-of-11 shots.
        
        
             He did salvage his line with six rebounds, five assists and a block, and he also connected on all three of his free throws. This was just his second game with single-digit points since the new year, so we'll just chalk it up as an off night. If you're worried about Jabari Parker hurting Middleton's value you really shouldn't be, as Middleton will take on some ball-handling responsibility with Malcolm Brogdon (quad) out 6-8 weeks to offset a slight dip in shot attempts.

             Parker looked bouncy as ever and scored all 12 of his points in the first half. He did looked exhausted towards the end of his shift, but that's to be expected. ""It felt great, but honestly Im training myself to think about it as just getting better,"" Parker said. ""Its not going to take just one game, a few games, its a whole process."" He certainly didn't look like a player coming off two ACL tears and his minutes should gradually increase going forward. It will take some time before he becomes a must-start player, but he has to be owned right now.

             He looked a step slow on defense for most of the night and it's surely related to his ankle. He finished with seven points on 3-of-8 shooting with three assists, one rebound, one steal and one triple, but he now gets a day off to rest up for Sunday's favorable matchup vs. Brooklyn. Once he's back up to 100 percent, Bledsoe should see a bump in value with Malcolm Brogdon (quad) out 6-8 weeks.

Not coincidentally, Gobert has been strong in those four with averages of 13.0 points, 9.5 boards, 1.5 assists, 1.3 steals and 3.0 blocks. These wins are very helpful to his value because a playoff chase would help his playing time.

             He made countless winning plays in the fourth quarter and didn't seem limited by his ankle issue at all -- he reportedly had trouble putting weight on it the night before. Giannis hit 10-of-21 shots and 8-of-12 free throws, adding 11 rebounds, two assists, three steals, two blocks and one triple. He has looked like a new player since returning from a two-game absence to rest his knee and should be in the mix as the top fantasy asset going forward.

In his last four games, he's averaged 15.5 points, 6.8 boards, 7.8 assists, 1.5 steals and 1.8 treys. Sure, it's a small sample, but Rubio is starting to look like the player his owners drafted.

             Adebayo also chipped in with six assists while hitting 5-of-9 from the field. It wasn't all great, as he managed to go just 5-of-10 from the free-throw line, which was rather poor considering he is a respectable 74.5 percent from the charity stripe this season. With Hassan Whiteside checking out early due to illness, perhaps Adebayo sees an uptick in minutes Saturday in Detroit if Whiteside cannot play.

             This was a garbage-time special to a lesser degree, but there's no denying that Jackson is hot right now. He was playing so poorly about a month ago that he received a DNP-CD on Jan. 2. In the 13 games since, he's averaged 14.9 points, 4.7 boards, 1.4 assists, 0.6 steals, 0.4 blocks and 1.2 treys. He also gets a boost from the move of Devin Booker to the point and the loss of Isaiah Canaan (leg). Jackson will have slumps, but he is worth owning in standard leagues now that he's trended up for multiple weeks.

             Richardson spent time guarding Ben Simmons in this one, and perhaps all of that spent energy at the defensive end cost him a little bit offensively. The 29 minutes were his lowest since Dec. 29 when he managed just 28 minutes. Chalk this up as just one poor outings, as he has been red hot lately while seeing plenty of playing time. In fact, he has been returning fourth-round fantasy value over the past month.

            Tyler Johnson posted just nine points over 34 minutes in Friday's start at Philadelphia.
        
        
             Johnson hit just 3-of-9 from the field, including 3-of-8 from behind the arc, while adding four assists, two rebounds and just one turnover. He didn't make a lot of mistakes, he just didn't do a whole lot of positive things, either. The good news is that he hasn't been limited by the ankle he tweaked earlier in the week, so he remains a decent fantasy option in most leagues.

            Tyler Ulis scored 14 points with one rebound, two assists and two 3-pointers in 20 minutes against the Jazz on Friday.
        
        
             While garbage time did help him out, Ulis was pretty solid in the first half as Devin Booker's backup. Ulis should be the man off the bench behind Booker because of the gruesome injury to Isaiah Canaan, but he'll likely only see minutes in the teens most night. Ulis is still only a desperation add for now.

             He was trending down very quickly coming into tonight's game, as he scored six or fewer points in each of his last four outings and hasn't played over 30 minutes since Jan. 14. It makes sense for the Knicks to showcase with him the trade deadline looming because his minimum contract might be attractive to a contender, and we'd expect the Knicks to see what they have in Frank Ntilikina and Trey Burke after the All-Star break anyways. Jack isn't a great add unless you're desperate for a PG.

             He picked up a lot of minutes at center tonight because of Alex Len (ankle) struggling to get back on the court. Bender has not looked good for about three weeks before tonight, so most fantasy owners will want to see him do it again.

             The Knicks out-rebounded the Bucks 57-36 and Kanter's eight offensive boards were more than the entire Bucks' team combined (4). Kanter now has 17+ rebounds in three straight games and has been dominant for the past two weeks with 17.4 points, 13.6 rebounds and 2.3 assists in his last seven games. He has top-45 value in 9-category leagues in that span, but that's pretty much his ceiling since he's allergic to defensive stats -- he has 0.1 steals and 0.6 blocks in that same span.

             You didn't think it would be that easy, did you? Chriss looked great on Wednesday with 15 and 12, but he was just flat today. Plus, the Suns were blown out and Dragan Bender was playing well. Chriss is still worth owning, but he's not for the impatient type.

             Dragic hit 4-of-12 from the field while going 0-of-3 from behind the 3-point line, so it wasn't a very good evening. He was also a dismal minus-22, worst among all Miami players. It wasn't a very good performance for the All-Star, as he finished with just two rebounds, one assist and one steal with two turnovers. Meanwhile, All-Star snub Kemba Walker dropped 41 on Indiana. Dragic will look for better production in the second end of the back-to-back on Saturday in Detroit.

             He also missed all nine of his 3-point attempts, but at least the supporting stats were nice. THJ missed a pair of free throws down the stretch and couldn't get a clean look on his 3-point attempt at the buzzer. That's two really bad games in a row for THJ after he had four points on 1-of-10 shots on Wednesday, and that makes you wonder if he's truly healthy. There's too much upside here to cut him, and keep in mind that  he gets a great chance to redeem himself in a revenge game vs. the Hawks on Sunday.

The question is if the Lakers are doing this to showcase him in a trade or because they like him. Either way, he should be owned in standard leagues.

             The move of Julius Randle to the starting unit has hurt Kuzma a little bit, especially with Larry Nance playing well, too. Kuzma will get his recent slump sorted out and the Lakers possibly missing Brandon Ingram (groin) could help him earn run.

             He was being treated after the game for some right groin tightness and will be re-evaluated Saturday in OKC. That will probably make him a game-time decision for Sunday, but the Lakers have no reason to play him hurt. If he's out, Josh Hart gains more value while Corey Brewer and Kyle Kuzma would play more. The Lakers should probably cool it with his minutes in the upper 30s.

             He's been very underwhelming lately and it's tough to tell how the Lakers will treat him at the deadline. If you wanted to drop him in a shallower league, it's not a terrible idea. To be clear, you would have to be adding a player you know had no chance to stay on the wire for long.

However, the Celtics do have some reinforcements on the way in Greg Monroe and Morris is considered day-to-day, so Baynes could end up being a big loser in terms of fantasy. He was only relevant in deeper leagues anyways.

            Brook Lopez busted out of a terrible slump with 19 points, three rebounds, three blocks and three 3-pointers in 28 minutes against the Nets on Friday.
        
        
             Chalk up another one for the revenge-game narrative. Lopez is the Nets all-time leader for scoring and he had a tribute video today. Great game aside, he was coming off another fourth-quarter benching on Wednesday with 16 of his last 18 games having that result before tonight. We'd like to see him do it again and he has quite a hill to climb.

             VanVleet missed Thursday's game at Washington, staying home to enjoy his new child after his wife gave birth last Sunday. The fan favorite was back in action for the team's return home and he picked up right where he left off. The former Wichita State standout has been red hot lately, averaging 17.0 PPG, 3.0 RPG and 2.0 APG over his past three outings. He has splashed cold water on Delon Wright's fantasy appeal in the process.

             There's little reason to think he'll get another chance at minutes after the strong game from Josh Hart. Drop Ennis basically everywhere.

            Josh Hart pulled down a career-high 14 boards in a start with 15 points, two dimes, one steal and three 3-pointers in 35 minutes.
        
        
             He was great late on both ends and there's a very good chance this lineup sticks. Coach Luke Walton always talks about defense, which is probably why Hart found himself getting so many minutes. He'll be losing playing time once Lonzo Ball gets back, but Hart could have value for the next week or so. Although, his value would rise if Jordan Clarkson is dealt, so he's an option in 14-team leagues.

             He had four fouls which limited him to 29 minutes, but still managed to finish with at least one block, one steal and one triple for the sixth time since the new year. His ability to fill up the stat sheet in every category makes him incredibly valuable roto leagues and his owners shouldn't be worried about the arrival of Greg Monroe. If anything, Horford will love the fact that he will get to play more minutes at his more natural PF position.

             Powell hit 5-of-7 from the field, including 1-of-1 from behind the arc, while finishing with three assists and a rebound. He was getting a little extra run with C.J. Miles sidelined and the starters resting for long periods due to the lopsided score on the board. Normally Powell is only worth a look in the very deepest of fantasy formats unless head coach Dwane Casey ever makes a change and replaces OG Anunoby in the starting five with Powell.

             Siakam hit 4-of-8 from the field, including 1-of-3 from the 3-point line, while going a perfect 4-of-4 from the free-throw line. He was seeing a little extra run with the starters grabbing extra rest with the game well out of hand for most of the evening. Siakam has proven he can be a fantasy factor when given the chance, but he is still a ways off from being a must-start option.

             He came out with guns blazing to start the second half with a whopping 14 points in the first six minutes of the third quarter. Dinwiddie also played next to D'Angelo Russell more today and that combo is working. It's a super small sample in 10 minutes over the last two, but the DAR-Dinwiddie combo has a +51.0 net rating. Dinwiddie will be doing just fine.

             DeRozan played the most minutes of the five starters, mostly due to his hot hand. He was a plus-24 before checking out for good. He was a major part why the team got off to such a hot start, building a big early lead. He hit 11-of-22 from the floor, including 6-of-10 from behind the 3-point line. With a big lead, head coach Dwane Casey rested his starters for long periods of time, particularly in the second half. Despite some extra rest D-Ro still lit it up for his fantasy owners.

He has been rolling right along since his dismal scoreless performance on Jan. 20, and will look to keep it going Monday against Memphis to kick off a three-game week.

             It was the best he's looked off the dribble and he's been very confident as a scorer, making 7-of-18 from the field in this game. Although, the performance isn't there because he misses a lot of shots. Coach Kenny Atkinson has used DAR next to Spencer Dinwiddie for two games in a row now, and it may not be long before Russell is in the starting line. His 24 minutes are the most he's played since surgery and he may creep up to the upper 20s soon. Russell playing in the back-to-back set on Tuesday and Wednesday was huge, too.

            DeMarre Carroll scored seven points with one rebound, one block and four turnovers in 35 minutes against the Lakers on Friday.
        
        
             He is getting some big minutes because he's playing a lot of power forward because of no Rondae Hollis-Jefferson (groin). Carroll has been able to hold value for now, but we'd expect him to trend down once the Nets are back to full strength up front. Plus, a trade would likely hurt his value, if the Nets go that route.

             It's Jarrett Allen season and Okafor is losing some ground on him in a hurry. He still has a shot at minutes in the teens and he's playing OK, so he's not a terrible hold. He may actually hold more upside than someone like Greg Monroe, too. Okafor is more of a 16-team guy.

             He got the last shot of the game with a wing 3-pointer, but it didn't go down. Harris is seeing some clutch minutes right now, but this is shaping up to be a mess with how he'll have to compete with so many wings for minutes. Harris should take a hit, so he's a drop candidate if he's one of the worst players on your roster.

             Rozier has said many times that he wants to be a starter one day, and while that wont happen while Kyrie Irving (quad) is a Celtic, the third-year PG is making the most of his opportunity. ""But right now Im just focused in the moment whether Im a starter or not, Im just trying to play hard for my team,"" he said. Rozier had a triple-double in his only other career start on Wednesday, and while Kyrie Irving (quad) is day-to-day, Marcus Smart (hand) is expected to miss 10-14 days. Hes a strong short-term pickup and will be a must-start player if Irving misses a third game on Sunday.

             He got squeezed a bit with D'Angelo Russell and Spencer Dinwiddie playing together, and Russell's minutes are on the rise. Plus, it was bad news that guys like Joe Harris and Allen Crabbe took the clutch minutes. LeVert could get going again and perhaps he was eased in after missing a week for a groin injury, but he's certainly on thin ice as a hold. If you want to drop him for a hot add, it's not a bad idea.

             Simply put, he needs to be owned in every single fantasy league. The Nets broadcast mentioned that coach Kenny Atkinson has tried not to compare him to Kareem Abdul-Jabbar because of his how easy he is to coach and other aspects of his game, and Atkinson also said he's surprised Allen earned a starting job this soon. His offensive growth is on the rise in a big way as he continues to shine with his foot work. Allen just set a franchise record for best FG% in a month, and his patient owners may have a top-50 player going forward on their hands. Congrats to all those who stashed him.

             McCollum didn't do much from behind the 3-point line, going just 1-of-6, but he turned it over only once so fantasy owners cannot complain too vehemently about the lack of treys. He also chipped in with two rebounds, two assists and a blocked shot. He is averaging 27.0 PPG over his past five outings and will be gunning for his fifth 20-point outing in the past six when the Blazers meet the Celtics on Sunday afternoon.

Tatum has been on a heater over his last three games and is shooting 55.3% in that span. Ben Simmons and Donovan Mitchell are the frontrunners for Rookie of the Year, but Tatum has been pretty special as well.

             Chris Mannix of NBCS Boston and Yahoo Sports reported before the game that several GMs have told him that ""everyone on the roster is available"" in Atlanta, so Schroder could be on the block. Schroder is 4th in the NBA in touches per game and is the engine of Atlanta's offense, so a move would likely be bad for his fantasy value. This is firmly in the rumor stage, so his fantasy owners shouldn't do anything too drastic and should be hoping for a quiet deadline.

             He was ridiculous in the second half, playing the entire 24 minutes with 28 points to help the Hornets get the win. Walker is probably the biggest snub of any NBA player for the All-Star Game and he's been on some tear right now. Since the ESPN trade rumor story back on Jan. 19, Walker has averaged 28.6 points, 4.0 boards, 6.4 assists, 1.1 steals and 4.4 treys.

"Nicolas Batum
                 
                 
                      - G/F -  Hornets
                
                 
            
        
        
        
            Nicolas Batum scored a season-high 31 points with another season-high seven treys, adding nine rebounds an two assists in 35 minutes against the Pacers on Friday.
        
        
             After a terrible start to his season, Batum may finally be back to his usual self. Perhaps it was the lingering elbow issue or he has been prone to a slump, but he's coming off three really strong games. The Hornets reportedly want to deal him to get him off the books and a trade would likely hurt his value, especially now that he has a rhythm going.

            Jusuf Nurkic (quadriceps) was able to play in Friday's game at Toronto, finishing with 20 points.
        
        
             Nurkic wasn't hampered in the least by the injury, hitting 8-of-11 from the field and 4-of-5 from the free-throw line, finishing with seven rebounds, three assists and two steals with just one turnover. January was his best month statistically, as he nearly averaged a double-double. It appears he has carried the momentum over into February.

            Frank Kaminsky scored 15 points with six rebounds, five assists and two 3-pointers in 30 minutes against the Pacers on Friday.
        
        
             He lost run to Treveon Graham again and this time it was probable because the Hornets were playing with a lead while the Pacers went small. Marvin Williams (ankle) isn't expected to be out much longer, so Kaminsky isn't the greatest add with so many adds at the trade deadline. To be clear, he should have decent value for a couple more games, but lacks the upside.

            Taurean Prince broke out of his slump in Friday's 119-110 loss to Boston, scoring a career-high 31 points in 31 minutes.
        
        
             We told you to hang onto him after a brutal two-game stretch with a combined three points on 1-of-12 shots, so hopefully you stuck with him during the dark times. Prince hit 9-of-17 shots and 8-of-8 from the line in the loss, adding eight rebounds, two assists, three steals and matched his season-high with five triples. The Hawks were going to him over and over in the fourth quarter and hopefully we'll see him build off this performance. With Atlanta expected to have pretty much their entire roster on the trade block, Prince is poised for a big finish.

             Aminu attempted and made just one shot from the field, a 3-pointer, and he didn't have any other defensive stats. Foul trouble wasn't the issue, as he didn't have one personal. He wasn't needed, as Damian Lillard, C.J. McCollum and Jusuf Nurkic were the offensive heroes, going for 20 or more points each. Aminu is averaging just 7.8 points per game over his past four outings, hitting double digits just once.

             He lost a lot of run to Michael Carter-Williams, so that's not a good sign. MKG has been just OK in 2018, averaging 11.4 points, 3.8 boards, 1.1 assists, 1.0 steals and 0.7 turnovers in his January games. If you wanted to drop him for a higher-upside guy, it's not a bad idea.

             He was coming off one of his worst game with seven turnovers and just 13 points on Wednesday, but he turned it around for his first 30-plus scoring game since be returned from his knee injury back on Jan. 6. Oladipo was still really good in that time with 21.6 points per game since and he's been every bit of an All-Star. He'll be in the dunk contest as well.

             He was very quiet in the fourth quarter, but obviously this line works. Turner had some aggressive boards and even had a put-back dunk over two Hornets, so the knee soreness doesn't look like much of a problem. This makes it three useful games in a row for Turner with a 15-11 and a 22-4 line in his last two while bringing plenty of other stats. There's no doubt he won't meet his ADP on the year, but don't be surprised if Turner puts up early-round value going forward.

             Last year, we saw Sabonis get into one of the worst fouling slumps of anyone at times and that happened today. Couple that with Myles Turner getting hot, and it is some cause for concern. That said, Sabonis has been too good this season and coach Nate McMillan will be leaning on his two-center lineups. He's a hold in 12-team leagues.

            Terrence Jones is finalizing a 10-day deal with the Pelicans.
        
        
             Since being waived by the Bucks, Jones had a short stint in China and then made his way to the G-League where he's been lighting it up. The Pelicans missed out on the Greg Monroe sweepstakes, but they were able to bring in Nikola Mirotic. Jones can play the four and five and could potentially carve out a nice role up front, but we'll have to see how the Pelicans use him before recommending him as an add. Coach Alvin Gentry thinks Dante Cunningham is a Hall-of-Famer, but Jones is the better player and is worth keeping an eye on.

Unless you're doing well in the standings, Smart is a tough player to hold in standard leagues, especially if you don't have an I.R. spot. With Kyrie Irving battling a right quad contusion, Terry Rozier is a strong short-term pickup and is coming off a triple-double.

             That sounds like a fairly firm limit in his return, so expect him to be around 12-14 minutes. Zeller's return should take time from Johnny O'Bryant, but neither have fantasy value right now.

             He was called questionable for this game due to soreness, but thankfully he gets the green light before warmups. This is the same knee that kept him limited in December, so hopefully this doesn't linger. Expect him to start and build off his strong two-game stretch.

             In case you missed it, Westbrook shoved a fan who shouldn't have been on the court after the loss in Denver. The league made the right call here and there was only a small chance Westbrook would've been suspended, but they have been hard on players for making contact with fans for obvious reasons. Westbrook could have a monster game against the Pelicans tonight.

             For the second year in a row, the Bucks get horrible news on a day a key player comes back from injury with Jabari Parker back tonight. Last year on Feb. 8, Parker went down the same night Khris Middleton returned from a torn hamstring. The Bucks could also be without Giannis Antetokounmpo and Eric Bledsoe, so Middleton may be ridiculously busy. Besides him, we'll be seeing more Sterling Brown, Tony Snell, Matt Dellavedova and maybe even Sean Kilpatrick. Brogdon is a drop in most leagues while there really isn't a pickup to make until we get more info on Bledsoe and Giannis.

Dunn has missed the last six games and now he'll be missing at least eight, and it sounds like he may still have some symptoms. After the upcoming game on Monday, the Bulls are off until Friday, so that may serve as a fair target date. Denzel Valentine has stepped up the most and is worth a look in the short term.

             It's the front end of a back-to-back set, so this isn't surprising. With Shaun Livingston also out, we should see more Nick Young and Patrick McCaw.

             This was predictable, as Irving was sidelined on Wednesday and the Celtics are hosting the NBA's worst team, the Hawks, on Friday. Shane Larkin (knee) has also been ruled of this contest. Terry Rozier is in line to make another start and will likely log all the minutes he can handle. Rozier will be a very popular DFS play. On Wednesday, Rozier became the first player since 1972 (when the NBA began tracking starters/reserves) to record a triple-double in his first career start.

             Ulis has seen his playing time reduced of late. He logged just 11 minutes Wednesday vs. Dallas and was held scoreless. He should be sent to waivers in all standard leagues. With Ulis questionable and Isaiah Canaan (ankle) out, Devin Booker will see plenty of time at PG. The Suns may also choose to play Davon Reed or the newly signed Josh Gray.

             Gray averaged 17.9 points, 6.0 assists, 4.0 rebounds and 2.3 steals over 31 G-League games this season. He should be left on the waiver wire, as he likely won't see significant minutes for Phoenix.

             Morris crashed down on his left hip in a scary fall during Wednesday's victory over New York. He was helped off the floor and did not return to the game. Thus, it is not surprising to learn that he is unable to play on Friday. Jayson Tatum and Semi Ojeleye should see an uptick in minutes with Morris sidelined.

             Irving did not play in Wednesday's blowout victory over the Knicks due to the quad injury. With Boston hosting the Hawks, who own the worst record in the league this season, the Celtics may choose to err on the side of caution and sit Irving out on Friday. The C's next game is Sunday afternoon vs. Portland. If Irving is ruled out, Terry Rozier would likely make another start. Rozier exploded for 17 points,  11 rebounds and ten assists in 33 minutes on Wednesday.

He was the fourth center on the depth chart and not a part of the rotation, so this does not have a fantasy impact.

The Pelicans traded a first-round pick for Mirotic and also guaranteed his 2018-19 salary of $12.5 million, which means they have a lot invested in him. He will likely see minutes in the mid-to-high 20's right away and should be owned in all standard-sized leagues.

             Rivers has not played since initially suffering the injury back on December 29th. Milos Teodosic will continue to log plenty of minutes at point guard with Rivers sidelined. However, the trade deadline is February 8th, which means the Clippers roster could look different by the time Rivers returns. There is a strong possibility Lou Williams will be traded by this time next week, which would open up plenty of minutes in the Clippers backcourt.

            Giannis Antetokounmpo said he twisted his ankle pretty badly on Thursday.
        
        
             He was having trouble putting weight on it after the game and had a limp. The Bucks are almost certainly going to be missing Malcolm Brogdon (quad tendon), but they will get Jabari Parker (knee) back and hopefully Eric Bledsoe (ankle) will be OK.  This stings even worse because the Bucks were down big late.

             He submitted his case for ankle-breaker of the year when he dropped Steven Adams for a step-back trey (video in link below). Murray's game has become more well-rounded than ever as he continues to destroy guys off the dribble while adding plenty of treys. In his last seven, he boasts a very nice 69.1 TS% on a 25.1 usage rate, averaging 23.7 points, 4.7 boards, 4.6 assists and 3.3 treys in those seven since returning from a concussion. He's still just 20 years old and he's getting better every day. The breakout is real and it's spectacular.

             If you missed this game, you may have missed the best game of the year with Harris hitting a deep trey over Russell Westbrook on an ATO with 1.4 seconds left (video in link below). After the game, Harris said he last game winner like that was in pickup ball. He hasn't been used much in the clutch this season with only a 17.0 usage rate during those 54 minutes, but that may change after this. He's having an amazing year in reality and in fantasy with early-round output.

             Coach Mike Malone wanted defense out there, so that explains the dip in minutes. Lyles still added some defense himself and he should have another opportunity on Saturday against the Warriors. With Mason Plumlee out for weeks and not days, he should have value for most of this month.

             It looked like George was going to have the shot of the night with a 3-pointer to tie it at 124, but Gary Harris had other ideas at the buzzer. He also didn't go to the line in this game to make him the first player to score more than 40 without an FT attempt since Wally Szczerbiak in 2003. He's trending up and he could be very busy if Russell Westbrook can't play Friday.

             The dimes were great, that's his second 20-20 the season, and he was electric down the stretch, but the last minutes of the game were the takeaway here. Westbrook was burned by Gary Harris for a game-winning three and Nikola Jokic saw that. ""I think Russell fell asleep,"" Jokic said on TNT. After the loss, Westbrook shoved a fan on the court and there's no doubt the league will be looking at this (video in link below). Obviously the fan shouldn't have been there, but the NBA doesn't want its players pushing fans. His fantasy owners will want to make sure he's a go for Friday night because of a possible suspension.

             It wasn't your typical win for the Rockets and Harden will tell you they won it with defense. ""All night, we were locked in. We got stops,"" Harden said.

            Luc Mbah a Moute made another start on Thursday with nine points, four rebounds, two assists, two steals and one 3-pointer in 35 minutes against the Spurs.
        
        
             He's seen some serious minutes in his last two games with this and a 39-minute Tuesday. Mbah a Moute is more of a glue guy than a fantasy asset, so he'll have to make his money in the hustle stats. He's more of a stream while Trevor Ariza and Eric Gordon are out.

             The minutes were there again after Tucker put up nine points, three rebounds, one assist and three 3-pointers in 36 minutes. He'll probably have a couple more games like this one with Trevor Ariza on the shelf, so give him a look if this kind of line appeals to you. It probably shouldn't.

             He basically stepped right into Eric Gordon's role with similar usage and plenty of treys with Green's 11 attempts tonight. He'll probably have a couple more chances to produce with Gordon having chronic back problems and Trevor Ariza expected to miss more time, too. He doesn't have much long-term upside, so you may not want to add him because of so many adds right now.

             We've talked about the Danny Green Roller Coaster before and that ride still works. Green only played nine minutes on Sunday and coach Gregg Popovich said he wasn't hurt. Green will have lines like this on occasion, which has helped him flirt with top-100 value despite being maddeningly inconsistent.

             While he did start, he came off the bench to start the third for Patty Mills. The Rockets will cause teams to change their starters for the third tonight, and coach Gregg Popovich mentioned the Spurs needed more offense in his sideline interview. Gasol should be around top-100 value going forward.

             He did close this game out and had to guard Blake Griffin a bunch. Green was out since Jan. 22, so chances are his playing time will be closer to 30 when the Grizzlies play again on Sunday. His upside isn't the greatest, but Green is a decent pickup if you missed the boat on a lot of the hotter adds this week.

             He continues his work on the glass with double-digit boards in three straight. Murray's offense hasn't been there with no points in Tuesday's win over the Nuggets and just 8.2 points per game over his last five. He does have some holes in his game for both fantasy and reality, but he has a chance to flirt with top-100 value.

             Oh hey KAT has a good game and the Wolves roll. Before tonight, Towns had seen his usage take a massive hit in the last seven games, but not today. The common thread in those seven games was that he couldn't even hit a 16 usage rate in the first half to limit him over that span. That wasn't the case tonight with KAT feasting before half, scoring 17 points, eight boards and three dimes. The All-Star will be just fine as he makes his case to be fantasy's top player for total value.

             He looks exactly like the pre-injury version of himself. In his four games since returning from a knee issue, Butler averaged 24.5 points, 5.5 boards, 5.0 assists, 1.0 steals and 1.5 treys on 45.9 percent from the field and 81.8 percent from the line -- 11.0 attempts per game, too.

             It's probably not a coincidence that Wiggins' scoring has dropped in every game since his 21-point night against the Nets when Jimmy Butler returned. He's still going to get huge minutes and at least he has steals in five of his last six. Expect him to be more of a mid-to-late round player in nine-cat leagues.

             It was a bad night for the Bucks all around, and now once again it looks like they lost a key piece near another player's return.

Middleton should be a stud regardless.

He's still only a catch-and-shoot specialist, and obviously the demand won't be going up too much with this dud.

             He'll be asked to play more now because it would appear Malcolm Brogdon (quad tendon) will be missing games. On the other hand, he'll only be taking the occasional open trey with a handful of dimes. If your fantasy league has grit as a category, give Delly a look. For the rest of us, you can probably do better with so many fantasy pickups right now.

             No John Wall, no problem. Beal was frozen cold in the first half, but busted out for 25 in the second half to earn his third straight win all without his fellow All-Star. Before the game, Beal said he thought the Raptors were the best team in the Eastern Conference. Beal is going to absolutely feast in the next two months based on his 31.9 usage rate in his minutes without Wall while his assist numbers are also up -- he has even played point guard this week. He has a great chance at top-10 value.

             He did have a fall on his back/hip, but Porter looked to be OK and stayed in the game. Unlike some other Wizards, Porter hasn't busted out while John Wall is on the bench, but the opportunity should still be there. Expect him to trend up. Considering all of his hip injuries, his owners will want to make sure he's not on the injury report.

             He has been a huge letdown so far with Wall down, especially after what he did with Bradley Beal and no Wall before the announcement of Wall's surgery.

He should still be held in all standard leagues.

             He still hasn't totally looked right and he wasn't exactly thrilled about being asked about his health after the game. ""We ain't talking about that, man,"" he said. Morris is a slight winner from the John Wall injury because other players have to slide to other positions, so he's probably worth owning in standard leagues. He also gets a 3.3 usage rate boost when Wall is off the court, so that helps.

             He's not going to be lighting up the scoring column, but Satoransky has been an effective stat stuffer so far. In the three games without John Wall, he averaged 8.3 points, 4.7 boards, 5.7 dimes, 1.3 steals and 1.0 treys. The Wizards are reportedly not expected to make a deal for a guy like Lou Williams or Tyreke Evans, so Satoransky could have value for two months. He's worth a look if you need a non-scoring point guard.

             The bad news is he missed a free throw with the Raptors down two with three seconds left. The good news is that this is a long overdue strong offensive game after he averaged just 10.8 points per game in his last four. Lowry has been down compared to last year, but all will be forgiven if he can stay on the floor as the Raptors go for the top seed.

             That's not good and Brogdon may have said he heard a pop when he suffered the injury. He's almost certainly going to miss time here and the Bucks have seven games to go before the All-Star break. There's no official word, but Brogdon almost certainly has an appointment for an MRI on Friday. If he's out, Tony Snell and Matt Dellavedova could step up until Eric Bledsoe (ankle) gets back.

             This one is tough to swallow for the Delon hive, especially with Fred VanVleet out of the lineup. Wright could heat up in a hurry, but feel free to drop him for a hot free agent.

            Blake Griffin's Pistons debut was a successful one during a 104-102 win against the Grizzlies on Thursday, scoring 24 points with 10 rebounds, two blocks, no turnovers and one 3-pointer in 35 minutes.
        
        
             This was a huge win for the Pistons as they basically just had to throw their game plan together on the fly. After the game,  Griffin said the Pistons only ran four plays throughout the night when he was on the floor because those were the main ones they went over in shootaround. It was also surprising that he closed this game out for the final three minutes while Andre Drummond was on the sidelines. You really couldn't ask for much more out of Griffin and he'll be flirting with early-round value as long as he's active.

            Andre Drummond scored 14 points, 15 rebounds, three assists, three steals and one block in 28 minutes against the Grizzlies on Thursday.
        
        
             We did get a surprise down the stretch with Anthony Tolliver closing over Drummond for basically the last 3:09 -- Drummond was in for a couple rebounding chances on free throws. Perhaps most notably, Drummond was not on the court for the biggest defensive play of the game when the Grizzlies had the ball down one with 20 seconds left. He did look comfortable with Blake Griffin and even had a dunk off a Griffin dime, but Drummond may take a hit with Blake around. Perhaps the craziest stat on Drummond's adjustment is how 58 percent of his assists went to Tobias Harris or Avery Bradley before the trade. To be clear, Drummond is still going to be a monster.

             He had one of the biggest plays of the game with a steal that led to a Johnson assist on an Andre Drummond dunk to tie the game at 94. Johnson did make his mistakes earlier in the game, but coach Stan Van Gundy seems to trust him for now. We'll see if the Pistons do shop Johnson and maybe there's a market for him after this game and a 26-point Tuesday. He's not a must-add grab based on how he was a ghost for the first three months of the season, but give him a look to see if he magically fixed himself. Stranger things have happened.

             Besides the lack of defensive stats, Bullock was right there for his usual usage and minutes. He's been shooting at an unsustainably high rate, but he's still going to be the main floor-spacing shooter in the first unit. Bullock should be owned in standard leagues.  By the way, he and Blake Griffin have a 3-0 record when they start together.

             Those numbers are slightly down from what he did in January, averaging 12.4 points 5.3 dimes and 0.3 treys. Smith will be losing some ball-handling responsibility and Reggie Jackson should be able to make it back this month. If you want to make a proactive cut for a red-hot add and don't care too much about the next two weeks, it's not the worst idea to move on from Ish.

He's really just a one-category guy and it's not like he make many 3-pointers anyway, so he's way down the pickup rankings. If you added him, there's a good chance you'll find something better out there.

             Make that his 21st double-double of the year to put him on pace for his best double-double season in is career (28 in 2009-10). The Grizzlies can't get into the win column and Gasol is under a lot of pressure for trade rumors. He doesn't like to talk about it and said he has enough on his plate when asked about Tyreke Evans on Wednesday. There's a chance he is dealt, but the Grizzlies would have to accept an offer they can't refuse. For what it's worth, they may not even take a deal from the Cavs for Tristan Thompson and the Nets pick, per reports.

             It was one of his best games of the season with a lot of quality buckets in halfcourt, which is surprising because he's only a 20th-percentile scorer in halfcourt this season (Synergy). Harrison has now strung together five decent games, averaging 12.6 points, 3.2 boards, 5.8 assists, 0.4 steals and 0.8 treys. He's not much of a shooter and his steals are down, so Harrison is only a lukewarm pickup even with Tyreke Evans done on Memphis.

             He still saw some heavy minutes at point guard and he did close this game out. J.B. Bickerstaff has been staggering him with Andrew Harrison, and the coach seems to like Selden right at 31 minutes with him hitting that mark for three straight. With Tyreke Evans headed out of town and possibly the same for Mario Chalmers' expiring deal, the Grizzlies will want to get a long look at Selden to figure out where he fits for next season. He's worth an add in most 12-team formats.

            Deyonta Davis scored 12 points with eight rebounds, one assist and one block in 15 minutes against the Pistons on Thursday.
        
        
             He had a big block on an Andre Drummond post up and the soreness in both of his knees didn't look to be apparent here. Davis does look to be a head of Brandan Wright, who could also be traded. Davis does still need a few things to happen to break out, but he's a decent stash if the Grizzlies do get a haul for Marc Gasol.

             He gave us a mild scare with a leg injury in the fourth quarter on Wednesday, but it sounds like he'll be OK. Nurkic is playing some of his best ball of the season, but the problem is that Ed Davis is doing the same.

             Presumably, this is from his bad fall a few days ago. He is only used situationally and he probably wouldn't be getting more than 10 minutes against the Raptors anyway. Leave Harkless on the wire.

             He was on a breakaway layup and it didn't look good. Brogdon took about a step after the injury likely occurred, but he went down in a heap after that. After the staff looked at him, he went straight to the locker room. He's probably not going to be returning tonight and hopefully he can be ready this weekend. Matt Dellavedova could play more, but he's not a pickup here.

             The 24-year-old guard moves up from the G League to help replace Isaiah Canaan. Gray is undersized at just 6'1"", so apparently the Suns like short backup point guards.

Leave him on the wire in all leagues for now, though.

            Chris Paul (groin) will play without a minutes limit against the Spurs on Thursday.
        
        
             While there isn't a cap on him, coach Mike D'Antoni said he'd like to keep CP3 around 30 minutes. The last time Paul returned from an injury, he played 26 minutes after missing three games. This injury isn't as severe, so his owners should have him at close to 100 percent in this game.

             He has been working out, but this report adds he's still hobbled. It's fair to say he's not going to return until after the trade deadline, and several reports say he's on the trade block. With him out, it's been Royce O'Neale playing really well, which has capped Alec Burks from producing in fantasy.

The Grizzlies may have submitted their nominee for funkiest lineup of the year with Myke Henry and Jarell Martin at the two and three for a brief time on Wednesday. With Ennis back, that'll go away, which means Henry and Ben McLemore could lose some minutes. We still like Wayne Selden.

With Green back, this should push Jarell Martin back to the bench and chances are Brandan Wright won't play some PF minutes like he did on Wednesday. Green could be worth a look, but he needs to start playing well to deserve a pickup in most leagues.

             That means he'll be clearing waivers on Saturday. For now, the Pelicans look to be the heavy favorites to land Monroe, which would be a terrific landing spot for him. Anthony Davis said he's ""OK"" playing center, but maybe he doesn't want to play exclusively at that spot. Monroe is probably going to come off the bench and he could be looking at minutes in the low 20s. He's worth an add in most formats, but he doesn't offer the upside like some of the other red-hot pickups like Jarrett Allen or even Wayne Selden. Plus, the Celtics could swoop in and land him, which would destroy his fantasy value.

             ""I mean, especially on the court, I can be very visible, with my emotions [showing on my face],"" Lopez said about not playing in the fourth. ""So yeah, just trying to control myself, breathe a little bit, and just keep cool because it was an unfortunate game for us."" This makes it the 16th time in the last 18 games he didn't play in the fourth, so this is a clear trend. Lopez finished with just nine minutes and he's a drop candidate these days. Maybe a trade can save him.

Cauley-Stein missed the last two games due to a deep bone bruise because he hit his knee on Hassan Whiteside's knee brace back on Jan. 25, so the Kings having their games spaced out may keep him to just two games out. He's probably going to be a game-time decision against the Warriors, which means Kosta Koufos and Zach Randolph take big hits.

             He is not expected to play this week as the Nets allow his groin injury to heal. While it's not serious, the Nets almost always err on the side of caution at any chance. Quincy Acy has stepped up as the starting power forward with DeMarre Carroll sliding over to the four at times, which allows some wing minutes to guys like Joe Harris. Acy is more of a deep-league stream. RHJ is still a hold.

             It sounds like he'll be back after missing three games since Saturday. He's in a very interesting spot coming back because coach Kenny Atkinson finally unleashed the D'Angelo Russell and Spencer Dinwiddie combo on Wednesday. Don't be surprised to see DAR start to make LeVert the backup PG. He's more of a drop than an add these days.

             Maybe the Bulls keep him today, but they'll probably be looking to trade him for almost anything they can get. Expect for Nelson to wind up on a contender that is lacking depth at guard. He will probably want some playing time.

             He did not play on Tuesday due to a minor groin injury with the Rockets being careful against the Magic. Paul downplayed his injury before Tuesday, so there's little reason to think he'll be limited. He should be back in all lineups and he'll be giving Dejounte Murray a tough time on the other end.

             No surprise here with Gordon dealing with a back injury in almost every year since 2011. With him out, Gerald Green will basically slide right into Gordon's minutes and take plenty of shots. Luc Mbah a Moute and P.J.

Bradley will need to put in a full practice before he gets a green light, but he's currently on track to play. He will probably start, which would bump G League gem Tyrone Wallace could move to the bench.

It sounds like he will be targeting after the All-Star break, which means Paul Millsap (wrist) could be back before him. Trey Lyles is worth owning in most leagues while Torrey Craig should continue to see some run.

Although, Dragic does have a -3.7 net rating on the season while Josh Richardson sits at +0.7 and has played in every game. Besides this stuff, you certainly could make a really strong case for Kemba Walker or Ben Simmons.

             He has knee soreness and Miles tends to get banged up a lot, so he's probably out. Norman Powell filled in nicely for Miles on Tuesday, but he's still not much of a fantasy add. He's a possible punt play in DFS, though.

             This is to his shooting hand and maybe that's why he was somewhat quiet with 11 points in his start for Marvin Williams (ankle). With Williams out again, Kaminsky should be set up for minutes in the 30s with a chance at a double-double. There are a lot of high-upside players out there, so Kaminsky isn't the hottest pickup out there.

             The Hornets rule him out early for the second game in a row, which means he could be out for additional time. Plus, he's reportedly on the trade block and that could be a factor in bringing him back. While Frank Kaminsky started on Wednesday, it was Treveon Graham who picked up the minutes. If you wanted to drop Marvin for all the hot pickups, it's not a terrible idea in shallower leagues.

Zeller was averaging 7.2 points, 5.5 rebounds and 1.1 blocks in 19.9 minutes per game as Dwight Howard's backup prior to the injury, so while there's not much fantasy appeal here, he might become interesting later in the season if the Hornets tank.

Ball hasn't returned to practice yet, but we keep hearing that he's making progress. They return to Los Angeles on Tuesday to take on the Suns, so maybe he makes it back for that one. Jordan Clarkson will continue to benefit in his absence and the Lakers will use this opportunity to showcase him for a potential trade -- they would like to clear as much salary as possible to prepare for free agency this summer.

            Tony Allen, Jameer Nelson and Omer Asik have been traded to the Bulls in exchange for Nikola Mirotic.
        
        
             The Bulls are expected to waive Allen, as they are rebuilding and have no use for a 36-year-old veteran with very little left in the tank. It's not a lock that a contender will pick him up if he's waived and he still hasn't fully recovered from his fibula fracture.

             He was previously listed as doubtful and never really had a shot to play tonight. His status for Friday's game vs. the Knicks is also in danger. With Bledsoe out, we should see more of Malcolm Brogdon, Matthew Dellavedova and maybe even Jason Terry, but Brogdon is the only guy you can trust in most fantasy formats.

            The Pelicans have finalized a deal for Nikola Mirotic according to ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski.
        
        
             The Pelicans are also planning to guarantee the $12.5M salary of Mirotic for the 2018-19 season, so this isn't just a rental. New Orleans will send Chicago a 2018 first-round pick with ""minimal"" protections in addition to Tony Allen, Jameer Nelson and Omer Asik. The Pelicans cleared a roster spot with this move, opening the door for them to also bring in Greg Monroe. This is a solid landing spot for Mirotic and he will give the Pelicans some much needed floor spacing to open things up for Anthony Davis. He's definitely worth owning in standard leagues.

             He was also questionable on Wednesday before he was ruled out. Davis has been on the injury report with these concerns for a while, so maybe they use this opportunity to showcase Brandan Wright for a trade. Davis is someone to keep an eye on in case Marc Gasol is moved.

             Ennis has missed seven games in a row with a calf issue, so it's notable that he's no longer listed on the injury report for that reason. The Grizzlies are going to be shorthanded tonight with Chandler Parsons (knee) still without a timetable, JaMychal Green (ankle) considered questionable and Tyreke Evans resting until the deadline. Ennis is just someone to keep an eye on in deeper leagues, as Wayne Selden and Dillon Brooks appear to be the best wing options in Memphis for now.

             Green has missed five games in a row, but he was always expected to return this week. If Green can't go, that means we should see him on Sunday instead. On the flip side, Jarrell Martin would lose some streaming appeal if Green is active. Prior to the injury, Green had January averages of 11.4 points, 10.0 rebounds, 1.1 assists, 0.9 steals and 0.9 treys.

Deyonta Davis (left and right knee soreness), James Ennis III (illness) and JaMychal Green (right ankle) are all questionable, while Chandler Parsons (knee) remains out. Andrew Harrison logged heavy minutes as the starting PG on Wednesday and is a streaming option on Thursday, while Wayne Selden logged minutes at both PG and SG and went off for 24 points and six triples. Selden is the better pickup, but both players are on the radar with Memphis sitting Tyreke Evans until the deadline.

The Pelicans can offer him the chance to start at center with DeMarcus Cousins (Achilles) out for the season, something the Celtics, Spurs or maybe even the Wizards can't do. Monroe is expected to make a decision as soon as Friday or Saturday and his fantasy owners should be rooting for a move to New Orleans.

Collison is having a sneaky good season as the starting PG in Indiana with 12.9 points, 5.3 assists, 2.7 rebounds, 1.4 steals and 1.3 triples, and obtaining him would be a low-risk move since he has a player option for 2018-19.

            Myles Turner is questionable for Friday's game vs. the Hornets with a sore right knee.
        
        
             He did have some soreness in the same knee in early December, but he didn't miss any time. The injuries are really starting to pile up for Turner and he's now had issues with his knee, elbow, thigh and calf to go with a concussion this season. If he can't play, Domantas Sabonis would benefit the most and slide into the starting lineup.

            Joe Johnson ""is angling behind the scenes"" for a trade out of Utah according to Marc Stein of the New York Times.
        
        
             The Jazz are three losses behind the No. 8 seed in Denver, so their playoff hopes are still very much alive. However, they aren't close to being a contender right now and Johnson is no spring chicken. If the Jazz are unable to find him a new home, he could very easily become a buyout candidate. A move to a contender wouldn't be great news for his fantasy value, but he's not a 12-team asset anyways.

             We're expected to get another update on Thursday evening, but it sounds like he might need screws to stabilize the fracture in his left hand. He's still looking at a 6-8 week timetable, so his owners still have a chance of getting him back before the end of the fantasy playoffs.

             It sounds like the Pelicans and Celtics are the current favorites, but there should be at least a few more playoff-bound teams that will throw their names in the hat.

With VanVleet out, Delon Wright will see a bump in minutes as the backup PG and it's possible Norman Powell enters the rotation.

             This makes a lot of sense for both sides. Monroe is a New Orleans native and could see significant minutes as a DeMarcus Cousins (Achilles) replacement. Assuming he clears waivers, the Pelicans will be one of many teams knocking on his door. ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski said the Celtics are also a potential destination and can use part of their $8.4 million disabled player exception from the Gordon Hayward (leg) injury. In terms of fantasy, a move to New Orleans would be better for his fantasy value.

             Oh boy. Haynes adds some more detail here, reporting James would listen if Golden State explored ways to clear the necessary cap space out. Haynes has covered both the Cavs and Warriors, and he also broke the Gordon Hayward news, so this is credible. The more the Cavs lose, the more we'll be hearing stories like this one.

             He did look to have some protection on his rib and he did look limited at times. Booker did also make all three from the line tonight, which gives 56 made freebies in a row to put him just three back of the franchise record. With Isaiah Canaan out for the year, Booker is now likely looking at major run at point guard. Once he gets over this rib injury, he could start to heat up again.

             The lineup move was a big success and coach Jay Triano really seems to be coming around on Jackson. Earlier this week, he said he liked how he produced offense in the open floor and he likes how he attacks the basket. Of course, the key to Jackson's minutes will be his defense, and he had that in spades today with great isolation and PNR defense. He's playing well enough to add in most standard leagues, but just know he'll probably have some bad games mixed in going forward.

             He's getting some center minutes and that could continue with Alex Len (ankle) hurt and Greg Monroe bought out. Bender really flopped while Marquese Chriss was out, so it'll take a lot for the fantasy community to trust him again. If you want to add him, make sure your expectations are low.

             He brought the energy on both ends in what was easily his best game since he hurt his hip back on Jan. 7. He missed six games for that ailment, and then missed one game for an ankle tweak on Jan. 29. Chriss was a disaster in the two games in between injuries with just five points combined. He's one of the most inconsistent players in the NBA, but he was really starting to heat up before the hip issue. Go ahead and add him.

Smith Jr. has really played well since his triple-double 16 games ago back on Dec. 29 and he's hit double-digit scoring in each. It's becoming very clear DSJ has his coach's trust late in the game and he scored seven points in the final four minutes. In his last 15 games, DSJ has a whopping 31.0 usage rate and a 64.1 TS%. Expect a strong finish, especially if he can up his percentages early in games.

             He's just the second player in the last 40 seasons to drop a triple-double in his first career NBA start -- usage-rate stud Tony Wroten will live on forever. Rozier also matched Kyrie Irving's one triple-double in his career, and it's possible Irving misses additional time with how well Rozier played. After the game, Rozier did joke that he'll give Irving his job back when he's ready, but he said he wants to be a starter. ""Not trying to toot my own horn or anything because I got a triple-double in my first start but thats what I truly believe and thats my goal,"" Rozier said. He should clean up while Irving and Marcus Smart are out.

             Markkanen is day-to-day and there's no long-term upside for Zipser. He was actually benched to start the second half, with Bobby Portis taking his place, which is no surprise since Chicago was destroyed to begin this game. Zipser shouldn't be owned in any fantasy leagues.

             The Bulls held out Nikola Mirotic as a precaution tonight and he'll be a DNP-CD until Chicago finalizes a trade, so he's effectively out of the picture. Lauri Markkanen (personal) was also out tonight, and Portis could have had a bigger line if he started the game -- Paul Zipser got the start, although Portis did replace him to begin the third quarter. Portis was already a high-upside stash going into the trade deadline, and this crystallizes his value. Make sure he's not still on your waiver wire.

             The Bulls fell behind 20-2 in the opening minutes and were never really competitive, so we're not reading into LaVine's playing time -- he logged 22 minutes tonight, after playing 26 minutes on Friday and Sunday. Three of his makes came from downtown and he turned the ball over just once, so this is another step in the right direction. The best is yet to come.

            Meyers Leonard (sore back) was in uniform on Wednesday but he didn't leave the Blazers' bench.
        
        
             Portland cruised to a blowout victory at home tonight and they deployed 12 different players, so Leonard's DNP appears to have been injury-related. Even at full strength, though, he's not a fantasy asset.

             McCollum scored 28 points in the first quarter alone, which was the most ever scored in a single quarter against the Bulls. He also broke Damian Lillard's single-quarter scoring record for the Blazers, and might have gone for 60+ if this game wasn't a complete blowout. He's the seventh player in franchise history with at least 50 points in a game, joining Lillard, Clyde Drexler, Geoff Petrie, Andre Miller, Brandon Roy and Damon Stoudamire. He's held top-50 roto value all season and is about as steady as they come for fantasy purposes.

             The Celtics went with some wacky lineups and even had one that had no guards at all -- Ojeleye was in that one. He's been a little inconsistent, but coach Brad Stevens has to like how he can play him in three positions.

             While he did have a minutes limit in this game, the Knicks didn't need to push him due to the blowout loss. Hardaway Jr. sat out of the first half of a back-to-back set on Jan. 25 because the team medical staff was in his ear, but this time he got the green light. He should be set to go for the foreseeable future.

             The Cavs lost Kevin Love (hand) for approximately 6-8 weeks, which should clarify Thomas' role as the No. 2 option offensively. The steals helped boost his line tonight, and fantasy owners have no choice but to follow IT's own advice and remain patient. ""Coming back, I just want it all right now, and that's just not realistic,"" he said. ""I know one day soon it'll come back, and I'll be the player I've always been."" He has demonstrated early-round upside, so hang in there.

            Channing Frye made 6-of-9 FGs and 2-of-2 FTs en route to 16 points on Wednesday, with four rebounds, two 3-pointers, one assist, one steal and one block.
        
        
             The Cavs reportedly don't want to trade Frye because he can help fill the gap left by Kevin Love's absence for 6-8 weeks. He logged 21 minutes tonight and did his damage both from distance and in the paint -- when asked about his success as a roll-man, he replied, ""Normally [teams] catch wind of that play after one or two times. It kept working. I'm going to have to get new shoes. I wore the tread out tonight."" His real-world value far exceeds his fantasy appeal, however, and he's just a 3-point specialist in deep leagues.

            Nicolas Batum scored 10 points with 11 rebounds, 10 assists, two steals and one 3-pointer in a triple-double against the Hawks on Wednesday.
        
        
             That's the eighth triple-double of his career and his fourth as a Hornet to pass Baron Davis for third-most in franchise history. Batum was coming into this one playing well this month, averaging 13.4 points, 4.2 boards, 4.2 assists and 1.5 treys. His fantasy value probably won't change too much after the deadline even if Kemba Walker is dealt.

             Whiteside tied Rony Seikaly for third in Heat history in blocks tonight (610), although he has a long way to go to catch Dwyane Wade (759), let alone Alonzo Mourning (1,625). That's where the good news ends, as Whiteside has now effectively been a DNP-CD in five fourth quarters this month. He's still racking up top-30 value in just 25.8 minutes over the past month, so there's no reason to panic -- this is also reminder of his upside if he's ever truly unleashed.

             Ellington came in with 52 made 3-pointers in January, which tied his own team record for triples in a month, but he simply couldn't get one to drop tonight. This is only the fourth game since Nov. 1 that he's failed to hit a 3-pointer, so fantasy owners can expect the 30-year-old to come out firing vs. Philly on Friday.

He's been proficient from deep this season with 0.6 triples on 42.6% shooting, but unless his playing time increases he's hard to roster in standard leagues.

             Olynyk went 5-of-12 from the field tonight and his line would have looked much better if he'd connected from distance -- he was 0-of-6 beyond the arc. He's slumping from deep lately and this is the first time all season he's missed at least six 3-point attempts, but Miami wants him to continue firing away as a big man who can stretch the court. He's worth holding in most leagues, especially with Hassan Whiteside's name coming up in trade rumors.

             He's played mostly power forward this year, so it wasn't a tough adjustment. Plus, coach Steve Clifford has used Kaminsky with the other four starters before, so he should continue to start until Williams can get back. His upside isn't the greatest and the waiver wire is on fire, so there's probably a better add out there.

             Tyler Zeller is falling out of the rotation and it looks like Brooklyn has committed to staggering Okafor and Jarrett Allen at center. Okafor is on the waiver wire in plenty of leagues due to his inconsistent role in Brooklyn, but he's trending up and is at least worth a glance if you need a center, particularly in points leagues.

             This was the second half of a back-to-back set for the Nets. It's encouraging that Russell was even cleared to play, and he rewarded that faith with his best game since returning from knee surgery on Jan. 19. Head coach Kenny Atkinson praised him afterward, saying, ""Very encouraging, and again, you can still see some rust ... I give him credit, he really pushed to play."" There will be ups and downs, but he's moving in the right direction.

             It was a game rife with career-high numbers for Allen, who recently overtook Tyler Zeller (seven minutes) for the starting center job. Over the past five games he's made 25-of-30 field goals (83.3%), averaging 12.4 points, 7.6 rebounds and 1.0 blocks in that span. The 19-year-old's role should only increase late in the season, and he clearly shouldn't be languishing on your waiver wire.

             He did get some point-guard run because of Dennis Schroder dealing with a shoulder injury. Bazemore has easily been the best player on the Hawks, and it'll be interesting to see how the Hawks view him as a future piece. It's certainly possible he's dealt, but his owners shouldn't be selling him at a discount because of it. He looks like a must-start player the rest of the way.

             ""Itll be weird for sure [to play vs. Philly], just because I spent 2 1/2 years there,"" Stauskas said before the game. ""Im still pretty close to some of the guys on the team. But most importantly I just want to get a win."" Brooklyn did emerge victorious, 116-108, but this snapped a two-game streak of double-digit scoring for Stauskas. He's only worth owning if you're in dire need of scoring and 3-pointers.

             He's been a little quiet since last month because he's not playing as much center. With the Hawks reportedly ""open for business"" this week, that should mean at least one center is off the roster, which would allow more minutes/shots. Collins could really start to take off very soon.

             Covington hit a 3-pointer tonight but he may have been gun-shy due to his brutal slump in January -- he's shooting just 37.1% from the field, and was 26.7% in his previous three games. His shooting percentages have trended down every month this season, but this with his trade value bottoming out, owners might as well wait for him to bounce back. For encouragement, consider his splits from last season -- 38.3% shooting before the All-Star break, 43.7% after the break.

             Booker tweaked his knee on Sunday but he hasn't missed any time, playing 13 minutes on Monday and 14 minutes tonight. The veteran doesn't have fantasy appeal while Philly's frontcourt is healthy, but at least he's healthy.

             Simmons has scored double-digit points in 41 games this season, which leads the Sixers and ranks second among rookies behind Lauri Markkanen. He's been better than advertised in fantasy leagues this season, particularly in leagues that don't penalize his turnovers (3.6 per game) and free-throw shooting (61.0% on 3.7 attempts). There's no reason to think that will change in Philly's final 33 games.

             Coach Mike Budenholzer said Schroder suffered a sore shoulder on some first-half play tonight, but said even Schroder didn't know exactly when it happened. He had a huge wrap on his shoulder in the fourth, but he did come back out there before it got to garbage time. If he's limited, Malcolm Delaney will benefit. The Hawks play the Celtics on Friday.

             Embiid sat out on Monday in the second half of a back-to-back set, though it sounds like he might soon be cleared to play in consecutive games. He shot 8-of-19 from the field and 12-of-14 from the line tonight, and posted a plus/minus rating of +9, but the end result was a tough road loss in Orlando. If you drafted Embiid this season, chances are you got him at a steep discount.

             Philly welcomed J.J. Redick (leg) back into the starting lineup tonight, so the writing was on the wall for Luwawu. If nothing else, the second-year swingman proved he can step up when needed -- in seven starts this season, he's averaged 10.6 points, 2.4 triples, 1.7 rebounds, 2.3 assists, 0.3 steals and 0.3 blocks. There's no lasting fantasy upside in re-draft leagues, though.

            Bismack Biyombo navigated foul trouble to finish Wednesday's game with five points, six rebounds, one assist and one turnover in 31 minutes.
        
        
             Nobody else on the Magic roster logged more than 27 minutes, but Biyombo couldn't quite take advantage of his playing time -- he went 2-of-4 from the field and 1-of-4 from the line without any defensive stats. The bigger issue is that Nikola Vucevic (hand) should be ready to go after the All-Star break, if not sooner. If you own Biyombo, enjoy the production while it lasts.

             While he didn't close this one, Delaney could be on the radar in the short term with Dennis Schroder hurting his shoulder. He's only a speculative add in very deep leagues. He's also closed at point guard and he did start the third quarter on the wing over Taurean Prince on Monday.

             Augustin turned the ball over twice in 21 minutes and he's quietly carved out steady playing time in Orlando, despite being a 30-year-old guard on a rebuilding team. Even if he does maintain his 20-minute role after the trade deadline, which is far from certain, he's only worth monitoring in leagues with 16+ teams.

A trade would likely destroy his fantasy value, so his owners don't have to be tied to him. There are a ridiculous amount of pickups these days.

             It was Mike Muscala getting the nod at the five to start the third. The Hawks are expected to be dealing their veterans, which means it should be time for a youth movement. Maybe Plumlee won't be in the rotation in the near future.

             Speights started in place of Aaron Gordon (strained hip flexor), which bumped Mario Hezonja back to the bench. The veteran big man sank 6-of-11 field goals and 6-of-7 free throws, and he's now averaging 19.0 points over the past two games.

             Aaron Gordon (hip) was out tonight but the Magic opted for a big frontcourt with Marreese Speights alongside Bismack Biyombo. Hezonja still got his burn and he made the most of it with 5-of-8 shooting, including a 4-of-5 mark from downtown. As a young player on a lousy team, Hezonja is at least on the fantasy radar with the trade deadline approaching.

             This was a bad game on both ends, and this comes after Malcolm Delaney started the second half for Prince on Monday. He's really cold and it's coming at the wrong time with Tyler Dorsey taking minutes from him and Marco Belinelli also seeing late run. The good news for Prince is the Hawks are ""open for business"" in trades according to ESPN, which means Prince would almost have to play more. If you think anyone in your league would add him, it's probably not a good idea to drop him. He is more of a stash right now.

             Clarkson also hit a pair of 3-pointers in 24 minutes tonight, but it wasn't nearly enough to avoid a blowout loss in Orlando. Lonzo Ball's absence with a knee injury has conveniently allowed L.A. to showcase Clarkson prior to the trade deadline, and fantasy owners should be rooting for him to land on a bad team.

             The Lakers were blown out which gave them even less incentive to play their 29-year-old center, who is on a one-year deal and will hit unrestricted free agency this summer. He hasn't played more than 24 minutes in a game since Nov. 17 and his minutes could evaporate entirely late in the season -- the Lakers are already 6.5 games out of the playoff picture. There should be more appealing options on the wire.

            Tyler Ennis tied his season-high with four rebounds on Wednesday, but he scored just five points without any other stats in 10 minutes of action.
        
        
             Ennis actually tied his season-high in boards just four minutes into the first quarter tonight. He played less than reserve guards Jordan Clarkson, Josh Hart and Alex Caruso, and his fantasy role could vaporize entirely whenever Lonzo Ball (knee) returns. Plan accordingly.

            Domantas Sabonis had 10 points, seven boards, two assists and two steals in 21 minutes off the bench on Wednesday.
        
        
             Sabonis is enjoying a mini-breakout with the Pacers this season, averaging career-high scoring (12.6 points), rebounds (8.4) and assists (2.1). The bad news in category-based leagues is that he's shooting 72.5% from the FT line on 3.3 attempts, with a meager 0.5 steals and 0.5 blocks. He's a late-round big man in roto, but closer to the top-100 in most points formats.

            Lance Stephenson (thigh) had 13 points on 5-of-8 shooting, three rebounds, two assists and two 3-pointers in 15 minutes during Wednesday's home win.
        
        
             Stephenson played through a sore right thigh and it shouldn't cost him any time. He's yet to miss a game all season, but remains better-suited to points leagues -- poor percentages and a lack of defensive stats ruin his appeal in category-based formats. It shouldn't affect fantasy values, but the Pacers will be coached by assistant Dan Burke in Charlotte on Friday, since Nate McMillan will be away for personal reasons.

            The Suns have bought out Greg Monroe.
        
        
             The Suns couldn't get anything in a trade on Monroe, so he'll hit the free agent market. Several teams will be after him and he should clear waivers. Chances are this will hurt his fantasy value unless a team like New Orleans adds him  - the Pelicans are hard capped, so it won't be easy. This also confirms that Alex Len is not healthy for the Suns to hold him out. Maybe we see Alan Williams in the next couple weeks. Monroe's owners can probably drop him.

            Marcus Morris (bruised hip) was helped off the court in the third quarter on Wednesday, and he will not return.
        
        
             He had a brutal fall on his left hip and needed help to the locker room. Michael Beasley caught his head and caused Morris to get horizontal on the way down. He may also be getting checked for a concussion from this fall. If he's forced to miss any games, Jayson Tatum and Semi Ojeleye could get a few more minutes.

             The Pacers went 3-0 during their homestand and fantasy owners were relieved to see Bojan knock down some shots after a scoreless dud vs. Charlotte on Monday. He's not very well-rounded, statistically, but continues to carve out low-end value as a perimeter specialist.

             Turner logged 33 minutes and his starting job led to Domantas Sabonis coming off the bench. The Pacers are trying to get Turner more involved on post-ups and they went to him a lot early tonight, which is a positive sign for his role going forward. Injuries have sapped him of any momentum this season, but tonight's game is a reminder of his early-round upside.

             Oladipo shot 5-of-12 from the field and 2-of-2 from the line, and it obviously wasn't his finest hour in a Pacers uniform. Indiana held on for the win, though, bumping them ahead of the Bucks into the No. 6 seed. With playoff positioning at stake, Oladipo's rest-of-season value should be unassailable.

We're already seeing results -- Brooks has had a usage rate above 20% seven times this season, five of which have come in the Grizzlies' past nine games. He's a solid stash while we wait for the chips to fall in Memphis.

His value is likely to drop in a big way.

             This is one of the more surprising stories of the day with Booker having a tender ribcage. Coach Jay Triano hasn't committed to to where Booker will start, and he has said he's more concerned about the defense of that first unit. Either way, go ahead and get him back in your lineup while Tyler Ulis and Isaiah Canaan take a hit.

Darell Arthur got the start in his place on Tuesday and finished with 10 points, three boards, one 3-pointer, two assists, one steal, one block and one turnover in 19 minutes, so he'll be on the deep league radar if he can stick as a starter on Thursday.

             The Pelicans haven't yet released a firm timetable on Boogie, but generally speaking, these sort of injuries take 6-10 months to recover from so in a worst-case scenario he might not be ready for the start of the 2018-19 season. Unfortunately, Achilles injuries can be career altering ordeals, and Cousins' size could complicate the issue. He'll be a risky guy to draft next season.

             He was rolling as the backup heading into this game, but now he'll be held out. In Chalmers' last DNP, it was Wayne Selden who went off with a career-high 31 points while Ben McLemore got 10 in a start. Kobi Simmons could also be asked to fill in.

However, the Grizzlies have almost no chance at the playoffs and Green is battling injuries this year. Jarell Martin is worth a look in DFS and as an add in 12-team leagues.

McLemore will be returning from a two-game absence, and he could get into the rotation tonight with Memphis so banged up. Brooks is the preferred target between the two, though.

Bobby Portis needs to be owned in all leagues.RotoGrinders.com Daily Slant: Portis leads the Bulls with a 1.02 FPPM mark with Mirotic, Dunn and all inactive/non-rotation members off the floor. He should see ample run off the bench, but beware that Paul Zipser has been named the starter in place of Markkanen, which could lead to more offensive responsibility being placed on the wings (Holiday, LaVine, Grant) while the starting five is out there.

In Speights previous start this season, he only managed to put up 7.0 points, two 3-pointers, one rebound, one turnover and nothing else in 18 minutes, so he's still not a great target tonight.

             Well, this is an interesting move with Speights getting a start. Gordon's hip injury didn't look bad this weekend, but now he'll miss his second straight game. He should be considered questionable for Saturday against the Wizards. Mario Hezonja and Speights are risky plays while Khem Birch should get the backup center minutes.RotoGrinders.com Daily Slant: Speights actually leads the Magic in usage rate with Gordon and all other inactive/non-rotation members off the floor. He holds a healthy 30.2% usage with a 0.96 FPPM mark, and if he's able to come close to matching those totals in a spot-start, he should have a nice shot at exceeding value. Mario Hezonja should still see ample run off the bench.

Griffin has held his high usage rate in almost any situation, so his fantasy owners shouldn't expect a drop off once he figures out the offense.

             The team downplayed the injury on Saturday, but now he'll be missing his third game in a row. Of course, the Nets are one of the most cautious teams in the NBA, so this is expected. His owners can consider dropping him. D'Angelo Russell is surprisingly called probable for this game, but there still has to be a good chance he doesn't suit up. If that's the case, we should see some Nik Stauskas revenge at the point.

The bigger story on Bledsoe today is that he was limited in practice, so chances are that update is more recent than this one because it takes a lot of time for teams to write game notes. For now, expect Bledsoe to be a game-time call for Thursday. We'll get an update at Thursday shootaround.

             Bledsoe reportedly could have returned to the game on Monday if needed, but the Bucks wanted to be cautious with him. The ankle issue doesn't sound very serious, but maybe they give him one more day off to ensure he's completely past the issue. If Bledsoe sits on Thursday, Matthew Dellavedova would likely get the start, although that doesn't mean much in fantasy hoops.

             Even if he's cleared to play, there are no guarantees he'll get out there. Yabusele belongs on the waiver wire in all leagues.

             Larkin's playing status is typically irrelevant, but if he's forced to join Kyrie Irving (quad) and Marcus Smart (hand) on the sidelines tonight, that could result in major minutes for Terry Rozier. Check back closer to tip-off for official confirmation on Larkin's status.

             With Marcus Smart (hand) also unavailable, Terry Rozier could be in line for a start today, making him an intriguing DFS target with a favorable matchup against New York. Al Horford, Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum will also see an uptick in usage with Uncle Drew watching from the sidelines. The Celtics take on the 15-35 Hawks on Friday, so this could end up turning into a two-game absence for Irving.

""Im going to have a lot of scoring days because I work so hard, but it just shows the sacrifice the point guards have for the team."" While Murray failed to get a bucket, he still came through with 13 boards, seven dimes and two swats over 26 minutes. We doubt he'll hit doughnuts in the scoring department again this season, but his value is derived from his rebounding and defensive stats anyway.

             The Grizzlies want a first-round pick for Evans and the 76ers are reportedly reluctant to throw that into the deal, although Memphis may be able to entice them if they'd be willing to take on Jerryd Bayless, who is owed roughly $8.5 million next season. Evans has also been linked to Boston, New Orleans, Miami, OKC and Houston, and it seems likely that he won't finish the year in Memphis. He's in an ideal situation in Memphis, so owners may want to sell-high before he gets dealt.

Whiteside has been rumored to be available, so it'll interesting to see if this report gains any traction. Jabari Parker would likely need to be included to entice Miami to pull the trigger, and a Whiteside departure would open up minutes for guys like Kelly Olynyk and Bam Adebayo.

            Cody Zeller (knee) has been ramping up his activities at recent practices.
        
        
             ""It feels good so far. I did a little bit of 3-on-3 in Indianapolis a couple of days ago, and I did it again [Tuesday],"" Zeller said. ""The last week or so Ive been able to crank up the workouts a little bit. A lot of running on the court [but] theres really nothing to compare to playing in an NBA game [with the] pounding."" Zeller still hasn't gone through 5-on-5 work, he probably won't be able to get out there for Friday's game against the Pacers, but his return is right around the corner.

             ""Hes got a ways to go. Hell tell you that. Which is normal,"" Atkinson said. ""The guy was out for awhile and hes playing a tough position in this league. Guys are in him and I just think its going to take time. It is what it is."" Atkinson was also non-committal when asked if Russell would be available on Wednesday for the second game of this back-to-back set, so owners will want to confirm his status closer to tip-off.

            J.J. Barea (left oblique strain) is questionable to play Wednesday vs. the Suns.
        
        
             Barea has spent the past two games on the sidelines with the oblique strain, which has resulted in more minutes for Dennis Smith Jr., Yogi Ferrell and Devin Harris. It'll be more of the same if he can't give it a go tonight, with DSJ offering the most upside out of the group.

             ""Im trying to help the team win and be productive. The coaches have shown me what they expect of me and Im trying to implement that,"" Okafor said. ""Its very encouraging. Im doing the right thing every day and doing whats asked of me. Hopefully, I can stay on the same trajectory."" Okafor has earned minutes in the mid-20s over the past two games to go with averages of 13.0 points, 9.5 boards and 1.0 block per game, so he's starting to move in the right direction.

             ""[Allens] been playing well. [Starting] is the next step for him. I thought it was going to happen later, probably All-Star break,"" Atkinson said. ""Hes clamoring for more minutes... Its been difficult playing three guys. I dont think anybodys happy with their minutes when youre just getting little chunks."" Tyler Zeller picked up a DNP-CD on Tuesday with Allen getting his first career start and Jahlil Okafor earning all the backup minutes, and that's a trend that will likely continue. Allen offers a ton of upside in blocks, so he's someone to think about grabbing in deep leagues.

             He played 30 minutes, so he slid right back into his usual role. Turner has very little upside when the Blazers are healthy and he was averaging 11.5 points, 2.8 rebounds, 2.2 assists and 0.9 triples in January prior to Tuesday, so he's more of a deep-league asset.

             Nurkic was outplayed by Ed Davis in his previous two games and Davis is still a legitimate threat, so Nurkic needed a big night in the worst way. He only hit 7-of-17 shots and missed his only free throw, but this was his most active game in quite some time. He'll have a great chance to build some momentum with a matchup vs. the Bulls on Wednesday -- Chicago has allowed the seventh most fantasy points to centers this season.

Jordan finished 3-of-6 from the field and 2-of-4 from the line and continues to produce despite all the rumors about his future in Los Angeles -- Jordan and the Clippers are far apart in contract negotiations and they are reportedly looking to move him and Lou Williams at the deadline in exchange for picks and young talent.

             Williams struggled with his shot tonight, but the All-Star snub has been a top-12 player in 9-category leagues for the past month. The Clippers just moved Blake Griffin on Monday and ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski is reporting that Williams and DeAndre Jordan could follow him out the door in exchange for young talent and draft picks, and it's hard to imagine a trade not hurting his value. His fantasy owners should be hoping for a quiet trade deadline.

Gallo didn't show much rust tonight, and with a couple days off before Saturday's game, it's possible he could flirt with 30 minutes in that one. He's worth picking back up or activating off your I.R. spot, but it remains to be seen if he can actually stay on the floor.

             The Clippers didn't have Tobias Harris or Boban Marjanovic tonight, but Harrell is a name to keep an eye on since Blake Griffin is no longer around. Harrell can play both the four and five, so he would also benefit from a potential DeAndre Jordan trade. Foul trouble limited him to 17 minutes tonight and the Clippers only play one more time this week, but at least add him to your watch list.

             Wow. This was his second highest scoring game of the season (he scored 30 on Nov. 1) and 11 assists tied his season high. Rubio has been a mess for most of the season, but this also happened last year, when he got crazy hot over the last few months of the season. It could be happening again, as he's now averaging 12.4 points, 6.2 rebounds, 6.8 assists, 1.2 steals and 1.2 3-pointers on 41 percent shooting over his last five games. And that's a heck of a lot better than when he averaged just 9.2 points in December, and 2.9 rebounds and 4.0 assists in November.

            Rudy Gobert hit 4-of-7 shots for nine points, six rebounds, one assist, three steals and a block in 28 minutes of Tuesday's blowout win over the Warriors.
        
        
             The Jazz are leading the league in defense since Gobert returned six games ago with a 103.4 rating. Gobert wasn't great tonight, but he's been pretty darn good since returning to action on Jan. 19 and the Jazz have won three straight and four of their last five. Tonight's game was a surprising blowout and they didn't need to run Gobert out there in garbage time, so look for him to get hot again on Friday against the Suns.

             You could argue that Thompson and JaVale McGee were the only Warriors who showed up tonight. Thompson hit 12-of-17 shots in 31 minutes, adding six rebounds, three assists, two steals and three triples. He's been all over the place lately, but he's still been a top-30 player in 9-category leagues on the season.

             Kevon Looney (illness) was out and Jordan Bell (ankle) is still on the shelf, so McGee was the backup center tonight. He played 16 minutes and made the most of them with four rebounds and a pair of blocks. The Warriors are off for a couple days and Looney should be back on Friday vs. the Kings, so McGee isn't a good pickup.

             He missed his season high in scoring by one point, and that came five games ago when he had 21 against the Clippers on Jan. 20. Ingles was a tough pill to swallow for a stretch of the season, but is rolling right now, averaging 14.6 points, 2.4 rebounds, 3.2 assists, 1.8 steals and 3.6 3-pointers on 56 percent shooting over his last five games. He's benefitting from the absence of Rodney Hood (leg), but is still worth a pickup while he's this hot.

             Curry hit just 4-of-13 shots, but he wasn't the only Warrior who struggled -- Kevin Durant had 17 points on 5-of-13 shooting and called this his worst game of the season, while Draymond hit 3-of-11 shots for eight points. Curry's shoulder issue is very minor and he was coming off a 49-point outing, so we'll chalk this up as an off night. Expect him to bounce back vs. the Kings on Friday.

             He had scored in double figures in four straight games, so we're not too worried about the lack of scoring, and he had a 14-rebound game in December, so the only season high he got tonight was tying one with the seven dimes. He's averaging 10.8 points, 9.2 rebounds, 5.6 assists, 1.6 steals and 0.6 blocks on 49 percent shooting over his last five games. He's hit double digits in rebounding in three of his last five games and is a must-own player now that he's been given the keys to the Spurs' car.

            Luc Mbah a Moute started for Trevor Ariza (hamstring) on Tuesday and played 39 minutes, but finished with just eight points, two rebounds, one assist and one 3-pointer.
        
        
             Yuck. And now that Eric Gordon's hurt (back), the Rockets could be looking for another fill-in starter against the Spurs on Thursday, especially if Chris Paul (groin) is out again. P.J. Tucker played 36 minutes for nine points, three rebounds, one assist and three 3-pointers, while Gerald Green played 32 minutes for 11 points, six boards and two 3-pointers. One of them would likely start for Gordon on Thursday if he can't go, but given what James Harden did tonight (60-10-11 triple-double), there may not be much left to go around for his teammates. Green looks like the best streamer if Gordon, Ariza and Paul are going to continue to miss time.

             He scored 18 points in the fourth quarter and broke Calvin Murphy's franchise scoring record of 57 points, which he set in 1978. Murphy was also on hand to witness it and was shown cheering Harden's accomplishment. This was his third triple-double of the season and he could be primed to continue to go off for the rest of the week, as Chris Paul and Trevor Ariza were out for this one, and Eric Gordon left with back stiffness. Lastly, Harden played a season-high 46 minutes and 26 seconds, racked up his fourth 50-point game of the season, and set his own career high, which was previously 56 points. Big game, James!

             Additionally, D.J. Augustin hit 4-of-10 shots and three 3-pointers for 13 points, three rebounds and four assists in the 114-107 loss. Elfrid Payton was benched with Mack and DJA's ""hot hands"" given as the reason, so we'll have to see what happens on Wednesday night against the Lakers. Chances are Payton will be back out there and get his 30 or so minutes, meaning Mack and Augustin are simply guys to keep an eye on in case Payton lost a grip on his job tonight. James Harden's 60-point triple-double just might have done some damage to Payton's short-term future in Orlando, although it also may not have hurt him at all.

             Tolliver also scored 20 points in his last game, but that was also against Cleveland -- they have the worst defensive rating in the NBA. Tolliver made another start tonight and added four rebounds, four assists, one block, two steals and three 3-pointers, but the arrival of Blake Griffin could cripple his fantasy value. Continue to treat him like a deep-league 3-point specialist.

             This was probably Speights' best game of the season, although he scored 19 and 18 points in a couple games earlier in the season. He hadn't scored more than six points in his previous six games and simply saw a boost in minutes with Aaron Gordon out with a hip injury. Gordon's likely out again on Wednesday and Mario Hezonja should start, but Speights might be able to have another meaningful game. However, he's also very hard to trust given the way he's played for most of the season.

             After the game, coach Stan Van Gundy gushed about him and said it was the best he's seen him play. Johnson also tied his career-high with 10 rebounds, adding four assists, two steals, one block, one triple and four turnovers. It's worth noting that Cleveland has the worst defensive rating in the NBA and Blake Griffin wasn't available for his Pistons debut, but SVG did say that one of the reasons he liked the trade was because it opened up minutes for guys like Johnson. It's hard not to take a flier on him after a game like this.

             It sounds like Gordon isn't likely to play again on Wednesday and if he's out, Hezonja looks like a solid DFS option once again. As far as a long-term pickup, Gordon's injury would have to keep him out for an extended period of time for Hezonja to be worth it in most leagues.

             The good news is that he didn't have a turnover, but that's where it ends. There are no reports of an injury, but the fact he was guarding James Harden, who scored 60 and made history tonight, probably had a lot to do with it, while his backups also got ""hot hands."" Shelvin Mack came off the bench to hit 5-of-5 shots and two 3-pointers for 15 points, six rebounds and four assists, and D.J. Augustin hit 4-of-10 shots and three 3-pointers for 13 points, three rebounds and four assists in the loss. Assuming Payton's not hurt, it looks like he just got Harden-ed in this one and we'll have to see if there's any fallout on Wednesday. For now, look for him to resume his role of playing 30 minutes a night and starting at point guard going forward.

He looked like a must-own player shortly before the 17th, and he's still got a ton of potential with the Kings.

             This was Frye's third game of the season with double-digit points, but Love is expected to miss 6-8 weeks which puts him firmly on the radar. Jae Crowder started the second half, but didn't make much of an impact. Frye made 15 starts last season and put up 11.4 points, 5.1 rebounds, 0.8 blocks and 2.1 triples, so it's not a bad idea to take a flier on him in a 14- or 16-team league.

            Kosta Koufos hit 7-of-12 shots and 3-of-4 free throws for 17 points, 17 rebounds, two assists and two steals in 37 minutes of Tuesday's win over the Pelicans.
        
        
             If you rolled the dice on Koufos tonight, the move paid off as he set a career-high in rebounds and racked up a ton of DFS points. He also had six points and 12 boards on Sunday and has played in three straight games. However, he's a veteran and the Kings will still find ways to give him random DNPs, despite the fact Willie Caulie-Stein and Skal Labiessiere could miss several more games with their injuries. Pick him up if you're desperate, but we'd like to see the Kings announce that he's got the starting job until WCS is back before making the move.

            Dwyane Wade (personal, shoulder) returned from a two-game absence in Tuesday's 125-114 loss vs. Detroit, scoring 18 points with eight rebounds, five assists, one block and one triple.
        
        
             Wade played 28 minutes for the first time since Christmas, and while he did have fresh legs, it's fair to expect a larger workload from him with Kevin Love (hand) expected to miss 6-8 weeks. With a revenge game coming up against the Heat on Wednesday, it's not a bad idea to add Wade to see if this new workload sticks.

             With Willie Cauley-Stein and Skal Labissiere injured, the Kings plan of resting vets all the time may be temporarily thrown out the window. But before you get too excited about tonight's line, keep in mind that Z-Bo hadn't scored more than 12 points in a game since Jan. 11 and has been rested in three of his last eight games. The injuries to fellow Kings' big men may be keeping him afloat right now, but he's still not a very appealing player to pick up right now, with more DNPs likely coming his way soon.

             Clark hadn't scored more than nine points in his previous six games and he had to shoot lights out to get his 20 points tonight. He hasn't seen these kind of minutes recently either, and may have gotten a boost due to Dante Cunningham hurting his back. However, the reality is that he probably just got hot tonight. Just keep an eye on him.

             The Nets were embarrassed by Enes Kanter and Kristaps Porzingis and Okafor wasn't effective on offense, hitting just 2-of-7 shots. The good news is that Tyler Zeller was a DNP-CD, meaning the Nets may roll with a two-man center rotation going forward. If you need a big, keep Okafor and Jarrett Allen on your radar.

             Remember that time Rondo had 25 assists on Dec. 27 and then 15 assists on Jan. 8? Well, he's been pretty bad since then. He hasn't scored in double figures in 10 straight games, has compiled two or fewer rebounds in six of his last 10, and hasn't had more than three assists in four of his last 10 games. You've got to be in a pretty deep league to be sitting on Rondo as long as Jrue Holiday is healthy.

             Cunningham wasn't a must-own player, by any means, to begin with and Omer Asik played 24 minutes off the bench tonight, finishing with one point, four rebounds, a steal, a block and five fouls. Asik isn't a guy we're necessarily interested in picking up either, and Diallo played just six minutes. Darius Miller still looks like the pickup in the wake of DeMarcus Cousins' injury and he scored 10 points with two 3-pointers in 29 minutes tonight.

In his last five outings, Russell has more turnovers (15) than assists (8) and is shooting a combined 12-of-41 from the field. It makes a lot of sense to leave him on your bench until he heats up.

             He got off to a really rough start by allowing Kristaps Porzingis a couple quick 3-pointers, but did settle down as the game progressed. The Nets were absolutely killed on the glass and it's fair to put some of that blame on Allen, but he did show a nice touch on the offensive end and made all six of his shots. Tyler Zeller was a DNP-CD and Jahlil Okafor played 25 minutes, so it would be great news for Allen's outlook if they continue to play just two centers. Despite tonight's underwhelming line, he's worth a look as a stash if you're targeting rebounds, blocks and FG percentage.

             Davis was a monster tonight and this game just makes us sad that DeMarcus Cousins didn't get to play, as he would have tried to destroy his former team and help the Pelicans get to the playoffs.

With all the big men and NBA players in general dropping like flies right, Valanciunas suddenly looks like a guy you want to own going forward.

             X-rays were negative, so hopefully Baker is day-to-day. He's averaging 12.3 minutes in January, so there aren't many fantasy implications here. Maybe we'll see more two-PG lineups in his absence.

             The six triples set a new career-high, and it was just a matter of time with 16 career games with 4+ triples. He finished 9-of-19 from the field and hit all four free throws in 30 minutes, helping the Knicks win their second straight game. When asked about the upcoming trade deadline, Porzingis said he was in favor of adding a veteran piece to help the Knicks reach the postseason. ""Playoff experience for myself, individually, would be huge at this point in my career -- the sooner, the better."" A competitive Knicks team would be great for Porzingis' value down the stretch.

             Towns has scored 16 or fewer points in four of his last five games, but he's still racking up rebounds, steals, blocks and 3-pointers on most nights, still hasn't missed a game this season, and is still the No. 8 fantasy player in nine-cat leagues. Don't be frightened by the fact KAT was outplayed by Jonas Valanciunas tonight. He's actually played very well in four straight games, proving that miracles do happen.

             With John Wall out indefinitely, Porter, Bradley Beal, Markieff Morris and Tomas Satoransky are all going to have to step up, and they did just that tonight. Porter went to the locker room with a minor head injury for about five minutes, but it doesn't appear to be a big deal. He was great tonight.

Washington pulled away in the final minutes though, and the Thunder will try to regroup in time for Thursday's date with the Nuggets.

             Tomas Satoransky and Tim Frazier both did a nice job on Westy defensively tonight, and this wasn't his worst game of the season, as he's had several games that garnered fewer points and more missed shots than he had tonight. Westbrook had scored between 31 and 46 points in each of his last four games, so maybe he was just due for an off night. He'll bounce back against the Nuggets on Thursday. Carmelo Anthony wasn't much better, hitting just 7-of-21 shots on the night, as the Thunder saw their eight-game winning streak come to an end.

             ESPN's Brian Windhorst is reporting that this will be a 6-8 week recovery time for Love, so this is pretty devastating news. As if things weren't going bad enough for the Cavs and Love, they'll now be looking to guys like Jeff Green, Tristan Thompson, Channing Frye and Jae Crowder to step up in Love's absence. And what it really probably means is that the Cavs are going to be very busy this trade season trying to get a piece that will help fix their broken puzzle.

            Stanley Johnson is starting against the Cavaliers on Tuesday.
        
        
             He's been a disappointment for most of the season, but coach Stan Van Gundy did say that one of the reasons he liked the Blake Griffin trade was because it opened up minutes for Johnson, Luke Kennard and Reggie Bullock. Just keep an eye on him.

             Tolliver started in place of Avery Bradley (hamstring) on Sunday and finished with 20 points (on 6-of-12 shooting) three rebounds and five assists. Bradley was traded on Monday, and Blake Griffin has yet to arrive in Detroit, so Tolliver will draw another start on Tuesday.

             He was a true-game time call, but made it through warmups just fine. He's not 100 percent, but his season-long owners should activate him and hope for the best. In more good news, Drummond was named to the All-Star team in place of John Wall (knee).

             This will be Allen's first career start and he'll be joined by Spencer Dinwiddie, Allen Crabbe, DeMarre Carroll and Quincy Acy. Allen is loaded with upside, and it's telling that he'll get a crack at the starting five spot before Jahli Okafor does. Allen could carve out some standard league value if he could just get his minutes consistently in the 25-range, and starting is the first step to that happening. He's certainly worth a speculative add in deep leagues.

             Ferguson started on Sunday, but did a whole lot of nothing with just five boards over 23 scoreless minutes. Billy Donovan hasn't committed to a long-term starting two-man with Andre Roberson done for the year, so while Ferguson is starting now, he could be replaced by someone like Josh Huestis 
or Alex Abrines soon. None of these guys are expected to have fantasy value.

             This is a surprising scratch, as Miles had not been listed on the injury report. Miles is averaging 18.6 minutes per game off the bench this season. This could allow Norman Powell to get back in the rotation. OG Anunoby and Delon Wright will also likely see an uptick in playing time.

             Satoransky will get first dibs on the starting point guard position with Wall out for the next 6-8 weeks, so he's worth a look in deep leagues. In his previous start this season, Satoransky produced 11 points, seven assists and three rebounds. Tim Frazier will also have the opportunity for extended minutes, but he's been really inconsistent this year, so he's more of a wait-and-see guy.

With Aaron Gordon (hip) out, Fournier should have plenty of shots coming his way. He'll be joined in the starting unit by Elfrid Payton, Mario Hezonja, Jonathon Simmons and Bismack Biyombo.

He's a solid DFS value play on Tuesday night.

            Chris Paul (sore right groin) will not suit up for Tuesday's game against the Magic.
        
        
             It's not all that surprising to see the Rockets' play it safe with a matchup against the 14-34 Magic, as holding CP3 out today will give him a full three days off ahead of Friday's game in San Antonio. Eric Gordon will slide back into the starting five with James Harden shifting over to the point, and with both Paul and Trevor Ariza (hamstring) unavailable, Harden's usage rate could go into the ridiculous range.

We should get another update following Wednesday morning's shootaround, but if Brooks is out, that would open up minutes for guys like Jarell Martin, Wayne Selden and Kobi Simmons.

             It's unclear exactly when Chalmers suffered the hamstring injury, but with Memphis playing for Ping Pong balls at this point, there's little incentive for their guys to play hurt. If both Chalmers and Brooks sit tomorrow, Tyreke Evans could be forced into heavy minutes, and he'd certainly be on the DFS radar. Stay tuned.

            Lonzo Ball (left knee) will not play Wednesday against the Magic.
        
        
             Ball has been making progress as his works his way back from an MCL sprain, yet the Lakers are taking a cautious approach to his return. Ball did not practice with the team on Tuesday, but has started testing his knee laterally with the trainers. He'll need to get in a full practice before he is cleared for game action. Jordan Clarkson will continue to see extended minutes in Ball's absence.

            The trade that would have sent George Hill to Cleveland was held up because the Cavs wanted Hill to agree to a buyout if LeBron James left as a free agent next summer.
        
        
             ""George Hill, they didnt want to buy him out this year,"" said Brian Windhorst of ESPN. ""What they wanted to do was protect themselves in the event that, if LeBron James left, whether George Hill would be willing to take a buyout on the $20 million hes owed on his contract after this season."" Essentially the Cavs asked Hill to sacrifice $20 million in guaranteed money if LBJ opted to leave, and Hill wasn't feeling that. Anything could happen, but at this point, a trade seems unlikely.

            Stan Van Gundy acknowledged Blake Griffin's injury history on Tuesday but said that bringing in a five-time All-Star was worth the risk for a franchise that has struggled to bring in top-tier talent.
        
        
             ""Our thinking was this: The hardest thing to do in this league is to get a proven star,"" Van Gundy said. ""The guy's a five-time All-Star. He's been an All-NBA guy, [one of] top 15 guys in the league. He's only 28 years old. We know the injury history -- that's the risk on it. But that risk was worth it because of the talent we're bringing back."" While Griffin will not play on Tuesday, there's a good chance he'll be able to make his Pistons' debut on Thursday against the Grizzlies.

             Zeller has been cleared for contact, so he's very close to getting back out there. Maybe he'll be able to return to the court for Friday's game against the Pacers, but he'll be brought along slowly and with averages of just 7.5 points, 5.5 boards and 1.1 blocks per game on the year, there's no incentive to stash him.

             Mirotic was nearly traded to the Pelicans on Tuesday, but the deal fell through with New Orleans reportedly hesitant to pick up his player option worth $12.5 million for the 2018-19 season, as they want to ensure they have the cap space to sign DeMarcus Cousins this summer. While Mirotic will be traveling, he is also dealing with a lower left leg strain, so it's still unclear if he'll be able to take the court on Wednesday in Portland. Expect to get another update following shootaround.

             It's unclear if Dunn will be able to rejoin that team at any point during their upcoming three-game road trip, but with Chicago sitting on an 18-32 record and their eyes towards the 2018 draft, there's no incentive to rush along Dunn in the recovery process. The Bulls have provided vague updates, saying he's improving, and then following that up with saying he could still miss ""extended time."" It's a murky situation, but Jerian Grant will continue to start in Dunn's absence with Denzel Valentine seeing extended run with the second unit.

             Gallinari hasn't played since December 9, so expect there to be plenty of rust and minutes restrictions on him in his return to action tonight. It'll probably be at least a few weeks until he really starts going, but with Blake Griffin no longer a part of the equation in Los Angeles, Gallinari should easily establish himself as the No. 1 or 2 option in the offense. He has top-30 potential and needs to be owned in all leagues. Tyron Wallace's days of relevancy in 12-team leagues could be numbered.

Bojan Bogdanovic and Cory Joseph would likely split the majority of Born Ready's minutes if he's out on Wednesday, with Bogdanovic offering a bit more upside. Check back for another update following Wednesday morning's shootaround.

            Updating a previous item, Adrian Wojnarowski? of ESPN is reporting that New Orleans and Chicago had a deal in place for Nikola Mirotic, but it's fallen apart for now.
        
        
             Wojnarowski? explains that the hold up is the $12.5 million team option on Mirotic's contract for the 2018-19 season. Per Woj: ""Essentially, Mirotic has control over his future with a trade. He can't be sure that New Orleans will pick up his $12.5M option next season -- unless Chicago does it for him prior to completing the trade. It is understandable why Mirotic isn't eager to cost himself that $12.5M."" Stay tuned, as Mirotic's future remains murky.

            Nikola Mirotic will reportedly be traded to the New Orleans Pelicans in exchange for Omer Asik and a first-round draft pick, according to Vincent Goodwill of NBC Sports Chicago.
        
        
             We're still waiting to get confirmation from additional sources. The Pelicans would obviously like to upgrade their frontcourt following the loss of DeMarcus Cousins. However, sacrificing a first-round pick for Mirotic would be a steep price to pay. If the trade does go through, it will increase the fantasy value of Mirotic, who would likely join the starting lineup in New Orleans. It would also boost the value of Lauri Markkanen and Bobby Portis in Chicago, as it would clear out the logjam in the Bulls frontcourt.

             Gordon logged 40 minutes in Saturday's loss to the Pacers, but was unable to practice on Monday due to the hip injury, and he'll likely miss Wednesday's game against the Lakers as well. Mario Hezonja is expected to replace Gordon in the starting lineup Tuesday night. Hezonja has started nine games for Orlando this season and is averaging 14.2 points, 5.3 rebounds and 1.8 assists in 30.7 minutes over those nine starts. He's worth considering as a DFS option on Tuesday.

The Bulls fly to Portland on Tuesday night, so we may know whether or not he gets on the plane.

            John Wall will undergo a ""clean up"" procedure on his left knee on Wednesday and will be sidelined for 6-8 weeks.
        
        
             Wall did not play Sunday after it was revealed that he was dealing with a recurrence of soreness and swelling in his left knee. Wall flew to Cleveland on Monday to get a second opinion from the doctor who performed his original knee surgery in 2016. A decision has now been made to have the knee scoped. The first report from The Washington Post indicated that Wall would miss six weeks. However, Woj tweeted out that Wall could be sidelined for two months. Tomas Satoransky and Tim Frazier will divvy up minutes at point guard in Wall's absence.

             Paul played just 27 minutes vs. the Suns on Sunday, but left the game in the fourth quarter due to the groin issue. CP3 says he was ""fine,"" but D'Antoni wants to err on the side of caution. ""I just want to make sure it is 100 percent,"" D'Antoni said on Monday. ""We just want to be careful with it. But it's nothing alarming. If it stays sore, we'll figure it out tomorrow and go to the next day. But we'll make sure there's no soreness whatsoever before he plays. Hopefully, it's tomorrow, but we don't know that.""

             Bledsoe, who has been dealing with a left ankle issue since the Suns game last week, started on Monday vs. the Sixers, but played less than three minutes before exiting and never returned to the game. ""That was the plan, to go in and see how I feel,"" Bledsoe said. ""Unfortunately it didnt work out the way I planned."" The Bucks don't play again until Thursday, but we'll consider him questionable for that contest. We should have an update after Tuesday's practice.

             Chandler did not play in Monday's loss to the Celtics, but appears on track to return to the lineup Tuesday night. Will Barton logged a whopping 44 minutes on Monday. He'll see his minutes reduced to a more manageable number on Tuesday.

             The Pistons acquired Griffin, Johnson and Reed in a blockbuster deal that was completed Monday night. However, it appears we will have to wait until Thursday night, when the Pistons host the Grizzlies, or even possibly Saturday, to witness their Detroit debuts. We should have confirmation of their status shortly.

             Not good. He was using crutches in the locker room and isn't traveling with the team. Plumlee will have an MRI on Tuesday morning, but we may not get an update until coach Malone speaks prior to Tuesday's game. If you're in a standard league and need production now, Plumlee can be dropped despite his strong recent play. He'll lose a lot of value when Paul Millsap (wrist) returns anyways. Trey Lyles had 20 points and four triples vs. the Celtics and will likely be the big winner in the short term.

             Coach Mike Malone clearly isn't afraid to play Barton big minutes -- he's played 39+ minutes in three straight games and this was his eighth such game of the season. Barton stepped up in Wilson Chandler's absence and helped the Nuggets climb back from a 20-point deficit, hitting 8-of-18 shots and 1-of-1 from the line. Expect another heavy workload vs. the Spurs on Tuesday, with or without Chandler.

             Irving is feeling it, scoring at least 33 points in three of his last four games coming in, and was brilliant again tonight. He's on fire right now, shooting 59 percent from the floor over his last five games, and he's been the 13th best fantasy player in nine-cat leagues on the season.

             Nice. With Marcus Smart out for a couple weeks with a hand laceration, Rozier should get plenty of burn. There were concerns about his ankle, but he looked great tonight and the Celtics still have three games remaining this week. If he's available in your league, he looks like a quality streaming option right now. Go get him.

             The Nuggets nearly pulled off a crazy comeback and rallied back from 20 points down, but coach Mike Malone made a terrible decision to not use a timeout on Denver's final play.  ""I stand by the decision,"" Malone said after the game. As for Jokic, he was terrific and hit 8-of-17 shots and 6-of-7 free throws, and with Mason Plumlee picking up a calf injury, Jokic may play more at his natural position on Tuesday vs. the Spurs.

             Tatum has been all over the board lately, scoring in single digits in three of his previous four games prior to tonight, and this was his first 20-point game since way back on Christmas Day. Tatum's been a fifth-round fantasy value on the season, but has been returning just 14th-round value over the last month. Hopefully tonight was a sign that he's getting things turned around.

             Whiteside scored just six and eight points in each of his previous two games, but had a heart-to-heart talk with coach Erik Spoelstra recently that appeared to help. Additionally, the Mavericks are constantly torched by opposing centers and Whiteside went to work on them in the first quarter and never looked back. He's been a bit inconsistent this season, but with trade rumors quieting down and a positive meeting with his coach under his belt, Whiteside could be getting ready to roll.

             Lyles helped the Nuggets rally back from a 20-point deficit, but ultimately fell by one point after Will Barton missed a potential game-winning triple from way downtown. Lyles added seven rebounds, three assists, one block and four triples in 27 minutes, and he could be looking at a nice bump in value if Mason Plumlee (calf) misses time -- Plumlee had to be helped off the floor and couldn't return. Lyles is worth holding onto, at least until Paul Millsap (wrist) comes back.

He's returning fourth-round fantasy value over the past month and with all the minutes he's getting, he's going to stay right there, if not improve.

            Yogi Ferrell hit just 2-of-9 shots for six points, two rebounds and three assists in 33 minutes of Monday's 95-88 loss to the Heat.
        
        
             Ferrell has been hit-or-miss over his last four games, shooting 2-of-9 in two of them, but the minutes were encouraging, especially with Devin Harris back from a five-game absence. Ferrell's not completely reliable right now, obviously, but enough positive signs are there for owners to give him another chance, especially with J.J. Barea out with an oblique injury. The Mavericks have two more games left this week, so he has plenty of time to right the ship.

             He missed his previous five games with a concussion and a personal matter, but doesn't have fantasy value when he's fully healthy.

            Mason Plumlee suffered a right calf strain on Monday vs. the Celtics and will not return.
        
        
             He checked out with 7:38 left in the fourth quarter and had to be helped off the floor, but the Nuggets waited a good bit before ruling him out. Plumlee finished with 16 points, eight rebounds and two blocks in 28 minutes and has been playing really well for about two weeks, but if he misses time he'll be a tough player to hold since he'll lose a lot of value when Paul Millsap (wrist) returns. In the short term, Trey Lyles should benefit if Plumlee misses time and Kenneth Faried may get a chance to showcase himself for a trade. We won't have to wait long for an update with Denver playing the Spurs Tuesday.

            Isaiah Canaan struggled as a starter on Monday vs. the Grizzlies, scoring four points on 1-of-5 shots with three rebounds, three assists and two turnovers in 17 minutes.
        
        
             This was a wasted opportunity for Canaan with Devin Booker (ribs) sitting this one out. To make matters worse, Tyler Ulis clearly outplayed him tonight with 13 points, seven assists and five steals in 31 minutes. Booker could be back on Wednesday vs. Dallas, so Canaan is only worth monitoring in deeper leagues for now.

             This was just his third double-double of the season and he had plenty of things go wrong on the night, including the shooting and turnovers, but he's also scored in double figures in 15 straight games and came in shooting 42 percent in January. He's not exactly a fantasy beast, but has been playing much better since Christmas, making him start-worthy in any format.

             Devin Booker (ribs) sat this one out, but X-rays on his ribs came back negative and he could be back on Wednesday. Troy Daniels hasn't played well in the first unit and Isaiah Canaan was terrible tonight, hitting 1-of-5 shots in 17 minutes. As for Ulis, he was 6-of-13 from the field in 31 minutes. This was his first solid game in a while, so we'll need to see a lineup change or a few good games in a row before recommending him as an add in deeper formats.

He'll need to see minutes closer to 30 instead of 15 to have fantasy value and tonight has to be looked at as a step backwards. Just keep an eye on him.

             Len was a +5 compared to a -16 for Greg Monroe, while Tyson Chandler was rested on the second night of a back-to-back set.

             Bledsoe should be considered day-to-day and Snell could start on Thursday if he misses that contest. Bledsoe lasted just three minutes tonight, but might be ready to go on Thursday with three full days to recover. Snell's not worth owning in most leagues and is inconsistent, but that could change if one of his teammates suffers an injury that keeps them out for multiple games.

             Brogdon had missed three of his previous four games due to injury and looked a little rusty tonight, as teammates Giannis Antetokounmpo and Khris Middleton both went off in the win. Eric Bledsoe lasted just three minutes tonight with a left ankle injury and if he's going to miss anymore time, it should mean good things for Brogdon. Brogdon's been playing well all season and should be owned in all leagues, returning solid seventh-round value on the year.

Monroe has now played in five straight games with averages of 12.8 points, 8.4 rebounds, 2.2 assists and 1.2 steals, but it's going to be interesting to see what the Suns do when they have all three centers available on Wednesday vs. the Mavericks (Alex Len returned from a three-game absence tonight and played 25 minutes). The trade deadline is just around the corner, so it's not a bad idea to stash Monroe even if he's the odd man out for the next week.

He's a little too volatile for owners in category leagues right now, but keep an eye on him down the stretch as a potential stash.

            Eric Bledsoe started on Monday after being listed as probable with a sprained left ankle, but didn't look right and lasted just three minutes before being shutdown for the rest of the night.
        
        
             The Bucks said after the game that Bledsoe's ankle didn't allow him to continue to so we're putting him on the injury report. This was a tough break for his fantasy owners and Bledsoe is now questionable for Thursday's game at Minnesota. Tony Snell started in place of Bledsoe to start the second half and had 11 points in 31 minutes.

             He got a small bump with Devin Booker (ribs) out (his usage rate goes from 24.1 to 28.9 with Booker off the floor), but it sounds like Phoenix's star guard could be back on Wednesday vs. Dallas. Warren added seven rebounds, one assist and one steal in what was his seventh game with 20+ points out of his last eight. He's been on fire in January and has been a top-50 player in standard 9-category leagues over the past month.

             In his three games without Jason Kidd as his coach, Giannis is averaging 33 points, 13.3 rebounds, 7.0 assists, 1.0 steals, 1.3 blocks and 1.3 3-pointers on 57 percent shooting. The 10-of-10 free throws were especially nice to see after he hit just 5-of-10 on Sunday, and it looks like he's going to be a different kind of monster the rest of the way for the Bucks. And the scary thing is that none of his stats tonight were even season highs.

             He saw a bigger workload with Joel Embiid resting and came through with a nice game, despite the problems from downtown. He's been rolling all season and has scored in double figures in every games he's played since Nov. 27. Saric came in as a late sixth-round fantasy player and is a must-start player as long as he's healthy, obviously.

             He was 0-of-2 from the field and looked like a player with zero confidence -- he was passing up open shots and wasn't aggressive at all. He added two rebounds, one assist and one steal with Marquese Chriss (ankle) on the shelf, and he was outplayed by Jared Dudley. Bender has been terrible for weeks and has a combined 21 points in his last eight games. Leave him on the wire.

             Selden also dished out a career-high six assists with two rebounds and three triples in 31 minutes. His production has been all over the place and he scored a combined 15 points in his previous three games, so he'll need to string a few good games together before standard-league owners should look his way. If Tyreke Evans is traded, that would increase Selden's fantasy appeal.

However, Embiid is expected to play in back-to-back games on Friday and Saturday for the first time in his career, so the chances of Holmes (or Johnson) doing much in those games are slim.

Martin is putting up 12.3 points, 5.5 rebounds, 1.8 assists, 1.0 blocks and 1.0 steals in 31.0 minutes over his last four games and has stepped up for a depleted Grizzlies team, but JaMychal Green's (ankle) expected return this week could complicate things. He's still a solid hold in 14- of 16-team leagues.

             He didn't have a block and the Hawks still haven't really turned him loose with heavy minutes, but it still feels like it's coming. Taurean Prince was benched to start the second half and Malcolm Delaney started in his place, but if Prince is in, or lands in, the doghouse, Collins could see a bump in minutes. Eventually you have to think the Hawks will turn to Collins over Ersan Ilyasova (10 points, 2 steals, 2 blocks) as a starter, but it has yet to happen.

             Baze had a tremendous chase-down block on Jeff Teague in the first half that changed the momentum of the game and contributed in a big way as the Hawks got their 15th win. He was awful in Saturday's loss to the Wizards when he hit 1-of-9 shots in 18 minutes, but played well on Friday with 26 points and another full stat line. He'll look to keep it going on Wednesday night against Nicolas Batum and the Hornets.

             He didn't shoot it well, was 0-for-2 from downtown and the turnovers were painful, but he easily outplayed Jeff Teague in this one and helped his team get a win. His shot is broken right now, as he's hit just 13-of-41 shots over his last three games and is 1-of-10 from beyond the arc over that stretch. He'll look to get back on track against the Hornets on Wednesday, but the good news is that he had his fifth double-double of the season tonight.

             Delaney has been making some noise and is worth keeping an eye on, and might be worth picking up if he becomes a starter. He's averaging 6.0 points, 1.8 rebounds, 5.6 assists, 0.8 steals and 1.0 3-pointers on 38 percent shooting over his last five games, but Prince probably hasn't lost his starting gig yet. He was just struggling tonight, hitting 1-of-10 shots for three points, four rebounds and an assist in 25 minutes, but played well in his previous two games. Keep an eye on this position battle going forward.

             He checked out with about two minutes to go in the fourth quarter in obvious pain -- the Grizzlies had to foul to get him out of the game. He didn't go to the locker room, but he was probably just waiting for the game to end. Hopefully it's nothing serious and Evans was going off before the injury with 27 points (11-of-17 FGs, 2-of-2 FTs), four assists, one rebound, one steal and three triples in 26 minutes. For what it's worth, Evans was in good spirits after the game and didn't mention the injury in his post-game interview. If we do hear bad news, expect Andrew Harrison, Mario Chalmers and Wayne Selden to get a bump.

             Butler's been back for two games after a four-game absence with a knee injury and is averaging 35.5 minutes, 22.5 points, 6.5 rebounds, 4.0 assists, 1.5 steals, 1.0 blocks and 1.0 3-pointers in those two games. Hopefully he's good to go for Tuesday night at Toronto.

             Teague threw a horrible, long pass that was intercepted with the Hawks holding a one-point lead late, and then failed to get the ball inbounded after a timeout, resulting in another turnover that allowed the Hawks to put the game away. Teague just doesn't look right right now, going 1-of-16 for four points over his last two games, but he was playing well before that. He's dealing with an ankle injury and the Timberwolves play again on Tuesday night at Toronto, so owners should double check to make sure he's playing tomorrow night.

             MCW has no fantasy value this season, mostly because he just isn't very good regardless of how much he plays. But the Hornets are a deeper team when MCW's available.

             This was the second game this season Batum has fired up 17 shots and, ironically, he hit five 3-pointers in the other one on Dec. 16, as well. Batum has been really disappointing this season, but has shown signs of turning things around, scoring in double figures in seven of his last nine games. The buy-low window is still wide open on Batum, but if he gets hot, it will close quickly.

            Malcolm Delaney started the second half of Monday's game vs. the Wolves in place of Taurean Prince.
        
        
             It sounds like this is a coach's decision. Coach Budenholzer recently called Prince out and said he had to play ""smarter,"" so he has a shorter leash these days. Despite some rocky play recently, Prince is a hold with Atlanta expected to speed up the tank soon.

            Tyson Chandler (rest) will not suit up for Monday's game in Memphis.
        
        
             It's the second night of a back-to-back, and Chandler doesn't play in those, so he'll be rested tonight. Marquese Chriss (ankle) is unlikely to play, so guys like Dragan Bender and Greg Monroe could be forced into heavy minutes tonight, with Monroe offering a bit more upside.

With Booker out, Tyler Ulis, Isaiah Canaan and Troy Daniels should all be busy in the backcourt, but Triano won't reveal who is starting just yet.

This is a wait-and-see situation in most leagues.

             It looks like we will get a freed Boban, and it's also possible the Clippers unload DeAndre Jordan to open up even more minutes. Marjanovic's upside is too high to leave on the waiver wire in standard leagues because he only needs 20 minutes to flirt with top-75 value. It should be a treat to see him play with fellow Serbian Milos Teodosic, as well.

             He's still nursing a groin issue and a sore right hamstring, but Bradley should be eager for a fresh start in Los Angeles. Acquiring Bradley was a low-risk move by the Clippers, as they will get a few months to evaluate him before he becomes a free agent this summer. His primary competition will be Lou Williams, Austin Rivers (heel) when he's healthy and impressive rookie Tyrone Wallace, so he'll have his work cut out for him to be a standard-league asset.

             The Pistons are also sending a first-round and a second-round draft pick for Blake Griffin, Willie Reed and Brice Johnson. Harris could slide right into the starting small forward role alongside Danilo Gallinari (glute) once he's healthy and could see a bump in value with this move since the Clippers have limited firepower. On the other hand, this could be bad news down the stretch if the Clippers scrap their playoff hunt and embrace the tank.

             In terms of fantasy hoops, Griffin's value should be relatively safe in Detroit as he'll remain the No. 1 option on offense there and there won't be a ton of depth behind him. Bradley and Harris also should see a bit of a boost in Los Angeles as they'll be one of the primary options in that offense. Brice Johnson and Willie Reed will also be sent to Detroit as part of the trade.

Griffin's value wouldn't change much with the Pistons.

He'll likely be eased back into things considering he's spent all but 11 games on the sidelines this season, but he's got top-30 upside and needs to be owned in all leagues at this point. Tyron Wallace and Wes Johnson's minutes will take a hit once Gallinari gets back into the rotation.

            Myles Turner will again come off the bench on Monday against the Hornets.
        
        
             Turner is still working himself into game-shape after spending a little over two weeks on the sidelines with the elbow issue, but Turner being a bench player is not expected to be a long-term trend. Domantas Sabonis will get another start tonight, but his minutes should start trending towards the lower 20s as Turner works himself back into the rotation.

            Nikola Mirotic (lower left leg strain) sat out Monday's practice.
        
        
             With the Bulls actively shopping Mirotic, they're likely going to be very cautious with him with regards to injuries, so he could miss Wednesday's game in Portland. We should get more than a few updates leading up to Wednesday's tip, but if he is forced to the sidelines, Lauri Markkanen and Bobby Portis would split most of his minutes.

             It was an excused absence, and the Bulls don't play until Wednesday, so he should be fine. Nikola Mirotic also sat out Monday's practice with a leg strain, and if he can't play Wednesday, Markkanen and Bobby Portis would split the minutes. Stay tuned.

            Joel Embiid (rest) will not suit up for Monday's game in Milwaukee.
        
        
             Embiid logged 36 minutes on Sunday, which the 76ers describe as ""heavy loading,"" and because of that the medical staff will not clear him to play on Monday. He is, however, expected to play in the first back-to-back set of his career on Friday vs. the Heat and then Saturday vs. the Pacers, which likely means he'll have his minutes monitored on Friday. With him unavailable for tonight's game, Ben Simmons, Robert Covington and Dario Saric will be asked to step it up on offense.RotoGrinders.com Daily Slant: Ben Simmons gets a +4.1% usage bump with Embiid out, but his fantasy points per minute mark drops -0.06, and not having Embiid around to take some of the pressure off him makes Simmons a viable GPP fade. Simmons still can't shoot more than 5-8 feet from the hoop, so creating his own shot gets a little tougher without Joel. Dario Saric sees a healthy +3.5% usage boost and a +0.17 FPPM mark.

            John Wall (left knee) is doubtful to play Tuesday vs. the Thunder.
        
        
             Wall underwent an MRI on Monday, but the results of that have not been made public and he's currently headed to Cleveland where he'll receive a second opinion on the knee that required a PRP injection earlier in the year from the doctor who performed his original knee surgery in 2016; so there's some cause for concern here. If Wall can't play Tuesday, Tomas Satoransky would have the opportunity to start and he'd be on the radar as a potential streamer.

             He rolled his ankle during Saturday's game, but he was able to close the game and it sounds like he'll be ready to go on Tuesday vs. the Rockets. He could have more shots coming his way if Aaron Gordon (hip) can't go.

            Aaron Gordon is questionable for Tuesday's game vs. Houston with a strained left hip flexor.
        
        
             Gordon likely picked up the injury while dropping 22 points with 11 rebounds, four assists, one block, one steal and one 3-pointer in 40 minutes against the Pacers on Saturday. Gordon did not practice on Monday, but it sounds like he's day-to-day. Expect an update after the morning shootaround. If Gordon can't play, Mario Hezonja would likely start in his place and has fared well in that role this season, averaging 14.2 points in nine fill-in starts.

             He scored just two points in 24 minutes vs. the Nets on Saturday and didn't play down the stretch. He wasn't aggressive either and added that he hurt his wrist ""a little bit"" in Thursday's game at Golden State. Despite being banged up, season-long owners can deploy him tonight.

             Wall is currently in Cleveland getting a second opinion on his sore left knee. He received platelet-rich plasma injections to reduce the inflammation in his left knee back in late November which sidelined him for nine games, but he's currently listed as day-to-day and should be considered questionable for Tuesday's game vs. the Thunder. If Wall can't go, Tomas Satoransky would be worth a look as a streaming option after scoring 11 points with seven assists in his last start.

Johnson of the Chicago Tribune. The Bulls only play twice this week and we probably won't see him play in either of those. Jerian Grant and Denzel Valentine will continue to benefit in his absence.

             This latest injury report comes from the official game notes, so take it with a grain of salt. The Bucks did not shootaround this morning, so we won't have another update until closer to tip-off. If Brogdon misses his third straight game, Tony Snell and Sterling Brown will see more minutes, but they are not options in standard fantasy leagues.

The Rockets might be cautious with their veteran PG in a game that they should be able to win quite comfortably at home, so keep that in mind. If CP3 can't go, James Harden will have more on his plate and Eric Gordon will gain a significant amount of value.

             In addition to Tuesday's game, Rockets coach Mike D'Antoni does not expect Ariza to play on their upcoming 4-game road trip -- that would rule him out through Feb. 7. With Ariza out, Ryan Anderson should get more shots, P.J. Tucker and Luc Mbah a Moute will see a bump in minutes and it's possible that Gerald Green is back in the rotation. For now, there's no clear beneficiary, but Green does have the highest ceiling with his gunslinger mentality.

             Good luck. At the end of this season,  Noah will have two years remaining on his four-year, $72 million deal he signed in 2016. He has no trade value, so the Knicks would either have to attach a draft pick or young asset in a salary dump or negotiate a buyout. The stretch provision is also an option, but his contract would then clog up their cap space for years.

            Wilson Chandler (illness) did not participate in the morning shootaround and has been downgraded to questionable for Monday's game vs. Boston.
        
        
             He was probable on Sunday, so maybe the illness got worse overnight. He has scored in double digits just three times in January, so fantasy owners should look for a better option if possible. If he can't go, expect the Nuggets to use a committee approach to soak up his minutes, but Torrey Craig is the most likely to see the biggest bump.

Noah wasn't happy about playing just four minutes vs. the Warriors even though the team was shorthanded, and it's not clear when he'll return to the team. He's not in the rotation anyways, so this doesn't have any fantasy implications.

             Coach Tom Thibodeau called for Teague to play in the fourth quarter against the Nets on Saturday, but Teague asked him to leave Tyus Jones in. This explains why he only saw 24 minutes with just two total points. We'll put him on the injury report to be safe, but his status for Monday's game vs. the Hawks is to be determined. If he can't go, Jones would be a solid streaming option and Jamal Crawford would see a bump in value as well.

             Turner returned from a nine-game absence on Saturday, but scored just four points with three rebounds, one steal and five fouls in 11 minutes. ""You could see that he was a little hesitant,"" Pacers coach Nate McMillan said. ""He had an open look that Ive never seen Myles pass up. We knew he would be a little rusty. We wanted to be patient with him and really watch him."" Turner also said he struggled with his conditioning and timing, so don't be surprised if Indiana brings him off the bench again until he's 100 percent.

He has an expiring contract and is now battling a sore right hamstring on top of his groin issue. The Pistons are 3-11 since Reggie Jackson went down and keep sliding in the standings, but their asking price for Bradley is ""significant"" and they are hoping to improve at the deadline as opposed to rebuilding. Wojnarowski adds that Bradley could command in the $20 million annual range in free agency, a ridiculous amount based on his play this season.

             Frye's recent abdomen injury doesn't look like an issue, and this was the first time since early December that he's logged 20+ minutes. Recent reports suggest the Cavs aren't close to trading for Kings' guard George Hill -- Frye was mentioned as a candidate to be dealt, and he's still not a lock to stay in Cleveland through the deadline. It's hard to envision him with reliable fantasy appeal no matter where he finishes the season.

            Manu Ginobili (thigh) returned to action on Sunday with 15 points, four rebounds, three assists, one steal and one 3-pointer in 25 minutes.
        
        
             Manu wound up missing six games and the rest did him well -- he made 6-of-13 field goals and 2-of-2 free throws tonight, and helped the Spurs overcome a poor first half for a 113-98 home win. The Spurs have a light schedule heading into the All-Star break, so Manu's deep-league owners shouldn't have to contend with many DNP-CDs the next few weeks.

            Kyle Anderson was benched to begin the second half on Sunday, finishing a home win vs. the Kings with two points on 1-of-1 shooting, four assists and three rebounds in 21 minutes.
        
        
             Anderson was also yanked in the fourth quarter after San Antonio gave up a quick pair of 3-pointers to George Hill and Vince Carter. He didn't re-enter the game until garbage time, and it looks like Gregg Popovich was sending him a message. Anderson has been raking in the defensive stats as mid-round roto value for the past month, so owners shouldn't overreact.

             Forbes added three rebounds, two assists and zero turnovers in 28 minutes. This was purely a coaching move from Gregg Popovich and there were no injuries involved, so we'll see what happens on Tuesday vs. the Nuggets. Most owners should take a wait-and-see approach here.

             Bertans hit 3-of-7 shots overall and his promotion over Pau Gasol (14 points, 11 boards in 25 minutes) after halftime isn't likely to have long-term repercussions. The Spurs were simply not playing well through two quarters, and Bertans was one of three bench players unexpectedly promoted to jumpstart the team. We'll keep an eye on his role over the next few games.

             Hilliard isn't in the Spurs' rotation most nights and he sat out the fourth quarter until garbage time, resulting in an empty line.

Green's fantasy value was trending up with Kawhi Leonard (quad) ruled out indefinitely, but moves like this make him frustrating to own. That said, we're assuming he'll return to his usual 24-30 minute role vs. Denver on Tuesday.

             Murray was flawless shooting the ball, making 6-of-6 field goals and 2-of-2 free throws. This was his fourth career game with at least 10 points, 10 rebounds and five assists, and the only other Spur with more 10/10/5 games before he turned 22 years old was Tim Duncan. Murray has been even better than expected since taking over the full-time PG job, and he should be locked into active lineups for the Spurs' upcoming three-game week.

             Starter Bogdan Bogdanovic didn't fare too much better with three points on 1-of-7 shooting, but Hield's line was particularly brutal since he didn't contribute in other categories. He came in averaging 18.3 points in his previous three games, on 21-of-39 shooting (53.9%), so owners should give him a pass. He's trending up as a recent lottery pick on a team that's resting veterans.

For now, though, he's just a temporary streamer in deep leagues.

             This was Z-Bo's highest playing time since Dec. 10, but the Kings were coming off two days' rest and playing without Skal Labissiere (left shoulder strain) and Willie Cauley-Stein (knee, foot).

In another bit of good news for fantasy owners, coach Ty Lue didn't ruled out Thomas playing during back-to-back games on Tuesday and Wednesday this week. ""[Thomas] wasnt supposed to [be cleared for consecutive games] at first, but now just said lets see how he feels going into it and well go from there,"" said Lue.

             Dwyane Wade (personal) was out again today, which opened things up for Korver -- he hadn't scored double-digit points or played 23+ minutes since Jan. 8. In his current role, the 36-year-old is nothing but a deep-league 3-point specialist.

             Love added 11 rebounds and one assist without any turnovers. He has a 26.0% usage rate on the season, but that's fallen to 21.9% over the past month -- it's no coincidence that Isaiah Thomas returned in that span. The Cavs' recent struggles have been covered exhaustively, but Love reportedly doesn't want a trade and should settle into a copacetic groove before long. Even with the Cavs in turmoil the past few weeks, he's still quietly producing top-75 value.

             Rose was stretching in the tunnel late tonight, so maybe he was held out as a precaution. It's probably unrelated to this decision, but coach Ty Lue was upset with Rose after Friday's game -- he wanted to check Rose into the fourth quarter, but couldn't because the veteran in the locker room using the bathroom. Whether or not his role improves on Tuesday, Rose isn't a fantasy option at this point.

             Stan Van Gundy mixed things up tonight, promoting Smith while bumping Dwight Buycks ahead of Langston Galloway in the PG rotation. Smith has been unimpressive even with the starting job this season, and he made some poor decisions late in this 121-104 road loss. Reggie Jackson (ankle) could be cleared for basketball activities in a few weeks, so there's no real long-term upside here.

             Buycks was coming off three straight DNP-CDs after coach Stan Van Gundy questioned his ability to handle on-ball defensive pressure. He helped the second unit erase an early deficit tonight, however, and played well enough that he should hold off Langston Galloway (DNP-CD) for the backup-PG job again on Tuesday. He's still not a fantasy option while Smith is healthy.

             Tolliver added three rebounds and five assists, which were one shy of his career-high. Avery Bradley (hamstring) was out tonight which shuffled things up for Detroit, giving Tolliver a rare start alongside Reggie Bullock. The veteran's previous season-high was 18 points and the few owners who deployed him benefited from a fluky game against an awful Cavs defense. These teams square off again on Tuesday, so maybe lightning will strike twice for Tolliver.

             Detroit lost their eighth consecutive game, a brutal stretch that leaves them looking up at the No. 8 seed Sixers. They're still within 3.0 games of the playoff picture and are unlikely to tank unless the losses continue to mount, so for now we're not expecting any drastic rotation changes. Harris didn't have any free-throw attempts or defensive stats in 27 minutes tonight, but he should fare better during Tuesday's rematch vs. the Cavs.

             Abrines is one of the candidates to replace some of Andre Roberson's production, but the early returns weren't encouraging. Terrance Ferguson got the start, and both he and Josh Huestis look more promising for owners scouring the wire in deep leagues.

            Fred VanVleet came off the bench to post a career-high 25 points over just 20 minutes in Sunday's win against the Lakers.
        
        
             VanVleet hit 9-of-13 from the field, including 3-of-4 from behind the 3-point line, and he added a perfect 4-of-4 from the free-throw stripe. Steady Freddy looks to be over the knee injury which cost him two games last week, averaging 15.7 points, 3.7 rebounds, 3.7 assists, 1.3 steals and 1.0 blocked shots per game over his past three outings. The game started to get out of hand, and VanVleet benefited from DeMar DeRozan and Kyle Lowry sitting for large chunks of the second half. Despite the giant game his fantasy value remains limited to deeper leagues unless an injury claims one of the members of Toronto's starting backcourt.

             He made 14-of-33 FGs and 8-of-11 FTs with just one turnover in 41 minutes of action. Westbrook appeared bothered by his left leg or ankle early in the game tonight, but he obviously wasn't limited in the least, so we'll assume he's fine. The win gave OKC an emotional lift after losing Andre Roberson (knee) for the season, and their recent surge has them just 1.0 games behind Minnesota for the No. 4 seed.

             Adams hauled in 10 offensive rebounds tonight, one shy of his career-high. He also attempted zero free throws, which is perfect for fantasy since he's 59.0% at the stripe this season and has been intentionally hacked on occasion. He's making field goals at a 63.5% clip this season, on 9.3 attempts per game, which ranks second behind Clint Capela for category-based fantasy purposes. Add it up and he's flirting with top-50 roto value.

             Ibaka had been struggling on the offensive end lately, but he was solid in this one. His three swats were also his most since he had three blocks back on Jan. 8 in Brooklyn. Hopefully this game spurs him on and his shooting woes are a thing of the past. He'll look to carry over the momentum into Tuesday's game against the Timberwolves.

             George has scored 10+ first-quarter points in four of OKC's previous five games.

             Melo's role might be tweaked in the wake of Andre Roberson's season-ending knee injury, as the Thunder look to compensate defensively. He could play more SF with the second unit, with Jerami Grant or Patrick Patterson at PF, but it's just something to watch over the next few games. He's settled into a nice groove the past few weeks, averaging 20.0 points on 47.4% FGs and 100.0% FTs, with 6.8 rebounds, 2.0 triples, 1.4 assists and 1.0 steals.

             Lowry also managed three assists and a steal while hitting 5-of-12 from the field and 3-of-3 from the free-throw line. While the shooting night wasn't great, he entered just 5-of-24 over his past two with a total of 14 points, so it's a start. He'll be on Team Curry in the All-Star Game, and will actually be working against his coach Dwane Casey. It will be the first time Casey has coached against Lowry since March 7, 2012.

            Jordan Clarkson posted 17 points in just 22 minutes off the bench Sunday at Toronto.
        
        
             Clarkson, who leads the NBA in baskets from a reserve, was 6-of-13 from the field and 5-of-5 from the free-throw line, although he was an ugly 0-of-4 from behind the arc. He and Alex Caruso helped a game destined for garbage time become slightly interesting down the stretch with their heroics off the bench. As long as Lonzo Ball (knee) is on the shelf, Clarkson is a solid fantasy play across the board.

             Nance was an impressive 7-of-8 from the field and 1-of-1 from the free-throw line. He is hard to figure, as he was scoreless on Friday night at Chicago while going 0-of-4 from the field. That came on the heels of a three-game run where he was 14-of-19 (73.7 percent) from the field. He is a decent fantasy option in leagues of 12 or more teams right now, and he is working on an 11-game run with five or more rebounds.

             Lopez wasn't having a very good night working against the likes of Serge Ibaka and Jonas Valanciunas, and his seven missed field-goal attempts tied his second-most dating all the way back to mid-November. He entered the game on a three-game tear, although he continues to see roughly 15-20 minutes per outing. That makes him more of a fantasy option in deeper leagues, and less of an option in most standard formats.

             Ingram is averaging 15.3 points, 8.0 rebounds, 4.3 assists and 1.3 steals per game over his past three outings, and he looks to be 100 percent after dealing with an ankle injury earlier in the month. While he was a woeful 5-of-9 from the free-throw line, that's not an area that is going to change anytime soon. Fantasy owners have to take the bad with the good, and thankfully there has been a lot more good than bad lately.

He is averaging 18.0 points and 10.5 rebounds per game across the past four outings, too, and is playing his best basketball of the season. Randle's playing time continues to trend up and his turnovers are down. That's a tremendous sign as far as his growth is concerned.

He exited under his own power after taking a pair of free throws, but we'll reserve judgment until the test results are disclosed. If he is forced to miss time, Gerald Green, Luc Mbah a Moute and P.J. Tucker should also absorb extra minutes.

             Harrell's playing time was down a bit, as Blake Griffin and DeAndre Jordan were dominating in the frontcourt and were not in any kind of foul trouble. It was just the second time Harrell failed to hit double digits in points over the past 10 outings dating back to Jan. 10. He is worth keeping around on fantasy owners in deeper leagues, but he doesn't do enough to roster in leagues with fewer than 12 teams.

             Earlier in the season this would have been considered amazing, but now fantasy owners have grown accustomed to big lines. He was 9-of-22 from the floor, and 2-of-10 from behind the arc, and now spoiled fantasy owners are disappointed by the misses and his four turnovers. Don't be greedy, though. No one ever expected Williams to post six or more field goals made in 15 straight games. The last time he failed to score at least six baskets was back on Dec. 29.

             Teodosic, who looks a little like a cousin of Dave Grohl from the Foo Fighters, was 5-of-13 from the field and 2-of-7 from behind the arc. He turned it over four times, which is a little high in 28 minutes, but he is now averaging 11.8 points, 5.5 assists and 2.8 rebounds over his past four outings. He has been trending upward lately, the schedule has helped that somewhat, and he won't have another back-to-back situation until Feb. 9-10. It appears the good times should continue to roll for Teodosic's fantasy owners for a while.

             The rookie joins Lonzo Ball, Ben Simmons and Dennis Smith Jr. as the only first-year NBA players with at least 19-6-6 this season. Not too shabby. He was 6-of-12 from the floor and a perfect 7-of-7 at the free-throw stripe. He also contributed a steal while turning it over just three times, which is pretty strong considering how much he handled the ball in this one. While his playing time could potentially take a hit when Danilo Gallinari (hip) is ready to return, add him now in deeper fantasy leagues before he starts to fly off the shelf.

             Jordan did not show any ill effects of the ankle injury which had him sidelined recently, and he excelled with New Orleans short one of their twin towers with DeMarcus Cousins done for the season. The 19 boards were his most since he snagged 20 in Houston back on Dec. 22. There is something about that Gulf of Mexico air that agrees with Jordan apparently.

He didn't have any blocked shots, but he also didn't turn the ball over. Griffin benefited from the Pels being without DeMarcus Cousins down low, although he still had to bump with Anthony Davis, and that's obviously no easy feat. He is averaging 23.7 points, 9.4 rebounds and 5.8 assists over the past seven outings while posting at least one steal in each of the contests.

             According to Basketball-Reference, Jackson is the 21st player since 1963-64 to attempt at least 13 shots without a single make. He's also just the fourth bench player to hit that dubious mark, joining Derrick Favors (2012), Dino Radja (1993) and Junior Bridgeman (1984). His game was distinguished by historically poor efficiency, in other words, and Jackson has a lot to prove to fantasy owners even if his role balloons down the stretch for Phoenix.

             Clark also contributed two assists, two steals and a blocked shot while grabbing a rebound. The former Belmont Bruins standout will see about 15-20 minutes per game off the bench for the Pelicans, and he might be asked to do a little more offensively with the team scrambling around for options after the DeMarcus Cousins injury. But Clark is still only worth a look in the deepest of fantasy formats until further notice.

            Omer Asik contributed with four points across seven minutes off the bench on Sunday against the Clippers.
        
        
             Asik also grabbed three rebounds while posting a team-best plus-12 rating in his limited duty. The 31-year-old Turk will see sporadic minutes in the NOLA frontcourt now that DeMarcus Cousins is done for the season, but he still only moves the needle for fantasy owners in the deepest of leagues at this point unless further disaster strikes the Pelicans.

             Trevor Ariza exited after one minute tonight due to a left hamstring injury, which is why Green resurfaced in the rotation. He was hit-or-miss in an expanded role when James Harden was injured, and is hard to trust in any format even if Ariza misses games.

             Joerger was arguing a call when he suddenly dropped to one knee, and he was soon escorted to the locker room by a trainer. Hopefully it's nothing serious, and it's good to hear the Kings describe his absence as a precaution. Assistant coach Elston Turner took over head coaching duties.

             Moore stepped up, hitting 7-of-11 from the field, while chipping in with two rebounds, a 3-pointer and an assist while turning it over just twice. He appears to be the tertiary scoring option behind Anthony Davis and Jrue Holiday with DeMarcus Cousins done for the season, and it could be a role which suits him very well. He doesn't contribute much to the bottom line for fantasy owners in the defensive categories, but you expect his offensive numbers to trend upward down the stretch.

             Rondo has been struggling mightily at the offensive end, hitting just 34.6 percent (17-of-49) from the field over his past eight outings. Sunday marked his ninth consecutive game with single-digit point totals, too. He is averaging just 4.9 points per game during the span, too. The Pelicans are going to need all hands on deck with DeMarcus Cousins done for the season, but Rondo actually got worse, not better, in this one.

            Luc Mbah a Moute started the second half on Sunday sans Trevor Ariza (hamstring), finishing with 13 points, two 3-pointers, two rebounds, two steals, one block and one assist in 32 minutes.
        
        
             Mbah a Moute is very capable of producing when he's able to flirt with minutes in the 30s, so if Ariza needs to miss time, Mbah a Moute will be someone to think about grabbing in deep leagues. P.J. Tucker finished the game with two points, seven boards and one steal in 26 minutes off the bench, and he too will have the opportunity for extended minutes if Ariza can't play Tuesday. That said, Mbah a Moute is the preferable fantasy target here.

             Holiday seems to be embracing his new role, as he'll be the secondary scoring option in the Crescent City behind Anthony Davis with DeMarcus Cousins done for the season. The guard was 7-of-15 from the field while going 5-of-5 from the free-throw stripe. The biggest surprise was the blocked shots, and you shouldn't count on that being a regular thing. But the 6'4 guard stepped up and did his best Boogie imitation at the defensive end in this one.

             Miller was able to add three assists, two rebounds and a blocked shot across his 27 minutes off the bench, but he hurt the team more than he helped for most of the outing. He and Dante Cunningham will be doing the heavy lifting, trying to fill the void after DeMarcus Cousins went down with a season-ending Achilles' injury this week. It wasn't a good start for the tandem, as they combined for just 11 points, nine rebounds and three assists on 4-of-13 shooting.

             Harden didn't have the best shooting performance, going 8-of-21 from the field and 8-of-12 from the charity stripe, but we doubt his owners are complaining. Trevor Ariza went down just 30 seconds into the game with a hamstring injury, and Chris Paul didn't look quite right during the fourth, so it'll be interesting to see if those guys hit the sidelines on Tuesday with a matchup against the 14-34 Magic. Per nbawowy.com, when CP3 and Ariza have been off the floor, Harden's usage rate spikes to 43.0.

             Cunningham was able to grab seven rebounds while adding a steal, but he hit just 3-of-7 from the field, and he was a dismal 1-of-4 from the free-throw line. He'll likely feature in the starting five down the stretch with DeMarcus Cousins (Achilles') done for the season, but don't be surprised to see Darius Miller also get a chance in the starting group at some point. Neither was very good in this one, as the Pels start life after Boogie with a dud.

             A.D. begins life after DeMarcus Cousins with a bang, also adding two steals and a blocked shot. He also became the franchise's all-time leader in rebounds (3,857), passing David West. It wasn't all great for Davis, as he appeared to tweak his groin near the end of the game on an awkward fall, so it's something to watch. He has had a propensity for injury in the past. With Cousins on the mend, Davis will put up monster nights like this as long as he can stay at 100 percent health.

             Chris Paul had a funny moment during the first quarter in which Greg Monroe was talking junk from the bench, so CP3 responded by burying a jumper and staring at Moose as he ran back on defense. He did sit out most of the fourth quarter despite the game being close, but Mike D'Antoni said the reduced minutes were a pre-planned thing and Paul said he was ""fine"" after the game, so he should be good to go on Tuesday against the Magic.

             Chriss racked up three fouls within his first three minutes of play, and consistent foul trouble has been a serious issue for him this season.

             Harris seems to have avoided anything serious and we should have more details after the game.

            T.J. Warren scored 24 points on 9-of-14 shooting Sunday to go with one 3-pointer, five rebounds, two assists, one steal, one block and two turnovers in 39 minutes.
        
        
             Warren is hitting career-highs in points (19.7), boards (5.3), dimes (1.3), blocks (0.7) and field goal percentage (49.7) this season, and with no one on the roster to really threaten his minutes, theres no reason to expect a sudden post-break, drop-off in production as long as he remains in Phoenix. Devin Booker exited the game early with an apparent rib/hip injury, and if he can't play on Monday, Warren would see a nice bump in usage. Stay tuned.

            Troy Daniels didn't do much through 16 minutes as a starter on Sunday, scoring three points on 1-of-4 shooting to go with one 3-pointer, two rebounds and nothing else.
        
        
             Foul trouble was an issue, but Daniels also appeared to be bothered by his back, which would help explain the lame shooting. The Suns have a quick turnaround with another game in Memphis on Monday, so it wouldn't be all that surprising to see him take the night off for the 17-33 Suns if the back is indeed an issue. The Suns won't have a shootaround on Monday with it being the second game of a back-to-back, so owners probably won't get another update until just prior to tip-off.

            Devin Booker popped off for 31 points, 10 assists, five 3-pointers, three rebounds and three turnovers in 41 minutes on Sunday, but left the game during the closing seconds with an injury.
        
        
             Booker got hurt trying to block a shot from Ryan Anderson, taking a hard fall to his left side, and while he tried to play through it he eventually asked out of the game and went back to the locker room early. He was in some obvious discomfort after the game and told Suns' beat reporter Scott Bordow that he's scheduled to undergo X-rays on his left hip/ribs area in Memphis, so for now, it seems unlikely that he'll be able to get out there on Monday night. If Booker sits, Tyler Ulis would likely return to the starting five with T.J. Warren and Josh Jackson seeing an uptick in usage.

            Bobby Portis cooled off on Sunday with seven points on 1-of-9 FGs and 5-of-6 FTs, adding five rebounds and one assist in just 13 minutes.
        
        
             Portis was rolling in his previous two games, averaging 19.0 points and 10.0 rebounds with supporting stats, but he never got going vs. Milwaukee tonight. He'll be hit or miss while playing limited minutes in a rotation with Robin Lopez, Nikola Mirotic and Lauri Markkanen, but is liable to see his role expand overnight if the Bulls trade a veteran big man at the deadline.

             Grant went off with a 22/13/5 line in 47 minutes on Monday, but he came back to earth in the two games since with averages of 8.0 points, 5.5 dimes, 1.5 steals and 1.0 rebounds. He should be a lock for minutes in the 28-34 range until Kris Dunn (concussion) returns, so you could do worse for short-term help at PG.

             Markkanen had been struggling with his jumper in his three previous games, connecting on just 37.1% of his shot attempts. He wound up 6-of-10 from the field and 3-of-3 from the line tonight, so it was nice to see him get things back on track. Even when his shot isn't falling, the rookie is remarkably dependable from the FT line, hitting 89.8% over the past two months. His rest-of-season value looks safe no matter what the Bulls do at the trade deadline.

             LaVine went 0-of-5 from downtown in the Bulls' home loss, and he's a combined 5-of-28 from the field in the past two games. Fred Hoiberg mentioned afterward that he wants to keep LaVine at one position to help him find a rhythm, so he's basically a strict SG for the moment. Ups and downs are expected from a player returning from ACL surgery, but his minutes are steadily increasing and he's been setback-free since returning in mid-January.

             Bulls coach Fred Hoiberg said his team misses Kris Dunn (concussion) in a ""big way,"" especially Dunn's ability to push the ball and pressure defenses. Valentine played a lot of PG behind Jerian Grant tonight, as the Bulls prefer to keep Zach LaVine at SG -- for now, at least. Valentine's role has increased without Dunn and he's worth a look with Dunn questionable to play during Chicago's upcoming three-game road trip.

             Henson has been riding a mini-hot streak over the past three games with averages of 11.3 points, 6.3 rebounds, 3.0 assists, 1.7 steals, 1.0 block and 1.7 turnovers per contest on 59.1% shooting, which has been good enough for top-75 value in 9-cat leagues.

             Giannis got off to a slow start, missing his first five shot attempts, but he caught fire after halftime scoring 12 of his 27 points during the third quarter of action while rocking a 38.6 usage rate. If we want to nitpick, Antetokounmpo wasn't great from the charity stripe in this one, going 5-of-10 from the line, but he's typically much better than that, so we'd expect a more efficient outing in that area on Monday.

             McLemore had one random 21-point eruption on Jan. 19 but he's otherwise been a non-factor in fantasy leagues this season. There's no reason to think that will change on Monday, despite the favorable matchup.

             Snell tends to be good for some triples when hes starting, but hes far too inconsistent to trust in most leagues. Malcolm Brogdons calf issue doesnt sound serious, so Snell could return to the bench as soon as Monday.

             Bledsoes been in a shooting rut over the past few weeks, connecting on just 33.0% of his shot attempts, and some of that has to do with the fact that hes been settling for tough jumpers more than usual over that six-game span. Hes a career 44.4% shooter, so it should only be a matter of time until he turns things around.

             Ariza injured himself shortly after tip-off in a collision with Marquese Chriss. He did take free throws and walk off under his own power, and was initially called 'questionable' to return, so those are all good signs. Houston's next game is Tuesday vs. the Magic, and we'll consider Ariza questionable for that one. Luc Mbah a Moute, P.J. Tucker and Gerald Green all stand to earn more minutes if he misses any time.

             Monroe disputed a call from the official, picked up a T, continued to argue the call and was quickly ejected from the game ending his evening with eight points, two boards, two assists, two steals and one turnover in 16 minutes off the bench. He shouldn't face any further punishment from Sunday's incident, so owners can plan on having him available on Monday in Memphis.

             Ish Smith is back in the starting five tonight, which isn't a shock since Galloway's minutes have been trending down over the past 10 days.

             Bradley was able to warm up, but his hamstring is feeling sore, and with the Pistons on the second leg of a back-to-back they'll play it safe and keep him on the sidelines. The hamstring injury is new, but this is the same leg that has given him groin trouble since November, so not great. Anthony Tolliver will get the start in his place today, and Tobias Harris will see an uptick in usage.

            Alex Len (ankle) has been ruled out for Sunday's game against the Rockets.
        
        
             Len wasn't able to practice on Saturday, so this isn't surprising at all, and it also seems unlikely that He'll be able to get out there for Monday's game in Memphis. With Len watching from the sidelines, Greg Monroe should be able to flirt with around 20 minutes off the bench, and Dragan Bender could also see some run at the five when Houston goes small.

             This likely means that Greg Monroe will be returning to the second unit, but if Alex Len (ankle) is out, Monroe should still be able to see minutes in the mid-20s. Chandler is little more than a rebounding specialist in deep leagues.

            Malcolm Brogdon (sore right calf) has been ruled out for Sunday's game against the Bulls.
        
        
             This will be Brogdon's second straight game on the sidelines, although he was spotted jumping rope pre-game, so perhaps he'll be able to get back out there for Monday's matchup with the 76ers. The Bucks won't have a shootaround on Monday with it being the second game of a back-to-back, so owners likely won't get another update until just prior to tip-off. Tony Snell will likely earn another start tonight, but he's just a low-end, 3-point streamer in really deep leagues.

             He's still in the concussion protocol, so he obviously won't be taking the court for Sunday's game against the Bucks, but we learned on Saturday that he might travel with the Bulls on their 3-game road trip. The Bulls only have two games next week, so his fantasy owners in weekly leagues should plan on benching him. Jerian Grant has been a hit-or-miss fantasy option in his place and Denzel Valentine has seen a bump in value as well.

If he continues to progress, we should see him back on the court in early February. He'll be eased back into the rotation slowly behind Dwight Howard and isn't an appealing stash for the time being.

He'll continue to be a nice fantasy play while Redick is out, but might see a dip in value if Jerryd Bayless (wrist) returns Monday.

             It's a huge loss for the Thunder on the defensive end -- their starting five had a defensive rating of 95.9 with Roberson on the floor and a 114.5 rating with him off. His absence won't have huge fantasy implications, but Alex Abrines, Terrance Ferguson and Josh Huestise are all candidates to see a bump in minutes. For the time being, none of these guys are worth grabbing in 12-team fantasy leagues.

The Suns will have $20 million to spend this summer if they don't re-sign Alex Len, and they could also open up more space by unloading the undesirable contracts of Tyson Chandler and Jared Dudley. With Devin Booker becoming a superstar, there is a light at the end of the tunnel for the Suns.

             Winderman said that Whiteside loves Miami, but questions whether or not the Heat view him as a franchise cornerstone and if he's happy sharing the workload with Bam Adebayo and Kelly Olynyk. Whiteside has  played just 49 fourth-quarter minutes in January out of a possible 156, so a trade may not be a bad thing for his fantasy value. This is still in the rumor stage and moving his contract would be very tough.

             ""I dont think its anything serious,"" he added, and LeVert added himself it's not serious. The DFS community is feeling this one after LeVert was a somewhat late scratch hours after they said Rondae Hollis-Jefferson and D'Angelo Russell were ruled out, and no mention of LeVert's issue with that update. We all know the Nets will be cautious at any chance they can and LeVert has dealt with this before, so this really isn't that shocking in a back-to-back set. For now, we're expecting him to play on Tuesday at MSG.

He is averaging 18.7 points per game over his past three outings while hitting 56.4 percent (22-of-39) from the field. It was a pretty impressive performance with Jimmy Butler (knee) back from an absence. He is worth using in deeper formats for his scoring, but he doesn't contribute much else across the board.

             Well, OK then. The two-center lineups were getting crushed earlier this year, but they're working now. In the last three games, Nikola Jokic has played next to Plumlee for 64 minutes, posting a tidy +31.3 net rating. Plum's numbers are pretty solid in those, averaging 10.3 points, 7.0 boards, 1.3 steals and 1.7 blocks in 27.3 minutes per game. If you want to roll with him until Paul Millsap gets back next month, it's not a terrible idea.

             With Jimmy Butler (knee) back in action, Bjelica was back out of the starting five and working in a reserve role. He was sharp when called upon, and his recent good showing could have earned him a little extra time at the three. However, his fantasy ceiling is rather limited with the team running back near 100 percent health.

At this point he remains a handcuff option with only slight standalone fantasy appeal.

It appears safe to get him back into the active fantasy lineup, and he faces a four-game schedule in the upcoming week.

             He's one of the most aggressive defenders in the NBA, but his offense is starting to catch up to his defense. It's not the hottest take to say he's the best finisher at the rim among guards with a flashy finish almost every night. Plus, he's made 74 percent at the rim to put him in LeBron James territory -- James has an incredible 77% at rim -- and Harris crushes Kyrie Irving's 63% within three feet. Harris is going to be a fantasy stud for a long time.

             Carroll hit 4-of-12 from the field, and 1-of-5 from behind the 3-point line, while adding 3-of-4 from the free-throw line. He continues to soldier on despite the fact his name is being bandied about in trade rumors. The Pelicans and Pistons are two teams which have been linked to the 'Junkyard Dog', and a move to New Orleans really makes sense now that DeMarcus Cousins (Achilles') is done for the season.

             The specific violation was not revealed. He didn't check in until midway through the first quarter, but did check in a little earlier to start the third. It doesn't sound like this will stick, but Murray did say all the right things after the game. ""Coach did what he had to. I put him in a tough position, and he made the right decision to bring me off the bench,"" he said. Murray still was very busy late in this game and this issue shouldn't affect him going forward.

             Allen was a perfect 4-of-4 from the field and 2-of-2 from the free-throw stripe. It was a pretty impressive night, although he did turn it over twice while finishing with a minus-22 rating, worst in the game. He has been in double digits for points in each of the past three outings, averaging 11.3 points, 7.3 rebounds and 1.0 blocked shots per game. He'll try to keep it rolling Tuesday in New York, and isn't a bad add in deeper fantasy formats.

             He was all over the place with jumpers from different ranges. Jokic has played well next to Mason Plumlee and that lineup doesn't sound like it's going anywhere. On the lighter side of things, Jokic changed his deodorant to women's Dove because he called his other deodorant ""bug spray."" He also hinted that he will continue to wear it.

             He has to be in the MVP conversation now. Since he's returned from injury, he is on one of the biggest heaters of all time among high-volume players.

In simpler terms, he's averaged 31.5 points, 5.3 boards, 6.5 assists, 1.5 steals and 5.9 treys in those dozen contests. Curry is also knocking on the door of a 50/40/90 with his 49.8/43.0/90.9 on the season. He'll go down as one of the best offensive weapons in NBA history.

             Harris went over 30 minutes for just the second time in the past 10 outings, but he saw his double-digit point streak snapped at eight games. He should continue to see a slight bump in playing time as long as Rondae Hollis-Jefferson (groin) is on the mend. With a four-game schedule for the Nets in the upcoming week, the 3-pointer specialist isn't a bad add in some leagues.

             Make that 14 straight games with double-digit points and six straight with five-plus dimes. Smith Jr. was shot out of a cannon for most of his game as he looked for a few highlight plays, but Mason Plumlee had his number with three blocks against him. Coach Rick Carlisle still trusted DSJ to take a big shot to start the last possession -- Plumlee blocked it -- and DSJ inbounded the pass on the final attempt as Wes Matthews missed it. DSJ will have bad shooting games, but he's filling stat sheets. Plus, J.J. Barea getting hurt helps him.

             He is going to see more playing time with J.J. Barea now dealing with an oblique injury. Given Barea's history of mid-body injuries, JJB is probably going to sit out for multiple games. Ferrell gets four games this week, so he's a decent pickup for anyone needing a score-first guard in a pinch.

            Kevin Durant made 7-of-18 from the field for 20 points with nine rebounds, two assists, one steal, one block and one 3-pointer in 36 minutes against the Celtics on Saturday.
        
        
             It looked like coach Brad Stevens tried to take KD away, and it worked with Durant turning in one of his worst games this month. His passing also fell off in a big way after his 25 over the last two while also averaging 6.9 per game in his previous January games. Durant is in the mix to be the best player in nine-category leagues going forward.

            Kyrie Irving was outstanding in a 109-105 loss to the Warriors on Saturday, scoring 37 points with two rebounds, four assists, one steal and five 3-pointers in 36 minutes.
        
        
             He apparently likes to play in Oracle with the biggest shot of his career coming there. Irving actually had all five 3-pointers on the wing tonight, which is much like his huge trey to cause the Warriors to blow a 3-1 lead. Irving got off to an efficient start in this game, starting 7-of-7 from the field to get him to 19 points in just 11 minutes. He's already up to 15 30-point games on the season and taking a game off for his shoulder injury seems to have fixed that mini-slump from earlier this month.

             He played some great defense and even blocked a Kevin Durant 3-pointer -- he's the first person to do that this season. Horford did miss Wednesday's game due to a head injury, but he did not have a concussion. Horford continues to post numbers in multiple categories and he'll get four games this week to add some value.

             Green finished 4-of-11 from the field, including 1-of-4 from the perimeter, while going 6-of-6 from the free-throw line. He also contributed with five assists, three blocked shots and a steal while turning it over four times. It his second double-double over the past six outings. He bounced back nicely after just nine points against Minnesota on Thursday night. Green does so much in so many categories that he is a solid fantasy contributor even when his shot isn't falling.

             The Dubs didn't need Thompson to be at his best, as Steph Curry was ridiculous in taking the team on his back in the marquee matchup. Thompson hit just 3-of-12 from the field, including 0-of-4 from behind the 3-point line. He had made at least one 3-pointer in 95 straight games until Jan. 12. Now, he has three donuts in the category across his past eight outings. Despite his uncharacteristic long distance struggles lately, he continues to give fantasy owners third-round value in standard formats.

             His playing time hasn't really increased when either Kyrie Irving or Marcus Smart (hand) miss time. Rozier is probably going to be more of a hot-hand option for Stevens, so he'll be up and down while Smart is out for two weeks. He won't be in a good spot against the Nuggets on Monday.

             It's safe to say Morris' minutes limit is gone with this game and playing in both of his back-to-back games on Tuesday and Wednesday. Still, he doesn't really do much else besides score, so he's more of a DFS or points guy. He should get minutes vs. Denver on Monday, though.

He was seeing some extended playing time with the game out of hand, and guards Kent Bazemore and Dennis Schroder having absolutely horrific shooting nights. Despite the solid point total Dorsey isn't someone to target for fantasy purposes just yet.

             Collins saw some center minutes in this one, as he has mostly been playing at the power forward position lately. His rebounds were down in this one and he had trouble avoiding the referee's whistle with four personals in just 18 minutes. However, he was able to extend his blocked shots streak to six games. He is a solid source of blocked shots and rebounds in most standard fantasy leagues.

             He was big down the stretch and coach Erik Spoelstra continues to lean on him heavily late. This month, Richardson has played a whopping 10.8 minutes per fourth quarter. Richardson was in a mild shooting slump before tonight, but he made 6-of-13 and all five from the line. He's been a major bargain after that slow start.

He even scuffled at the free-throw line, managing just 3-of-6. The guard saw his 16-game streak with 10 or more points come to a close with the ugly shooting night. Chalk it up as just one bad game.

             He played a lot more than expected, but part of that is because Tyler Johnson played just 21 minutes. Expect Winslow to be closer to 20 minutes on Monday.

             The triples were the good news. The bad news is Prince finished with a dismal minus-29 rating, by far the worst mark for the losing side. He is averaging 13.5 points per game over his past four outings, and he has 2.05 3-pointers per game across his past 21 appearances. Prince should continue to shoulder a heavy load down the stretch for the Hawks.

             He hit a big 3-pointer to ice this game and put the Heat up four. As expected, there was no drop-off here and he closed over Tyler Johnson tonight. Ellington is too valuable for spacing in this offense, so he should continue to see minutes around 30 as he is among the league leaders for 3-pointers the rest of the way.

Adebayo playing well is more of a minus to Whiteside than a plus for himself, so he's more of a 16-team add for now.

             Frazier became the first bench player in NBA history to record at least 14 assists and three blocked shots since blocks were first tracked in 1973-74, according to Elias Sports Bureau. And they're the most by a Wizards reserve since Muggsy Bogues doled out 14 dimes in 1988. He had managed a total of six assists from Dec. 23-Jan. 25 in just three appearances, so he certainly took advantage of the extra run with John Wall sidelined due to a sore left knee.

             The fourth-quarter benching is becoming a serious problem, and not playing well in the fourth on Thursday made matters worse. Whiteside has played in every game this month, but he's played just 49 fourth-quarter minutes in January out of a possible 156 -- one game had garbage time. Tonight was also the fourth DNP in the fourth quarters this month. He's still putting up decent numbers, so his owners can just keep plugging him in.

He continues to play a healthy amount of minutes off the Washington bench, but this was his first game with double-digit points after averaging just 8.0 PPG in a pair of stinkers. He'll look to keep it rolling Tuesday in a rematch with Oklahoma City. He was held to just nine point in the previous matchup this past Thursday.

             The Hornets completely unraveled yet again vs. Miami to drop them to 20-28 because they lost the fourth 24-13 -- they folded vs. Miami on Jan. 20. Walker basically didn't have a backup tonight with Malik Monk only getting seven minutes, so that explains the high playing time. He's been awesome since the Hornets reportedly put him on the market and his owners should be hoping he stays put.

He saw a little extra playing time with a lopsided score on the board in the second half. He was scoreless in each of his past two games, so don't go rushing out to add him off the waiver wire. He is on there for a reason. He remains useful only in the deepest of fantasy formats at this point.

             Beal hit 5-of-11 from the field, and 2-of-4 from behind the arc, while knocking down 6-of-6 from the free-throw stripe. He was nothing special while the team tried to fill the void with John Wall (sore left knee) on the shelf. Of course, the Wizards fans aren't complaining since they won on the road by 25. Beal is averaging 24.8 points per game in 13 games with Wall on the sidelines, or basically just slightly more than his overall average of 24.0 PPG. And really, that average during Wall's absence is skewed heavily by his 51-point effort on Dec. 5. When Wall is sidelined, it is usually others stepping up to fill the void.

             Apparently, he doesn't like to play the Heat because he continues to make silly turnovers in key moments. That issue aside, he was playing his best ball of he season and he seems to have fixed his shooting woes.

             That right knee issue is basically a distant memory with Dipo being a 22/5/5 guy on great percentages while being among the league leaders for steals in January. Oladipo has also been incredibly busy in the fourth since returning, posting a 39.2 usage rate in the fourth quarter this month. He's looking like a great bet for first-round value in nine-category leagues.

OPJ finally looked comfortable after exhibiting a little bit of rust in his first couple of games back from a hip injury. The Wizards have a three-game schedule in the upcoming week, starting with a home date against the Thunder on Tuesday.

             Satoransky was in the starting five with John Wall resting his sore left knee. The Czech small forward hit 3-of-5 from the floor, including a perfect 3-of-3 from behind the arc, while turning it over just once and finishing with a plus-12 rating. If Wall is forced to miss another game on Tuesday against Oklahoma City, Satoransky might be a useful low-cost option in DFS play.

            Markieff Morris finished Saturday's win at Atlanta with 23 points across 30 minutes to tie a season high in points.
        
        
             Morris was a very efficient 9-of-13 from the field, including 4-of-5 from behind the 3-point line, while adding five rebounds, three assists and a steal. He picked up some of the scoring slack with John Wall sidelined due to a sore left knee. Morris is averaging 21.5 points and 7.0 rebounds per game over the past two after a five-point stinker on Monday in Dallas. He scored 20 points with nine rebounds and two steals over 38 minutes against Oklahoma City on Thursday, and the Thunder is the team's next opponent on Tuesday night.

             Myles Turner returned and looked rusty, but Sabonis was almost certainly going to close regardless of how Turner played. Sabonis was also outstanding in this comeback win to help the Pacers win the fourth 30-20. It's going to be very interesting to see how coach Nate McMillan handles the minutes for his centers, and the Turner-Sabonis combo was starting to work, too.

             Even without the scoring output, it was one of his better games on both ends as he continues to establish rapport with the other perimeter Pacers. Stephenson is usually in the lower 20s for playing time, but Bojan Bogdanovic wasn't up to par. Stephenson will have his ups and downs.

             He didn't have a formal minutes cap, but the team said they were going to monitor him. The rust was there with five fouls, but chances are Turner was slated to play more tonight based on Al Jefferson playing 13 minutes. Turner has almost no chance to meet his ADP value, but his high-floor game makes him a prime buy-low target.

             To end the game, he got fouled with seven seconds left with the Magic down two. Gordon missed the first and missed the second on purpose, which dropped him to 3-of-8 from the line today. Gordon has resembled a more traditional power forward lately with four straight double-doubles while he's also struggled mightily from the line in that span. He'll need to get the FT% fixed to be an early-round guy going forward, which is certainly possible.

Considering his ankle problems in the past, his owners may want to make sure he's good for Tuesday in Houston. We'd expect him to play.

             He was in foul trouble in this game and had some tough covers against the Pacers wings. Simmons also missed the last shot of the game with an open 3-pointer to cause the Magic to lose by two. Foul trouble has cut his playing time in two of his last three games, but Simmons usually finds himself getting minutes in the mid-30s. He's a fine hold.

Nikola Vucevic (hand) is getting a little closer and should be back next month, so Biyombo's fantasy value likely has an expiration date. Keep rolling him out there for now unless you really don't care about the next 2-3 weeks.

The Magic aren't going to be winning many games and it'll be interesting to see what happens with Birch once Nikola Vucevic comes back. He's a sneaky add in very deep leagues for his per-minute upside.

             He's been one of the best under-the-radar defenders in the NBA, but Terrance Ferguson looks to be ahead of him in the wing pecking order. Huestis doesn't really have much offensive output, so leave him on the wire in even very deep leagues.

             It wasn't the most exciting 25,000th point as he made a free throw to get him there. Anthony joins LeBron James and Dirk Nowitzki as the only active players in the 25K club, and he's the 21st player overall to hit this mark. It's a fun coincidence that he reached this milestone against the team that drafted Darko Milicic ahead of him.

             Maybe commissioner Adam Silver saw the first quarter today before making the move because PG-13 tore it up with 16 points in 12 minutes, finishing with 26 points, three rebounds, two assists, three steals and four 3-pointers against the Pistons. George has really broken out as a scorer lately and he's been to the line 35 times over his last four games. George will be joining LeBron James' team in Los Angeles later this month. Of course, Lakers fans will probably hope that statement is true this summer.

             Free Boban please, SVG. He helped get the Pistons within range as he dominated Patrick Patterson.

            Stanley Johnson did not score with one rebound, one assist and no turnovers in 11 minutes during a start against the Thunder on Saturday.
        
        
             He got the business from Paul George today. Coach Stan Van Gundy pulled Johnson aside multiple times, so maybe this start was a teaching moment. Either way, Reggie Bullock outplayed him again, so Johnson is probably losing the starting job his next time out.

             Awful news. This will mean three NBA players would be out for the season based on the news in the last 24 hours (Conley, Cousins). Patellar tendon surgery has a difficult rehab and Roberson is going to have a tough time being ready for the start of next season. The Thunder will have to lean on Terrance Ferguson, Alex Abrines and Josh Huestis more now with Ferguson deserving a fantasy look in deeper leagues.

             He is finally back after he's been out since Jan. 9. Turner's minutes were dropping just before his injury and perhaps it was related to his elbow injury. Due to injuries and Domantas Sabonis playing well, Turner has been a letdown in fantasy. There's still time for him to get it going as a buy-low option.

He's only shooting jumpers now and he's not going to play on Sunday. For now, his fantasy owners should consider him doubtful to play on Wednesday.

            Lonzo Ball (knee) was getting shots up at practice on Saturday.
        
        
             He is not expected to play on Sunday against the Raptors. Coach Luke Walton has also said Ball needs to go through a full practice before he's back in the lineup. After Sunday, Ball should be considered between doubtful and questionable on Wednesday in Orlando. Alex Caruso has stepped up the most while Josh Hart and Julius Randle also get more chances.

            Rudy Gay (heel) is expected to return to the lineup after the All-Star break, according to Jabari Young of the San Antonio Express-News.
        
        
             He is recovering from right heel bursitis he suffered last month, and there haven't been many updates on him up until now. Gay was feeling soreness in his right heel in November, and again Dec. 3. He played 13 games after that, and then an MRI spotted the bursitis. If you're stashing Rudy, it may be a couple more weeks before he's out there.

             Welcome to NBA news in 2018. Just about all signs point to Butler returning today with coach Tom Thibodeau saying Jimmy is ""close"" to a return, so it sounds like he's back after missing a week. We'll be looking for additional confirmation, but for now pencil him in as the starter in this home game. Nemanja Bjelica will take a hit here and would become a drop candidate.

            Derrick Rose said coach Ty Lue was mad at him because Lue wanted to put Rose back in the game on Friday, but he couldn't because Rose was in the bathroom.
        
        
             He said it blows his mind that players can play for so long and not have to take a bathroom break with so much hydration. Rose had arguably his best game of the season with 14 points in 15 minutes and he could get even more playing time while Dwyane Wade (personal) is out. Of course, he'll have to time out his bathroom breaks better.

             He is questionable to play against the Rockets and it's certainly possible he misses his third straight game. Len had some major ankle problems earlier in his career, so the Suns won't be pushing him to return. Greg Monroe may be worth owning again.

             That should mean he'll be back for Sunday against the Rockets. Chandler was a surprise scratch on Friday night due to an illness, which led to a Greg Monroe start. His return should take minutes from Dragan Bender, Jared Dudley and maybe Marquese Chriss, assuming Alex Len is out.

             It's possible he will start, but the Pistons haven't revealed that just yet. His return should take minutes away from Stanley Johnson and maybe even Luke Kennard. Bullock's upside isn't high enough to add in most 12-team leagues.

             He said that Tuesday is a possible return date, and apparently there's an outside chance he can return tomorrow. The Clippers have said they won't rush Gallinari back, so it's possible he won't be back for a few more games. Tyrone Wallace and Wes Johnson would be taking a hit once Gallo is back.

             The Bucks are hopeful that Brogdon wouldn't miss multiple games after missing Friday's outing. The team also said they've been monitoring Brogdon's calf for a while, so it sounds like this could been a lingering issue. Tony Snell would probably start again, but he's really not an add.

             He's not going to play Sunday and traveling on the road trip doesn't necessarily mean he will play. As of Friday, Dunn still had headaches and as of Saturday he hasn't done any tests to progress towards a return. Jerian Grant has fizzled out lately while Denzel Valentine has benefitted with Zach LaVine playing more point guard.

             This could be nothing, but that's no fun. The move of Devin Booker at the point should be opening up some wing minutes as the other two point guards lose playing time.

             This confirms the multiple reports from Friday night. He will have surgery, miss the rest of this season, and he's reportedly expected to have a 6-10 month rehab. Cousins is also entering free agency this summer at age 27 and this could affect his market. He's 27 years old and bigs like Elton Brand fell off in a big way after a rupture, so Boogie has a huge hill to climb -- Brand was 28 when he tore his in 2007. It'll also be very interesting to see how the Pelicans approach the playoff race for the remainder of this season.

            JaMychal Green (ankle) is ""expected to return within the next week,"" according to the team.
        
        
             He suffered the injury on Saturday night, and it didn't look like it would keep him out for multiple weeks. However, the Grizzlies basically just announced their tank today, so expect for Green to have some restrictions even when he's back. While he's out, Jarell Martin should put up some nice value and he's worth an add if you need a big man with some upside.

             The Nets downplayed his right groin strain after he suffered it on Friday, but the Nets are always cautious and this is a back-to-back set. This is Hollis-Jefferson's first noteworthy bout with a groin injury, so hopefully he can get back out there against the Knicks on Tuesday. For tonight, DeMarre Carroll should slide over to see more minutes at the four, which opens up more run for all the wings. Quincy Acy should also benefit and may actually start against Taj Gibson.

             The team is calling it ""return from injury management"" and it's not a surprise he's not playing in a back-to-back set yet. Russell continues to look extremely rusty as a scorer, and his seven turnovers in 21 minutes on Friday were almost inexcusable. For tonight, Caris LeVert is a big winner while Joe Harris, Allen Crabbe and DeMarre Carroll also benefit.

             Although the news isn't shocking, considering the Grizzlies have essentially already been eliminated from playoff contention, it's still obviously a tough blow for Memphis fans and Conley owners. GM Chris Wallace said that Conley ""has been extremely diligent as we pursued multiple different approaches to alleviate the pain before deciding surgery was the best solution."" Conley hasn't played since early November, but made some progress in his rehab. However, the ""pain/soreness persisted."" Conley is expected to make a full recovery prior to 2018-19 training camp. Andrew Harrison and Mario Chalmers will continue to divvy up minutes at point guard.

             Butler has missed each of Minnesota's last four games, but appears to be on track to return for this contest. However, the Wolves tip off at 9:00 pm EST, which means we likely won't have a final update on Butler's status until after the 7:00 pm DFS main-slate roster lock. If Butler is cleared to play, Nemanja Bjelica will get bumped back to the bench.

Satoransky will be worth consideration as a streamer or an affordable DFS punt on Saturday night. Tim Frazier will back up Satoransky and will see an uptick in minutes off the bench.

             Wall received platelet-rich plasma injections to reduce the inflammation in his left knee back in late November, which caused him to miss a total of nine games. He has started each of the 21 games the Wizards have played since. However, per coach Scott Brooks, Wall has dealt with left knee issues during this Wizards current road trip, and it became evident Thursday in OKC that ""something was wrong."" Brooks said Wall is day-to-day. Wall said he plans to travel to Cleveland next Monday to get a second opinion on the knee. Tomas Satoransky will start at PG on Saturday.

             Turner has missed each of the Pacers last nine games but appears to be inching closer to a return. He was able to practice fully with the team on Wednesday and Thursday. Domantas Sabonis has been starting in Turner's absence. If Turner can suit up on Saturday, he'll likely come off the bench behind Sabonis, as the Pacers will look to limit his minutes in his first few games back.

             Gambadoro tweeted out earlier this week that, ""there is no scenario in which the Suns will sit down a player for the season this year. The goal is to try and win games."" Tyson Chandler didn't play in a single game following last year's All-Star break, but it appears that will not be the case in 2018.

             Bullock was initially listed as questionable on the injury report released Friday. The upgrade to probable puts him on track to return to the lineup Saturday night. Assuming Bullock returns to the starting lineup on Saturday, Stanley Johnson would get bumped back to the bench. Johnson had seven points and five rebounds in 39 minutes as a starter on Wednesday.

I think its a day-to-day thing.  Im an optimistic guy, and I know we need him."" Joe Harris and Quincy Acy would soak up additional minutes if RHJ is ruled out Saturday.

             He's probably going to be a meme after he took a ball to his face during warmups (video in link below). Porzingis has also looked a lot better as a shooter lately after a really rough start to January. Before tonight, he only had a 40.7 FG% in January, but he's been above that mark in each of his last seven games. He leads qualifiers in blocks and he's sitting pretty at the line at 80.8 percent from the line, so he's a rare commodity in fantasy.

             He did have to go to the locker room after a hard foul from Devin Booker, but did return. He was just being tested for a concussion, and nothing really suggested he was concussed after his return. The NBA medical staffs have initially missed concussions recently for guys like Jamal Murray and Kris Dunn, so Hardaway Jr.'s fantasy owners may just want to make sure everything is good. He'll also start a back-to-back set on Tuesday, so don't be surprised to see him sit out that after missing time due to a leg stress fracture.

Dropping him for Burke makes sense, too.

             Make it back-to-back games with 18 points with Burke also going 3-of-3 for strong games during his outings in the MST time zone. The Knicks are probably going to turn it over to Frank Ntilikina at some point, but he's not really giving them any reason to as Burke plays well in almost all of his chances. He's not a must-grab player in fantasy, but he has to be worth a look in leagues where point guards don't last on the waiver wire. Don't be surprised if he unseats Jarrett Jack to possibly boost his value, too.

            T.J. Warren scored a team-high 20 points during a 107-85 loss to the Knicks on Friday, adding four rebounds, one block and two 3-pointers in 34 minutes.
        
        
             The Suns got worked on defense yet again and that's been a major problem lately. Warren is dropping 20 is becoming old hat with him hitting that mark in five of his last six active games. The move of Devin Booker to the point shouldn't affect his numbers at all.

             The Suns are grasping any answer they can find in their backcourt. After the game, coach Jay Triano mentioned he didn't like how that first unit played today, but chalked it up to defense. Daniels is worth a look if you need 3-pointers, but Darius Miller may be the hotter add tonight.

In his last four games, 51.1 percent of his shot total has come in the paint with him making 15-of-22 in that range. Stats wise, he's averaged 15.0 points, 3.0 boards, 0.5 steals and 1.3 treys in those four. It will be a bumpy ride, but Jackson is starting to gain some appeal as a stash thanks to his position flexibility.

             The rust was there on both ends, but at least he only had three fouls. It took like two months for Chriss to finally get going this season, so hopefully it's not a repeat there. Dragan Bender has lost all of his momentum, Alex Len is banged up, and the Suns will really want to see if Chriss can be a center in some matchups, so Chriss' opportunity is as high as any young big man. He should be owned in standard leagues.

After a rocky start to the season, DSJ looks like he could be a fantasy stud down the stretch.

Monroe is basically the last man standing and could see big minutes against the Rockets on Sunday. He's worth a look with no other healthy centers on the Suns as of Friday night.

His short-term value is basically gone, but he's a decent stash in deep leagues. He lost a lot of upside after so many duds. He did play some center, but he looked bad in that role, too.

With the game out of hand for most of the evening, Gasol was rested for large chunks of the second half, giving his still healing wrist extra rest. Joffrey Lauvergne saw a bigger role off the bench, and he had the hot hand in his action. Despite the poor outing, Gasol remains a top-100 fantasy option across the board.

             His first half was ridiculous with 22 points in the first 15 minutes of action -- he was 9-of-10 from the line in that time and finished 12-of-14. Williams becomes the first player since 1982 to put up a 40-point, 10-dime game off the bench (Brian Winters). Williams has been one of the best steals in fantasy and the Clippers playing well is huge for his value.

             Parker was coming off the bench again, as Dejounte Murray flirted with a double-double in his fourth consecutive start. Murray has flourished since moving into the starting five, so it's unlikely Parker sees his role change anytime soon. his sporadic DNPs and limited minutes make him a less-than-attractive fantasy play most nights.

             Green was a dismal 1-of-7 from the floor, including 0-of-5 from behind the 3-point line. He was able to salvage the stat line with three rebounds, three assists, a steal and a blocked shot, but he is on fantasy rosters for his 3-pointer ability. He'll look to get untracked on Sunday against the defensively-challenged Kings, a team allowing 106.4 PPG this season.

             This will end his season and make him questionable to start the 2018-19 season. According to this report, he will have surgery as soon as possible, and then begin a difficult rehab. ESPN also reports that his recovery time ranges from 6-10 months. Plus, his size will make it even tougher with guys like Elton Brand never really looking the same after an Achilles tear.

             Aldridge was out of the lineup Wednesday, as he was getting a rest to recharge his battery. It appears to have worked, as he hit 7-of-12 from the field while going 4-of-4 from the free-throw stripe, and he added three rebounds with a blocked shot across his 33 minutes. The rest of the team probably could use a rest, too, as they were hammered by the visitors 97-78. Aldridge was the only player in the starting five to hit more shots than he attempted.

             It was a quintessential big Wes line with his output in defense and little else. Johnson has been terrific as a three-position player and has seen minutes in the low 30s lately. However, Danilo Gallinari (hip) and Austin Rivers (foot) are both on the comeback trail, so Johnson's value could be taking a hit soon. He should have around another week of value.

             TLC was making another start with Jerryd Bayless (wrist) on the shelf. That's the good news. The bad news is that Bayless is targeting a return on Monday in Milwaukee, which will mean a drop in minutes and fantasy value for Luwawu and T.J. McConnell. Until then, enjoy the ride. TLC is an especially solid mid-tier DFS option while in the starting five.

             It was a strange night for Lillard, as he didn't score until 3:54 left in the first half. We later learned that he was battling an upset stomach before the game due to something he ate, but he looked fine in the second half. The All-Star PG finished 9-of-18 from the field and 8-of-11 from the line, and now he has several days off to rest up before Tuesday's game vs. the Clippers. We're leaving him off the injury report.

While the overall performance was a step back from the triple-double he dropped Wednesday against Chicago, the point total was his most since he dropped 26 points on Jan. 3, also against San Antonio.

             He still put up a decent game because DeAndre Jordan had some foul trouble. The Clippers are winning games now and their odds to make the playoffs went up, so that makes it less likely DJ is dealt. Harrell is more of a drop than a luxury stash in 12-team leagues.

             He leads the franchise in triple-doubles and has really become part of the team's identity. The Grizzlies were starting to get it going earlier this month with a three-game winning streak from Jan. 15-19, but they've lost three of their last four with three home games in that span, too. Expect some trade rumors on Gasol, which would likely hurt his fantasy value.

             Zach LaVine and Justin Holiday were a combined 5-of-25 from the field, so the Bulls relied on Valentine quite a bit tonight. He hit 6-of-11 shots in 30 minutes, snapping a streak of three straight games with single-digit points. His value has fallen off a cliff since Zach LaVine got back and it's unlikely to trend up too much with LaVine's workload getting larger by the day. He's more of a deep-league guy.

He also added four rebounds, two assist and a steal and did not turn the ball over once. With the exception of a poor shooting performance last Saturday against Golden State, Gordon has been a tremendous fantasy option despite coming off the Houston bench. He has two or more 3-pointers in 15 of his past 17 outings.

             He stepped up a ton with Tyreke Evans and Ben McLemore out for this one. That's his second 17-point game in his last three and his first double-double of the season, as well. The Grizzlies could be trying to showcase him a bit for a trade, so maybe he gets more run in the next two weeks. He's still more of a stream option while Tyreke Evans or Mike Conley are out.

He hasn't had any giant stat lines since returning from his hamstring injury, but does have back-to-back double-doubles as he slowly ramps up his production to the standards we've grown accustomed to seeing.

            Clint Capela was good for eight points, 10 rebounds and a blocked shot over 30 minutes in Friday's 115-113 loss at New Orleans.
        
        
             Capela hit 4-of-6 from the field while turning it over four times. His playing time was a bit limited due to foul trouble. He'll look to a bounce-back game Sunday afternoon against Phoenix, the worst team defense in the NBA. Still, a 10-rebound performance isn't anything to sneeze at.

            Ryan Anderson finished scoreless with a minus-20 rating in Friday's 115-113 loss at New Orleans.
        
        
             Anderson was 0-of-3 from the field, including 0-of-2 from behind the 3-point line, while adding just three rebounds across 14 minutes. He has been terrible over the past five outings, posting just 5.4 points - or nearly half of his season average of 10.1 PPG. Anderson has been dismal since around Christmas when he started to power it down on the offensive end. At this point you just have to hope for a turnaround, as he can be helpful as a forward in the 3-pointer category when running hot.

             Jarell Martin looked very good in the first unit and is probably going to see even more playing time. Rabb may see more minutes later in the year, but he won't have much short-term value.

             He's been a great story as the Clippers continue to send him down and call him up from the G League almost every day. His minutes could be taking a hit soon with Danilo Gallinari (hip) nearing a return, so his owners in deeper leagues may want to plan to make a move soon.

             Coach Fred Hoiberg questioned his shot selection tonight and said he ""settled"" for some long mid-range 2s. ""I felt good. I just missed a lot of easy shots,"" LaVine said. ""I have to be better. Tonight, I sucked. Its a process. It gets frustrating at times. You want to smooth it out."" The good news is that he played a season-high 26 minutes, and coach Fred Hoiberg is confident he'll get better when he becomes more comfortable with his teammates. He averaged 20.0 points, 6.0 rebounds, 2.5 assists and 2.0 triples in his previous two games, so this was just an off night and LaVine's owners shouldn't be concerned.

             He did most of his damage early with a 14-13 line with eight minutes left in the third quarter. Gobert did get the business from Jonas Valanciunas at times, but he also did very well on the offensive glass with five on that end. He's looked a lot like the player his fantasy owners thought they were getting based on his play since his return, averaging 15.6 points, 10.8 boards, 1.2 assists, 3.0 blocks and 0.8 steals in those five. The Jazz winning three of their last four is big, too.

             His third quarter changed the flow of the game with 15 points in that frame, which matched Utah's entire 15-point output in the second quarter. On the last important offensive possession, Mitchell also had a smart pass out of a double-team to get Ricky Rubio a wide-open, game-winning triple. Mitchell is special in more ways than one and looks like he'll be an early-round fantasy contributor for over a decade.

Plus, the Jazz may try to make a push for the playoffs with this huge road win. Favors should be considered as a hold.

             The Jazz went with a decent amount of Royce O'Neale to combat the Raptors size, so Burks didn't step up too much. He should still be the beneficiary from the Rodney Hood (leg) injury and apparently Hood has an excellent chance to be traded.

Normally a solid performance and win against a good opponent would be time for jubilation, but the feeling was rather grim in the locker room after as DeMarcus Cousins (Achilles') is expected to miss the remainder of the season due to a torn Achilles' tendon. Holiday should scoot up, serving as one of the primary offensive scoring options behind Anthony Davis.

             His free throw shooting woes won't be going away any time soon and he was hitting 67.8% from there prior to Friday, but at least he got his rhythm from the field back -- he was a combined 6-of-24 in his previous two games. Ingram played 33 minutes for the second straight game tonight which is an indication that his ankle injury is behind him, and he racked up nine rebounds with five assists and one steal to go with three turnovers. After a tough couple weeks, hopefully Ingram is ready to heat up.

             It was an uninspiring performance for Rondo, who was able to at least dish out six assists while adding one rebound and a steal across his 17 minutes. He and the remainder of his teammates will be tasked with filling the void left by DeMarcus Cousins (Achilles'), who is expected to miss the remainder of the season due to a torn left Achilles' tendon.

            DeMarcus Cousins has suffered a torn left Achilles tendon and he will miss the rest of the season, according to Adrian Wojnarowski of ESPN.com.
        
        
             Ugh. There is still no official word on the MRI, but Woj adds the diagnosis is ""clear"" that it's a tear. This is a franchise-changing injury for the Pelicans and it'll be interesting to see if they are more willing to trade Anthony Davis. Cousins will also be considered doubtful to start his 2018-19 season, and this could affect his free agent market as an unrestricted free agent at age 27. In the fantasy world, his fantasy owners just got a death blow and can drop him in redraft formats. Darius Miller looks like the best pickup because Dante Cunningham doesn't offer much fantasy upside, and maybe the Pelicans look to sign someone. Perhaps they even trade for someone like Greg Monroe. Get well soon, Boogie.

             Brook has been a headache to own in fantasy all season, but he had some extra motivation tonight with his brother Robin trash talking before the game. ""Just general, overall basketball IQ,"" Robin said when asked what Brook's biggest weakness is. ""Actually, just overall IQ.""  Brook ultimately got the last laugh, hitting 7-of-13 shots in what was Los Angeles' fourth straight win. This was his first time hitting the 20-minute mark in his last eight games, so this doesn't move the needle much.

             Davis was a solid 10-of-22 from the field while hitting 7-of-8 from the free-throw stripe. Normally it would have been a feel-good performance and good win against the contending Rockets, but the excitement was muted when DeMarcus Cousins (Achilles') went down with what appears to be a season-ending injury. That latter part still needs to be confirmed, but it appears 'The Brow' will be without his partner in crime for a while.

             ESPN reported basically the same thing as we await for confirmation. This is one of the biggest blows of the NBA season as players show support for the 2018 All-Star on Twitter. If it is an Achilles tear, Cousins is going into a contract year and he'll have one of the toughest rehabs in pro sports ahead of him.

             The line wasn't terribly impressive, but his role could change soon. DeMarcus Cousins (Achilles') left with what is believed to be a torn left Achilles' tendon, so Cunningham, Darius Miller and perhaps even Cheick Diallo could be in line for a bump in playing time, responsibilities and fantasy appeal. Cunningham isn't a high-usage player and is only worth a look in very deep leagues.

             Miller hit 6-of-11 from the field, including 6-of-10 from behind the arc, while adding 2-of-2 from the free-throw stripe. He could be in line for a huge bump in production and responsibilities, as DeMarcus Cousins (Achilles') left the game late due to injury. Boogie will have an MRI to determine the severity of his injury. If he is forced to the shelf, Miller and Dante Cunningham should be among the biggest beneficiaries.

             He did a good amount of this when Rudy Gobert was on the bench, but he still had Gobert's number at times in the second half. Valanciunas showed some of his best rapport with DeMar DeRozan, which wasn't the case at all last year as JV did most of his work off Kyle Lowry. Valanciunas is flying high over his last five, averaging 15.2 points, 11.4 boards, 1.8 assists and 1.6 blocks in 23.8 minutes. If you bought low earlier this month, you're looking like a savvy fantasy owner.

             Joseph's minutes were back down with Darren Collison back from a personal issue after missing Wednesday's game. It's uncertain if Collison will need to take further time away from the time in the future, so perhaps Joseph sees a bump in production from time to time. However, he remains more of a fantasy option for those in deeper leagues at this point.

             The overall line wasn't terrible, but it was a far cry from the 22 points he dropped on Wednesday against Phoenix. That was his first 20-point effort since Nov. 29, and Friday's performance is a little more along the lines of what you can expect as a fantasy owner and potential DFS player. He'll continue to log heavy minutes while Myles Turner (arm) is out, but you should only expect mid-round fantasy production with an occasional big game.

            Sterling Brown played 27 minutes off the bench with four points, nine rebounds, one assist and one block.
        
        
             Even with Giannis Antetokounmpo back, Brown logged decent minutes because Malcolm Brogdon (calf) was out.  Brown was tased on Friday morning for a traffic violation and might face some discipline down the line, but he's not on the fantasy radar in most formats while Giannis is healthy.

            Joseph Young played just five minutes off the bench Friday in Cleveland, finishing with a scoreless effort.
        
        
             Young was back to the bench and back to obscurity after making his first NBA start on Wednesday with Darren Collison away from the team for personal reasons. Collison was back, and Young's minutes dwindled down to nothing. At this point he is only worth stashing as a speculative pick in the deepest of fantasy formats.

            Lonzo Ball (knee) is not expected to play on Sunday vs. the Raptors.
        
        
             According to coach Luke Walton, Ball has been doing some shooting and dribbling drills on the court, but he hasn't practiced with the team yet. The Lakers aren't putting a timetable on his return and Walton wouldn't commit to Ball playing during this road trip. Tyler Ennis hasn't done much as a starter in his absence, but Alex Caruso has played well and is worth a look in very deep leagues. Jordan Clarkson is the biggest beneficiary, though.

He has been in quite the mood for thievery lately, averaging 4.0 steals over his past three outings, and at least two thefts in six of his past eight contests.

            Coach Alvin Gentry said DeMarcus Cousins suffered an Achilles injury, but doesnt know the severity.
        
        
             ESPN adds that Cousins is going to get an MRI to check on how bad it is and there is ""significant fear"" that the injury is serious. This is terrible news for one of the league's most fun players to watch and the Pelicans will likely have to change their course for the rest of the season. Unfortunately, the Pelicans will likely have to turn to Darius Miller, Dante Cunningham and E'Twaun Moore to help out Jrue Holiday and Anthony Davis. Miller is probably the best pickup, especially if you need 3-pointers.

             Sabonis was a very efficient 7-of-10 from the field while going 1-of-1 from behind the arc and 2-of-2 at the charity stripe. He also chipped in with two assists and a steal. He isn't a great fantasy contributor in roto leagues due to his lack of defensive stats, but those in standard formats aren't complaining about his production too vehemently.

             He continues to chip in for the non-scoring stats and the minutes should always be there for one of the league's best perimeter defenders. Wright won't blow you away most nights, but he is still a hold in 12-team leagues. He's basically the new version of Danny Green.

             He was 5-of-7 from the field, 2-of-3 from the line and finished with a +25 in his 28 minutes. He continues to fly under the radar and has been a reliable asset in two-center fantasy leagues for weeks. The Bucks are expected to actively pursue a center and have been linked to DeAndre Jordan, so Henson's owners will be hoping for a quiet trade deadline.

He'll continue to fill in when Isaiah Thomas needs a breather, but Thomas is almost back to full speed and Rose has a propensity for injury. Expect Rose to see rather limited minutes on nights Dwyane Wade is also available, as the team tries to preserve him down the stretch for a postseason run.

             ""I feel great, I'm ready to go,"" Antetokounmpo said before the game. ""[I'm] feeling energized."" Well, he wasn't lying. Antetokounmpo was a handful all night and was getting whatever he wanted -- the Nets also had no answer for him defensively with Rondae Hollis-Jefferson (groin) leaving the game early. He hit 14-of-20 shots and 10-of-11 free throws with 13 rebounds, seven assists, two steals, two blocks and three 3-pointers, and with the Bucks fighting for playoff seeding he should be locked in as a top-5 fantasy asset going forward and that's being conservative.

             This looked bad. Cousins planted his left foot and put some stress on the back of his left foot. He was in a lot of pain and did not put any weight on his left leg as he went to the locker room. It's possible he is dealing with an injury that will keep him out multiple games here. While he's out, Darius Miller and Dante Cunningham should see more minutes. Miller is probably the pickup here.

             Thomas hit 5-of-13 from the field, including 2-of-8 from behind the arc, and he also had two rebounds and a blocked shot. That's all well and good, but he turned it over five times, too. The turnovers wouldn't be so bad if he had a triple-double like LeBron, as that masks the 11 turnovers he had. But a dismal shooting night and several turnovers shows that IT still has a long way to go before returning to the fantasy heights we saw pre-injury in Boston.

             That's the bad news. The good news is he salvaged his line with nine rebounds, four assists and just one turnover, and he also played 29 minutes after playing 22 or less in three out of his previous four games. He's trending down, but it would be wise to hold him until we know more about the severity of Rondae Hollis-Jefferson's groin injury.

             He logged 26 minutes on the night, adding three rebounds, three assists and three 3-pointers. Harris has been on fire in January, hitting 55.3% of his shots with 12.4 points, 3.6 rebounds, 1.0 assists and 2.2 triples prior to Friday. He put up those numbers in 26.4 minutes per game, but should be able to flirt with 30+ minutes if RHJ misses time. The Nets play four times next week, so he should be on your radar.

             Blame it on the new OVO jerseys? After his head-turning 40 points on Saturday, Lowry has been on the other side of the spectrum with only 14 combined in his last two. Not coincidentally, he only went to the line three times in these two duds. Lowry has no shot to match his career-best 22.4 points per game from last season and is just at 16.5 on this season, but he's still filling it up everywhere else.

             Russell was having a really tough time for most of the night, but right after turning the ball over for a sixth time, he went on a run for eight straight points at the end of the third quarter and put Thon Maker on skates for one of his driving layups. He had some wild passes and is clearly still working off the rust, but his 14 points were more than his last three games combined (11) and he played his most minutes (21) since returning from his knee injury. He'll get there, but it will take some time.

             Smith ended up 8-of-15 from the floor, including 7-of-13 from behind the arc, and he turned it over just once while posting a game-best plus-14 rating. While Smith did a pretty decent job, the team folded down the stretch in the fourth quarter. On their white board after the game, the schedule showed ""feature length"" film session set for noon on Saturday. The drama continues in Cleveland, even after a win.

             Allen's first basket of the game came on his team-high 52nd dunk of the season which is more than the next three highest Nets combined (16 for Rondae Hollis-Jefferson, 16 for Caris LeVert and 14 for Timofey Mozgov). It looked like he was going to close his second game in a row, but Jahlil Okafor checked in for the last few minutes of garbage time. Allen is now averaging 12.0 points, 8.5 rebounds, 1.0 assists and 1.0 blocks in 21.5 minutes over his last two games, and while he's still more of a stash, it's not a bad idea to pick him up and see if he can keep it going.

He posted 18 points and eight assists in just 28 minutes in the first meeting with Detroit on Nov. 20, resting for a good chunk of the second half due to a lopsided score.

             Coach Mike Budenholzer said Prince had to play ""smarter"" after the loss on Wednesday, which explains why he played just 13 minutes. Prince did have his fair share of mistakes tonight, but he wasn't taking bad shots and had a couple savvy defensive plays. He's been a disappointment so far, but more work down the stretch makes him a hold in standard leagues.

             It was one of those gross games from Dennis Schroder, so Delaney capitalized and closed this game out. Schroder has not played well at all lately and we may be seeing more of Delaney. If you're desperate for a point guard in a deep league, maybe he can help you out.

             It was a terrible game on both ends with some silly fouls and poor shot selection. Schroder did not play in the final 6:32 of this close game with Malcolm Delaney taking over. We've seen Schroder find himself in the doghouse more than most starting point guards, so a bad game is just part of the package. He'll have a tough matchup against the Wizards on Saturday and he'll be risky in DFS.

             He was 2-of-11 from deep in his NBA career tonight and has looked more confident with his jumper lately. Collins did struggle with the size of Dwight Howard at times, but so did all of the Hawks bigs. Miles Plumlee has only played 10 minutes in two of his last three games, which should help Collins get minutes closer to 30 minutes soon. He should be owned in all standard leagues.

             He threw a wild pass out of bounds and immediately started limping. The Nets had to foul to get him out of the game and they ruled him out for the rest of the night during halftime -- he checked out with 6:24 left in the half. This is the first time he's been on the injury report with a groin injury this season, but hopefully it's not too serious. The Nets were getting crushed, so maybe the lopsided score factored into their decision. Joe Harris started the second half and would be worth a long look for his 3-point shooting if RHJ misses additional time.

Coach Doc Rivers has said multiple times that he won't rush Gallinari back, and chances are he will have a minutes limit upon his return. He's having a brutal season, but he's not a bad stash if you can afford it.

             It seemed like it was only a matter of time before Ulis was bumped from his starting job. It'll be interesting to see if he gets knocked out of the rotation with Isaiah Canaan also outplaying him. Ulis is a drop candidate.

             He's still not practicing, so it's not a surprise that he will miss his second straight game. Len has had ankle issues for years, so expect the Suns to err on the side of caution moving forward. Greg Monroe and Tyson Chandler will soak up the center minutes, but Monroe is clearly the better fantasy option.

             It's about time. The Suns haven't got anything out of their point guards for weeks now, so moving Booker over there makes a ton of sense. He gets a slight boost with some extra eligibility, but he was basically running the offense.

             Leaf has played nine or fewer minutes in his last three games, so this doesn't have many fantasy implications. For what it's worth, coach Nate McMillan said Alex Poythress might pick up a handful of minutes tonight.

Durant has been fantastic as a shooter and there's little reason to think he won't be playing in the national TV game. For what it's worth, KD's right foot was the one he had surgery on back in his OKC days.

For tonight, the Cavs are making some changes to their lineup, so Derrick Rose, Jae Crowder and Jeff Green could be seeing more shots in the second unit.

             He made contact to Hassan Whiteside's knee brace on Thursday to cause the damage. Cauley-Stein has really been the only stable thing in the Kings frontcourt rotation with Skal Labisisere dealing with a shoulder issue while Zach Randolph and Kosta Koufos rest. Presumably, the Kings opt to play Z-Bo and Koufos while they rest Vince Carter, George Hill and Garrett Temple more often. Or perhaps Georgios Papagiannis gets playing time. Any of the above bigs could be pickups, but it's possible this situation just gets even more messy.

Assuming he didn't have a setback that the Heat aren't telling us about, Johnson should have a good chance to play. His return should take minutes from Derrick Jones Jr. and Justise Winslow, but Wayne Ellington should still get plenty of chances to hoist treys.

             That means he should be all set for a great matchup in Brooklyn tonight. Bledsoe continues to lead the NBA in steals and really hasn't fallen off at all next to Giannis Antetokounmpo and Khris Middleton. The coaching change with Jason Kidd shouldn't affect him negatively.

            Malcolm Brogdon (right calf soreness) is listed as out in the game notes for Friday's contest against the Nets.
        
        
             This is the first time Brogdon has appeared on the injury report for a calf injury and last weekend he missed a game for personal reasons.  Brogdon exploded for a career-high 32 points in his last game way back on Monday, so maybe the Bucks are just giving him a few days off before they play the Bulls on Sunday. If he is out, Tony Snell and Sterling Brown could pick up some extra run along with Matt Dellavedova.

             It is important to note that being cleared for basketball activity is different than being cleared to return to game action. However, Jackson is making progress and could be back around the All-Star break. Yet, it's safe to assume that the Pistons will limit Jackson's minutes once he can begin playing games. Ish Smith will continue to start at point guard for Detroit in Jackson's absence.

D12 has been on fire of late, averaging 16.7 points, 16.0 rebounds and 3.5 blocks over the Hornets last seven games. He's an intriguing DFS option for Friday.

Make sure he is locked and loaded in all fantasy lineups this evening.

            Kevin Durant dropped his second triple-double of the season during a 126-113 win over the Wolves on Thursday, scoring 28 points with 10 rebounds, 11 assists, three blocks, two steals and six 3-pointers in 37 minutes.
        
        
             It's the first time in his NBA career that he had double-digit dimes in consecutive games after his career-high 14 helpers on Tuesday. Durant has also been ridiculous as a shooter since he returned from injury eight games ago, averaging 26.3 points, 6.3 boards, 7.5 dimes, 1.4 steals, 1.3 blocks and 3.4 treys on a 69.7 TS% and a 27.6 usage rate. That includes a 64.5 eFG% on his 100 jumpers in that span while he's only been blocked twice on his 133 attempts overall in this stretch, as well. LeBron James made him the first pick in the All-Star Team draft and it's easy to see why.

            Klay Thompson scored 25 points with five rebounds, three assists, one block, one steal and seven 3-pointers on 9-of-13 from the field in 36 minutes against the Wolves on Thursday.
        
        
             Those seven treys match his season-high as he bounced back from scoring just 17 points combined in his previous two. Thompson made the All-Star Team again and Stephen Curry added him to his team as a reserve. He's been quietly consistent as a third-round value in standard leagues this season.

             The Warriors put on a passing clinic again with 37 dimes on their 48 makes.

He's the captain of an All-Star Team for a reason.

             The Warriors turned to their death lineup more than usual to help Iguodala get to double-digit scoring for the first time since Jan. 4. His playing time is down overall with a lot of rest, so fantasy owners really can't add him.

             That scoring output tops the 27 combined from his previous two games, and it's the first time he's scored 30-plus points since Dec. 14. Towns had just his third game with at least 20 attempts from the field as the Wolves fed him inside all night. The Wolves just had a brutal stretch of games against the Warriors, Blazers, Clippers, Raptors and Rockets over their last five, but now they get a couple easier games against the Nets and Hawks. Expect KAT to feast in those.

             He saw some tough defense all night from Kevin Durant and Andre Iguodala. Wiggins exploded for 24, 40 and 29 points in the three previous games without Jimmy Butler (knee), but Butler was very close to returning today. Wiggins' recent uptick could go away vs. Brooklyn on Saturday.

             He did most of his damage in the third with three 3-pointers in that frame. Bjelica continues to see heavy minutes with 36 coming on Wednesday, and he didn't even close today with Jamal Crawford getting the nod next to the other four starters. Jimmy Butler (knee) has to be getting close to a return, so Bjelica's fantasy value may be running out.

             Coach Mike Malone had a very interesting comment before the game, saying Jokic was becoming ""too reliant"" on 3-pointers. ""When that three is not going in, you have to find other ways to get to the post, get to the foul line or shoot a mid-range,"" Malone said. That may be a little harsh from Malone because Jokic was lighting it up from deep at 40.6 percent in his first 20 games. Either way, Jokic should put up huge numbers.

He's not just taking 3-pointers as the offense is running through him more than ever these days.

Malone has said he'll be keeping his starting lineups secret because he doesn't want to tip his hand to the opposition, so we'll probably be in the dark for the foreseeable future as he plays the matchups. Considering Plumlee would be taking a hit once Paul Millsap returns, he's not a strong pickup unless you really need a big in the short term.

             Revenge game? Chandler was a ghost on the stat sheet recently, failing to top eight points in all of his previous six games. It looks like coach Mike Malone likes him in the second unit and he's still be able to play 30.0 minutes per game in his two games off the bench. He's still not really an add in 10- or 12-team leagues.

             It was his first 20-point game since Jan. 8 with Lyles struggling to hit jumpers. Lyles has still be coasting over his last 20 games with mid-round value, but his fantasy owners may want to prepare for a hit coming when Paul Millsap returns next month. Although, maybe he can hold value and Mason Plumlee will be the one taking the big hit.

             He fouled out with 4:49 left in the fourth, so Porzingis did look to be on track for his normal playing time. The Knicks do have a back-to-back set coming up on Friday and then another one on Jan. 30-31, so his fantasy owners will make to make sure he's a go. The Knicks won't be shooting around at Phoenix tomorrow, so be careful in DFS.

While he should get better and can be considered as a stash, there's probably a better option on your waiver wire without the high profile. Plus, Trey Burke playing well isn't going to help The Frenchise.

Hernangomez is reportedly on the trade block, but the Knicks may also deal KOQ as they fell to 21-28 today. It's probably time to start stashing Hernangomez in competitive leagues.

He could be a drop candidate very soon or even now if you're the proactive type.

             He still managed to find minutes thanks to Kristaps Porzingis getting into some foul trouble. Beasley did only play 14 minutes in the last game KP played next to him back on Sunday, so it may be tough for him to get over 24 minutes on a nightly basis. Still, he's been able to fill it up and it's possible KP needs miss a game on a back-to-back set on Friday.

             The Knicks went with a lot of two-point guard lineups and it turns out Burke benefitted the most with Tim Hardaway Jr. not playing tonight. Burke only played nine minutes in the previous two games combined with garbage time being a factor on that, so it's still tough to totally buy this output. With THJ back in Phoenix, Burke will be a risky DFS play. He's only an add if you're desperate and this point guard situation is shaping up to be a mess.

Kelly Oubre playing well means Morris will have to have a strong game to close.

            Marcin Gortat scored four points with one rebound, one assist, three turnovers and five fouls in 21 minutes against the Thunder on Thursday.
        
        
             The playing time has really fallen off lately at just 19.5 minutes per game over his last four. Some of this is because of the Wizards playing from behind with coach Scott Brooks looking to go to Kelly Oubre more late in games. Gortat's drop in playing time combined with his woeful 48.5 percent from the line this month basically puts his value at rock bottom. He's typically been a very strong finisher on the season, so most owners should hold unless there's something attractive on the wire.

             He continues to find minutes and this time at was at Marcin Gortat's expense as the Wizards failed in their comeback attempt. Oubre has seen consistent minutes with 29.3 per game over his last nine with the Wizards being fairly healthy in that span. He did have two quiet games in a row with this one and a seven-point Monday, but Oubre should still be held in fantasy if he's going to continue to flirt with 30 minutes per game.

             The right hip strain didn't affect his playing time, but Porter did struggle with his shot again at just 4-of-11 from the field. He's had some issues lately at just 38.3 percent from the field in his previous games this month, including 28.1 percent from deep. While Porter isn't getting as many open looks compared to last year, he's still one of the best shooters in the game and should snap out of it soon.

             He had the play of the night so far with a putback jam with three seconds left to help the Kings get a their eighth win on the road (video in link below). Even before that jam, Fox had a couple of his usual highlight reel plays to show off his speed and his abdominal injury didn't seem to affect him. The Kings look like they'll be resting either George Hill or Garrett Temple most nights, which should keep Fox's minutes close to 30 per game. If he can hit shots, Fox should start to trend up in all leagues.

             He came out hot in the first half with 15 points in his first 12 minutes, including 13 in the second quarter. Hield did also come up big as he closed this game out with seven points in the final six minutes to help the Kings earn a rare win in Miami -- they haven't won in Miami since 2001. Hield still needs to do more than just score, but he does look to be trending up.

             He did not play on Tuesday with Koufos alternating his DNPs over the last four games. Skal Labissiere does seem to be playing through his left shoulder injury, so that could help Koufos stay in the lineup more often. He can't be counted on in almost any league right now.

             His left shoulder is clearly bothering him and he was grabbing it in pain during the second half. Labissiere has been on the injury report for a left shoulder and he missed a game back on Jan. 17 because of that. Expect him to be on the injury report for the foreseeable future and the Kings may be cautious with him until the All-Star break.

            Josh Richardson made 2-of-13 from the field for six points with seven rebounds, five assists, three steals and one turnover in 36 minutes against the Kings on Thursday.
        
        
             The shot wasn't falling and coach Erik Spoelstra still trusted J-Rich to take the last shot -- he missed the contested 21-foot jumper. Coach Spo was also bothered by the play of his first unit to start the second half, and he pulled the other four starters besides Richardson with 8:40 left in the third. Spo and his fantasy owners should completely trust him these days.

             After missing two games, he looked fine and made 8-of-14 from the field. Dragic did most of the damage in the first half with 16 points before half, and he ran the offense more than usual late in this game. The schedule gets a little softer for the Heat with only two games

Nemanja Bjelica gets another start and is still a hold in 12-team leagues until Jimmy gets the all clear.

             He's going to test out his knee in warmups and the team will go from there. Butler has been out since Saturday due to knee soreness and it's been Nemanja Bjelica taking over for most of the minutes at the three. Andrew Wiggins has also seen a sharp increase in productivity while Butler has been out.

Hardaway Jr. played 35 minutes on Tuesday night and he's scored in double digits for each of his last four. The Knicks also have another back-to-back set on Jan. 30-31. For tonight, Michael Beasley, Courtney Lee and the point guards get a small boost to minutes.

            Coach Mike Malone said he was confident Gary Harris (foot) would be able to play on Thursday.
        
        
             He is technically a game-time decision, but it sounds like Harris will be out there after suffering a bruised mid-foot injury against the Suns. Harris has struggled to stay healthy at times, so hopefully this new injury doesn't turn into something else.

            Rodney Hood (leg contusion) will not play against the Raptors on Friday.
        
        
             No surprise here as the Jazz will keep their oft-injured for at least four games. It's possible the Jazz are being extra careful with Hood because he's reportedly on the trade block. Alec Burks is a decent pickup in 14-team leagues while Joe Ingles and Joe Johnson could also benefit.

             Dragic has missed two games with a bruised right knee, but it sounds like he made it through warmups without any setbacks. It's a favorable matchup vs. the Kings defense, and owners should plug him back into active lineups.

             Len is dealing with ""soreness"" but the fact that he couldn't practice doesn't bode well for Friday. Ankle injuries have plagued him throughout his career, so maybe the Suns are just being extra cautious. If he can't play Friday, expect Greg Monroe and Tyson Chandler to do the heavy lifting.

             To be very clear, this isn't an imminent concern. It only came up because of a report that Irving threatened to have surgery and sit out the 2017-18 season if the Cavs didn't trade him this summer. According to Cavs writer Joe Vardon, ""Irving needs minor knee surgery as a follow to the procedure he underwent during the 2015 Finals to repair his broken knee cap. It's not pressing ... but the procedure would ease some of the swelling and day-to-day pain he feels."" Irving did bang his left knee during Tuesday's game, but dismissed it as ""a little sore,"" and there's no reason to think he'll miss games.

             Crawford looked fine while scoring 19 points in 20 minutes during his return on Wednesday. The Wolves may just be playing it safe with their veteran in the second half of a back-to-back set, and it still sounds like he'll suit up. Check back closer to tip-off.

            Kris Dunn (concussion) still has no timetable for a return.
        
        
             He hasn't made much progress yet and still has symptoms. For now, we'd be very surprised if he played on Friday vs. the Lakers. Jerian Grant and David Nwaba will benefit in his absence, while Zach LaVine could play 26-28 minutes according to coach Fred Hoiberg.

             He left Monday's game early with a right hip strain and that injury has been lingering, but he practiced on Wednesday and should see his normal allotment of minutes if his hip holds up. His season-long owners should activate him on a four-game slate.

             The Cavaliers are going to switch things up after losing six out of their last seven games. Tristan Thompson will now start at center, pushing Kevin Love to PF and LeBron James to SF. Crowder has been a major disappointment this season and the move to the bench probably won't help his fantasy value, but he did score in double digits in each of his last three games with seven total 3-pointers in that span.

            Tristan Thompson will replace Jae Crowder in the starting lineup going forward according to coach Tyronn Lue.
        
        
             Lue has been contemplating a lineup change for a while now and has finally pulled the trigger. With Thompson at the five, this will push Kevin Love back to his natural position at the four. The Cavaliers have lost six of their last seven games, but we'll see if this move pays dividends starting on Friday vs. the Pacers. Thompson is hitting 60.9% from the line this season, but he should get a bump in minutes with this lineup change and will be a nice source of rebounds.

            The Kings have made Malachi Richardson ""available"" in trade talks.
        
        
             Skal Labissiere is also available, but you'd think he's less likely to be moved. The Kings are in advanced talks with the Cavaliers to acquire Channing Frye, Iman Shumpert and draft compensation for George Hill, but they would need to clear a roster spot first. The 22-year-old Richardson has played just 12.8 minutes in 24 appearances this season, but it's hard to imagine him becoming relevant in fantasy if he's moved.

             He's been battling an illness for a while and has fallen completely out of the rotation. ""I said to Coach [Michael Malone], Im ready if you need me, "" Hernangomez said. ""I dont say I need to play. Of course I want to play. But I dont [put] pressure on him, because hes the coach and he makes the decisions."" Unless the Nuggets decide to move Wilson Chandler at the deadline, Hernangomez doesn't have a great path to minutes.

Westbrook said it was ""outrageous"" that George wasn't voted in despite averaging 20.9 points, 5.6 rebounds, 3.0 assists, 2.1 steals and 3.1 treys per game. If you're an OKC fan, then George's All-Star snub may turn out to be a good thing in the long run.

George Hill was rested last game, but expect him to be active just in case Fox isn't feeling 100 percent. It's currently unclear if Garrett Temple will play or rest.

I could look at last year when I was injured and I didnt have a great year in Toronto, I was considered a salary dump. Now, this year youve got a number of teams that really want me."" The Nets love Carroll's leadership, but they would certainly entertain offers if they could get draft compensation in return. He's been linked to the Pelicans and Pistons so far, and a move to a playoff-bound team could be bad for his fantasy value.

            Wes Johnson had another well-rounded line on Wednesday with 10 points, four rebounds, four assists, four blocks, two steals and two 3-pointers in 35 minutes.
        
        
             Johnson has emerged as a sneaky fantasy option over the past two weeks, averaging 13.0 points (47.3% FGs, 75.0% FTs), 5.5 rebounds and 2.3 triples. He's even more appealing in category-based leagues in that span, thanks to his steals (0.7), blocks (1.0) and low turnovers (0.8). Danilo Gallinari (glute) is getting ""closer"" but doesn't have a clear return date, so owners should stick with Wesley while he's hot.

             Tatum has been incredibly efficient this season, especially for a rookie, but he was a shooting a combined 9-of-28 from the field (32.1%) in his previous three games. He went 7-of-16 tonight and finished with his third-highest usage rate of the season (25.1%). That's due partly to the absence of Al Horford (head), but he'll need to stay aggressive for Saturday's game in Golden State.

             Ojeleye went 3-of-5 from the field with one steal in 18 minutes tonight, and he hit a pair of big 3-pointers to keep the Clippers at bay in the second half.  He's been a sporadic part of the rotation and earned more minutes with Al Horford (head) out tonight, so Ojeleye remains just a guy to monitor in deep leagues.

             The Celtics were without Marcus Smart, who cut his hand at the hotel and needed stitches. It's unclear how long he might be out, and there's some mystery around the situation with coach Brad Stevens saying the team was ""doing more research"" to determine what happened. If Smart does miss more games, the main beneficiaries are Rozier and Shane Larkin (five points, four assists in 24 minutes).

             Doctors declared Horford concussion-free after taking a hit on Tuesday and the Celtics erred on the side of caution by keeping him out tonight. It's likely just a one-game situation, but Morris' role with 24-28 minutes is safe either way. This is the first time he's played back-to-back games all season, indicating that his left knee soreness is finally behind him.

             Galloway had overtaken Dwight Buycks for the backup-PG job, and Stan Van Gundy gave him another promotion tonight ahead of Ish Smith (14 points in 33 minutes). It was still Smith who played the lion's share of the minutes, but owners who speculatively added Galloway should give him another game or two. It helps that Reggie Jackson (ankle) still doesn't have a clear return date.

             He was on fire to start the third quarter with 13 points in that frame as the Blazers erupted for 43 points to put this game out of reach. Lillard has been on serious cruise control since returning from injury with at least 21 points and six dimes in each of his last eight games. There's a reason he made the All-Star team and his owners should expect top-10 value out of one of the league's best scorers.

Towns still leads the NBA in double-doubles and owns a tidy shooting line of 54/41/84 before tonight.

             The Grizzlies were patching together the frontcourt rotation tonight -- Ivan Rabb started but struggled with fouls, and both he and Henry could fall out of the rotation when Jarell Martin (knee) and JaMychal Green (ankle) return to action. Also in the mix are Brandan Wright (12 minutes) and Deyonta Davis (21 minutes), and this is a situation to avoid entirely outside of deep leagues.

             Tyreke Evans (illness) was out tonight, leaving 31.2 minutes and a 28.3% usage rate up for grabs. Memphis was blown out in the second and fourth quarters tonight, and none of their players logged more than 30 minutes, resulting in a mess for fantasy purposes. If you picked up Selden after his random 31-point explosion on Saturday, maybe give him another game or two before asking for a refund.

             Rabb started due to the absence of Jarell Martin (knee) and JaMychal Green (ankle), but even that didn't last long with Myke Henry replacing him to start the third quarter. He couldn't get out of his own way with foul trouble tonight, but either way he's not a fantasy option with Martin and Green day-to-day.

This was one of his best fantasy outings all year and it snapped a streak of four games with single-digit scoring.

             Parker has taken his demotion to the bench in stride. ""He thought it was good for the team to give Dejounte [Murray] a chance to see what he could do,"" said Gregg Popovich. ""He was mature. That really made it easy on me to make the decision."" The bench role hasn't hurt Parker's production, but limited minutes and sporadic DNPs make him undesirable in typical leagues.

            Taurean Prince had two points on 1-of-3 shooting, two rebounds, one steal and three turnovers in just 13 minutes vs. Toronto on Wednesday.
        
        
             Hawks coach Mike Budenholzer said Prince's minutes were limited tonight because he needed to play ""smarter,"" but fantasy owners shouldn't overreact. Bud also recently said the Hawks ""want [Prince] to keep shooting and keep driving,"" and Prince himself shrugged off his recent shooting slump, saying his shot was ""just asleep for a while ... now it's awake."" Tonight's quiet game was a bump in the road, but he's poised for a big workload in the Hawks' final 35 games.

             The veteran played 20 minutes tonight, but neither he nor his teammates could gain traction in a blowout loss to the visiting Raptors. Ilyasova didn't have any assists, steals or blocks to compensate for his offensive no-show, and this is his third consecutive dud. He's been a solid fantasy option for most of the season, so we'll continue to cut him slack.

             Hawks coach Mike Budenholzer mentioned Kent Bazemores defense on DeMar DeRozan as one of the only bright spots for Atlanta tonight, so that's something. We haven't heard any trade talk surrounding him lately, but Adrian Wojnarowski did report that the Hawks view him as ""expendable."" It's a situation to monitor as the Feb. 8 trade deadline approaches.

             Toronto's long-term aspirations for Siakam are intriguing. ""We want [Siakam and OG Anunoby] ... to handle the ball in transition, to bring the ball down, to be that point-four, point-three, bringing it down to trigger the offense,"" said coach Dwane Casey. For now, they'll settle for solid defense, rebounding and hustle in transition. Siakam also needs to improve his shooting range, since he's just 16.1% from deep this season. He's on the radar in deeper leagues, but most owners can ignore him.

             This is just what JV's owners needed after his scoreless, 11-minute dud vs. Minnesota on Saturday.

             The second-year guard hit 6-of-9 FGs and 3-of-3 FTs and didn't turn the ball over. The caveat is that the bulk of his damage came in garbage time with Kyle Lowry and DeMar DeRozan sitting out the entire fourth quarter. There's no short-term impact, but it's a reminder of VanVleet's potential if he's ever turned loose.

             Toronto came in with a healthy roster and they're surging at the right time. The schedule also works in their favors -- 10 of their next 13 games come at home, and amazingly they won't play a road game vs. a Western Conference team for the rest of the season. They're within 1.0 game of the Celtics for the top seed in the East, and will look to keep it going vs. Utah on Friday.

             The rookie's minutes have steadily increased, and coach Stan Van Gundy wants Kennard's usage rate to follow suit. ""Im trying to get him to be more aggressive,"" Van Gundy said. ""Were running more plays for him ... not just in shooting but in terms of making plays, drawing people to him."" SVG backed up that statement by having Kennard take the potentially game-winning shot in regulation. He's crept inside the top-150 this month and could go higher if he follows his coach's advice.

             The veteran made 5-of-10 shots with just one turnover in 36 minutes, and he's playing with renewed aggression in the absence of Rodney Hood (leg). That's great news for a Jazz team that badly needs shooters to spread the court, and Ingles should be a steady value at least until Hood returns.

             Rubio also made 4-of-8 field goals and 2-of-2 free throws tonight for an all-around solid line. Despite some rocky stretches in his tenure with Utah, Rubio is clinging to late-round value and the assists and steals he provides aren't easy to duplicate on the waiver wire.

             Simmons hauled in 11 boards in the first quarter alone, which were the most for a Philly player in any quarter since Samuel Dalembert in 2010. He got his triple-double faster than any rookie has done it in 20 years, and he's also the first player with multiple trip-dubs vs. the Bulls in a single season since Darrell Walker in 1989-90. We're going to hear plenty more historic parallels for Simmons in the coming years -- if you own him in a dynasty points league, start engraving the trophy now.

             The Rockets were firing away from deep as per usual with 51 attempts, making 21 of those. Harden posted his first double-double of 2018 after he posted three in his final four games of 2017. Harden's numbers are down basically everywhere this month, but that makes sense based on how he had a minutes limit to start 2018. He'll be flirting with top overall value in nine-category leagues.

             T.J. McConnell (personal) was out tonight, joining Jerryd Bayless (wrist) and J.J. Redick (leg), so the Sixers' backcourt was running on fumes. Garbage time was also a factor, allowing James Young to score four points in 12 minutes, while Larry Drew II played nine minutes. None of these guys are fantasy assets, but Anderson is the best of the bunch.

             His 12 points are the lowest he's had since Jan. 3 and he made just 3-of-12 from the field in this win.

He hasn't blocked a shot in seven straight games but is otherwise making the most of his playing time, and the real incentive to own him is the looming trade deadline -- the Bulls are one of the more obvious teams that should unload veterans like Robin Lopez or Nikola Mirotic. If you can hold him, it should pay off.

            Wesley Matthews scored a season-high 29 points with four rebounds, five assists, two steals, one block and seven 3-pointers in 38 minutes against the Rockets during a 104-97 loss on Wednesday.
        
        
             He's on one of his best runs as a Mav with his 16.0 points per game in his previous January outings, adding averages of 3.6 boards, 2.6 assists, 1.1 steals and 2.9 treys. Matthews is seeing some huge minutes and he'll get a revenge game against the Blazers on Friday -- he scored 23 against them on Saturday, as well. Matthews is trending up and is basically a must-start fantasy option.

             Coach Rick Carlisle said he was sick a couple days ago, so apparently there's a bug going around with the Mavs. Nowitzki's minutes were down in this game, so this news explains that. He should be OK for Friday against the Blazers.

             LaVine added seven rebounds, three assists and one steal. He's is slowly rounding into form despite Chicago keeping him on a strict minute-limit, and said recently that his conditioning is ""about 70 percent."" So far, so good for owners who patiently awaited his return from ACL surgery since draft day.

             Markkanen finally snapped an 0-of-15 drought from downtown in the third quarter, the first time he'd made one since Jan. 17. He didn't have any defensive stats tonight, but he also didn't turn the ball over, and the low playing time was due to Chicago's starters getting blown out. He'll fare better vs. the Lakers on Friday.

             Grant was scoreless during a lousy first half in which his plus/minus rating was -23 in just 13 minutes. David Nwaba took his spot to open the third quarter, but this was likely just a one-time move vs. an unorthodox opponent with a 6'10"" point guard. Kris Dunn (concussion) is ""almost certain"" to sit out Friday, in the words of coach Fred Hoiberg, so Grant should be in line for one more start at a minimum. It also sounds like he suffered nothing worse than a fat lip after being elbowed in the mouth by Joel Embiid tonight.

             He was on a serious roll coming into this game with at least 15 points in each of his previous six games. Smith Jr. was still able to get his dimes in this game and it's rare for young point guards to have success against Chris Paul. DSJ's owners should give him a pass here and can expect a better game against the Blazers on Friday.

             Kaminsky did his damage in just 21 minutes tonight, benefiting from a plethora of silly fouls from the Pelicans. This doubled his previous season-high for free-throw attempts in a game, and fell one short of his career-high for makes. He's hovering around late-round value the past week, but unless his minutes increase he'll be an unreliable 12-team option.

""He owned the rim [during Monday's victory]...Blocking shots, changing shots and getting the rebounds."" Howard was terrific again tonight vs. DeMarcus Cousins and the Pelicans, but it wasn't enough as Charlotte fell 101-96 at home. Win or lose, Dwight is simply crushing it for fantasy owners lately.

             Hornets owner Michael Jordan downplayed talk that he was shopping Walker, but admitted that he would ""listen to opportunities."" Walker is the main target for teams inquiring about Charlotte's players, of course, and Charlotte may be more willing to trade him if they can't string together some victories -- they're now 19-27 on the season, 5.0 games behind Philly for the No. 8 seed. If nothing else, Kemba has handled the rumors with aplomb. ""Im over it,"" he said. ""Im not even thinking about it anymore. I just want to win."" Fantasy owners should be hoping he stays put in Charlotte.

             The 2018 All-Star showed up in this game as the Pacers were able to get their lead up to 90-52 in the middle of the third quarter before the Suns made up ground in garbage time. Oladipo continues to run the offense and not having Darren Collison next to him may have helped his assists total a tad. Either way, Oladipo is shaping up to be a first-round value going forward.

            Thaddeus Young scored 22 points with three rebounds, three steals and two 3-pointers in 31 minutes against the Suns on Wednesday.
        
        
             It was his first 20-plus scoring game since Nov. 29 against the Rockets. Young's scoring has been a little underwhelming lately, but he's seen some decent run with 35.6 minutes per game over his last five. He does slightly benefit from Myles Turner (arm) being out because Turner does play next to Domantas Sabonis at times.

             New Orleans was coming off a double-overtime win powered by Boogie's historic line (44/24/10), with numbers not seen since Kareem Abdul-Jabbar in 1972. Cousins also had eight turnovers tonight, while making 5-of-10 FGs and 4-of-7 FTs, and New Orleans rode a relatively balanced effort to their seventh win in nine games.

             The Pelicans have now won seven of their last nine games, and their 26-21 record leaves them 1.0 game behind the Thunder for the No. 5 seed. They're leaning heavily on their starters, but have also received solid contributions from reserves like Cunningham, Darius Miller (eight points) and Jameer Nelson (eight points). If you're looking for fantasy value in the Pelicans' second unit, though, your waiver wire must be thoroughly picked-over.

            Joe Young made his first NBA start against the Suns on Wednesday, scoring six points with two rebounds, two assists, two steals and three turnovers in 34 minutes.
        
        
             He basically picked up all of Darren Collison's minutes with DC playing 34 minutes on Sunday. Young only played four minutes on Sunday, but coach Nate McMillan wanted to keep Cory Joseph and Lance Stephenson in the second unit. Unless we get news on Collison missing more time, Young is only a speculative add in very deep leagues.

             With Darren Collison (personal) out, coach Nate McMillan kept his second unit together, so Joseph only saw a seven-minute increase from his 25.8 minutes per game on the year. It's unclear if Collison will miss more time, so it's possible Joseph gets another bump in playing time on Friday.

             Somewhat surprisingly, he didn't really benefit today with Darren Collison not playing. Stephenson played 22 minutes on Sunday after he battled an illness last week. He's also struggled from the field lately at just 25.0 percent over his last five outings.

             Rondo opened the month with four straight games of double-digit scoring. In the seven games since then, however, he's averaging a paltry 4.8 points on 38.7% shooting, 2.3 boards, 4.7 dimes, 0.7 steals and 0.3 blocks. Without more assists and all-around production, it's getting harder to justify a roster spot in 12-team leagues.

             He had his second game of 15-plus points and 15-plus rebounds off the bench this season. Monroe saw some extra run with Alex Len (ankle) not playing and Tyson Chandler getting into some serious foul trouble. He could continue to see run with Len out because Len has had a number of ankle injuries over his NBA career. He's worth a speculative add if you need a big, but his fantasy value will likely go away once Len is ready to go.

             The game wasn't that close with the Suns making a late push in the fourth quarter, winning that frame 36-17. Booker continues to get more at the point guard and he came into this game with 6.3 assists per game over his previous January outings. He's also been lights out at the line lately, making all 36 attempts over his last five games. Booker didn't make the All-Star team this year, but he'll have a great chance to do so next season.

             The Suns playing from behind usually helps Daniels and that was the case again here. The more coach Jay Triano runs Devin Booker at the point, the more it should help Daniels get consistent playing time. He's been in the teens for scoring in four of is last five, averaging 14.2 points, 1.2 boards, 0.4 steals and 4.2 treys in that stretch. Daniels is a specialist in deeper leagues.

Marquese Chriss (hip, eye) could be getting closer to a return, which means Bender's increased opportunity could be going away.

While he is starting to trend up, Jackson is going to have a lot of ups and downs to finish his rookie season.

            Marcus Smart (hand laceration) will not play vs. the Clippers on Wednesday.
        
        
             Smart needed stitches after cutting himself on glass at the team hotel. Presumably this is just a day-to-day situation, but we'll know more soon. In his absence, expect Terry Rozier, Shane Larkin and Jaylen Brown to soak up extra minutes.

             He does not have a concussion, but the team wants to observe him to make sure he's OK. Horford took a shot to his head on Tuesday, so that is likely when the injury occurred. With him out, Aron Baynes should get the start at center while Daniel Theis backs him up.

             This comes as a surprise with Jordan being called doubtful to play earlier today. Jordan has been one of the most durable players in the NBA and he may not skip a beat in his return. Montrezl Harrell and Willie Reed will see their playing time take a hit here.

             He should be coming off the bench and will likely see some extra minutes to help fill the void left by Jimmy Butler (knee). Crawford doesn't really do much besides score, so he's not a great pickup unless it's as a specialist.

             He was doubtful to play all day and will now miss his third straight game for this knee soreness issue. It's been Nemanja Bjelica starting at small forward and he's coming off a strong Monday, so maybe he can keep it rolling. Although, Jamal Crawford returning could take minutes away from guys like Bjelica.

             Grant managed a -25 in plus-minutes over just 13 minutes, so clearly he had some trouble. This game is likely headed to garbage time, but there's little reason to add Nwaba based on this move.

             This looks to be a new injury for McCaw, who played just nine minutes against the Knicks on Tuesday. If he's out, Nick Young and Shaun Livingston may pick up a few extra minutes.

            Kobi Simmons will be on the active roster for Wednesday's game against the Spurs.
        
        
             Simmons has been out of the rotation over the past seven games, but with Tyreke Evans (illness) unavailable tonight, he should be able to get out there. He did have a nice game earlier in the year in which he scored 17 points to go with a full stat line in 30 minutes against Golden State, but aside from that one game, he hasn't done much. He's just a low-end streamer in deep leagues or a DFS punt play.

It's possible Simmons gets the start, so Chalmers can keep his usual role off the bench.

O'Quinn could also be on the trade block, so that may also help Hernangomez get some run in the near future. It's not a bad idea to add Willy in a competitive league.

             He did not play on Tuesday after tweaking his knee on Monday. The Knicks are finally starting to slide in the standings, so that could eventually cause Porzingis to miss more games. If he isn't going to play on Thursday, that would mean Michael Beasley gets some increased usage going his way.

He's not really worth deploying in DFS with Chandler active, but if you grabbed him when he started on Monday, you might as well throw him into your active lineups today.

There's a decent chance Len is going to miss multiple games with this injury, but the team calling it soreness could mean he only needs one game off to get right. It'll be Greg Monroe and Tyson Chandler getting the center minutes tonight.

            Pau Gasol is not on the injury report for Wednesday against the Grizzlies.
        
        
             He did not play on Tuesday after logging 30-plus minutes in his three previous games. LaMarcus Aldridge (rest) isn't suiting up for this game, so Gasol could have a shot at a double-double with minutes around 30 again.

With him out, Joffrey Lauvergne could see more minutes along with Davis Bertans, but it does sound like Pau Gasol (wrist) could be back for this one.

             This is great news for Johnson, whose ankle injury looked scary back on Jan. 15. Coach Erik Spoelstra may have a decision on his hands on who to start with Wayne Ellington looking good in the first unit. Ellington's minutes will certainly be dropping here while Derrick Jones Jr. and Justise Winslow should lose playing time, as well.

             The Heat finally look to have their backcourt back in the lineup. Dragic's bruised right knee kept him out for two games and he's had since Friday to get right again. The return of the Dragon and Johnson should take minutes from Justise Winslow, Wayne Ellington and Derrick Jones Jr.

             This is a great sign that Porter is going to be OK after suffering a hip strain. Although, Porter has battled a slew of upper-leg injuries, so the Wizards may opt to be careful. If he's out, Kelly Oubre would be a strong DFS play and should be owned in most leagues already.

He's been out of game action since Jan. 17, so he's had over a week off to get right.

Harris did a couple issues with his right foot earlier in his career, so this will be something to watch. If he can't go, Malik Beasley and Torrey Craig could see some additional minutes to help out Will Barton on the wing.

             He was not at Tuesday's practice during the session open to reporters and was said to be excused to deal with flu-like symptoms. The Grizzlies are shorthanded already and missing Evans would create an opportunity for Wayne Selden, Ben McLemore, Mario Chalmers and Dillion Brooks. Evans is likely going to be a game-time call, so we may not get much information before the 8:00 EST start time.

             The Suns hope that he's at the tail end of the recovery process for both the hip and eye issue, but they want him to get in a full practice or at least a hard workout before returning to the court. He won't play Wednesday, but if he can practice on Thursday, then perhaps he'll be able to get back out there for Friday's game vs. the Knicks. Dragan Bender will continue to start in his absence, but he hasn't played well over the past four with averages of 4.0 points and 6.0 boards on 33.3% shooting.

Marcus Georges-Hunt could be looking at minutes in the 20s tonight if Crawford is out, but that's still not quite enough floor time for him to make a meaningful impact in fantasy hoops.

Wednesday will be the first game of a back-to-back set, so with no practice time in between Wednesday and Thursday's games, it wouldn't be surprising to see Butler miss both of these.

             Jay Triano wants Chriss to get in a practice or hard workout before returning to the court, so until that happens, owners should plan on being without his services. Dragan Bender should earn another start tonight, but he's been fairly awful over the past four games, so he's not a great target in most leagues.

Smith has been flat out terrible lately and has acknowledged that he's not been ""playing up to his standards,"" so it wouldn't be terribly surprising to see Dwyane Wade replace him at the two-spot. Another option for Lue could be moving Tristan Thompson back into the starting five, with Kevin Love shuffling back to the four-spot and Jae Crowder heading to the second unit. Cleveland will practice on Thursday, so perhaps we'll get a hint of the changes that are coming at that point.

             The Knicks are currently in the playoff hunt, so management will need to decide if they want to make a serious run at the postseason and keep these guys, or give up their playoff hopes and move them for some younger players. New York is also reportedly considered bringing on some additional wing players at the deadline, something that would be a negative for Lee. Regardless of the name across the jersey, Thomas will remain a negligible asset in fantasy hoops.

            Courtney Lee is unconcerned regarding recent trade rumors that have involved him, saying, ""if I get traded, I get traded. If I'm here, I'm here. I'm happy either way.""
        
        
             ""Ive been in this league 10 years, been traded a couple times. Its nothing new,"" said Lee of hearing his name in the rumor mill. ""Only thing you can do is control what you can control, show up, be professional, do your work, go hard and leave it all out on the floor and whatever happens happens."" Lee is having a career-year as a starter in New York, but his value would likely take a significant hit if he was shipped off to a contender. Owners may want to consider selling high here.

Just want him to be more aggressive, not just in shooting but in terms of making plays, drawing people to him."" Through the month of January, Kennard has seen his minutes spike to 21.0 a night and he's responded with averages of 8.7 points, 1.1 triples, 2.9 boards and 1.3 assists per game on 54.7% shooting.

             ""Id say that the traveling looks like it could be early March as he can maybe do all of his rehab without an Alter-G machine and those types of things,"" head coach Brad Stevens said. ""Hes still got a long way to go."" Maybe Hayward will be able to get back out there for the playoffs, but it would be beyond shocking to see him take the court again during the regular season this year. He belongs on the waiver wire in all re-draft leagues.

             He once described himself as a ""walking bucket"" and looked the part tonight, hitting 8-of-15 shots and 5-of-5 free throws with four rebounds and four assists.

It's unclear if Porzingis will play on Thursday vs. the Nuggets or Friday vs. the Suns, but get ready to deploy Beasley in all formats if he can't go.

             This is not what his owners were expecting with Kristaps Porzingis (knee) out -- THJ's usage rate rises from 22.0 to 27.3 with KP off the floor. The big takeaway here is that THJ played 35 minutes even though he's supposed to have a 25-minute restriction during this road trip. He also played 29, 27 and 26 minutes in his previous three games, so hopefully this is an indication that his injury is completely behind him.

             He had 29 points and 10 dimes on Sunday and scored 33 points while flirting with a triple-double on Friday, but Kentavious Caldwell-Pope was out for both of those games. Lonzo Ball is still out with his knee injury, but KCP is back. Either way, Clarkson looks like a must-own, must-start fantasy player, at least until Ball is back in action.

             Kuzma basically won this one for the Lakers in his best game since he scored 31 points on Christmas Day. This was actually his first 20-point game in January, and while he's cooled off, he was playing well enough to still be owned and started in all fantasy leagues. He played just 10 minutes on Sunday (but still scored 15 points) after jamming his right index finger, but obviously, it's not a problem.

             He finished as a +3 in the 11-point loss and gave the Knicks a nice lift, hitting 3-of-4 shots and 2-of-2 free throws. He got an opportunity tonight with both Kristaps Porzingis (knee) and Kyle O'Quinn (calf) on the shelf, and while their status is unclear going forward, Hernangomez may get another chance to play during New York's upcoming back-to-back set on Thursday and Friday. He has some stash appeal even if you don't consider the injuries to Porzingis and KOQ, as the Knicks could be very active at the trade deadline.

             This was his second game in a row with single-digit points, the first time that's happened this season. This was also his second game without a triple since his 95-game streak with at least one 3-pointer ended on Jan. 12. Thompson still did well defensively and was a game-high +25 with four assists and two rebounds, and he should break out of this funk soon.

             The good news is that he played. The bad news is that he didn't do much and hurt some owners with the poor field goal percentage. He had missed his previous two games and came into this one averaging 13.3 points, 3.5 boards, 1.6 assists, 1.8 steals and 2.4 3-pointers on 50 percent shooting in January. He missed a couple big free throws tonight, but if the injury is behind him, he should be back in starting fantasy lineups. And in very un-tanking fashion, the Lakers have somehow won three straight games.

             He was a little iffy coming in with his tender ankle, but looked pretty healthy out there tonight. His shooting line was reminiscent of last season and he's in a funk right now, hitting just 6-of-24 shots over his last two games. He's still working his way back from the ankle injury, so expect his shooting numbers to increase as he gets healthy.

             He started on Sunday, but will usually come off the bench for Boston. He's actually playing well right now, averaging 14 points, 6.8 rebounds and 1.4 3-pointers over his last five games, making him worth a look in deeper fantasy leagues.

             He had 17 of his 32 points in the third quarter, and this was his 14th game of the season with 30+ points and third game with 8+ triples. Curry added seven assists and six rebounds with just a single turnover in 33 minutes, and it's nice to see him take better care of the ball after turning it over six times in each of his previous two games. He's been the second best player in standard 9-category leagues on a per-game basis and will look to keep his momentum going vs. the Wolves on Thursday.

             He missed a game-winning 3-pointer at the buzzer, but the Celtics only needed a two-pointer for a one-point win. He played great tonight, but he only had two points in 20 minutes on Sunday. He's been hot lately and started on Thursday when Kyrie Irving sat with a sore shoulder, but is too inconsistent to be started in most fantasy leagues on a regular basis.

             Irving banged his left knee on another player's in the second half and was seen grabbing it a few times, but stayed in the game and played through it. He's been bothered by a shoulder injury lately, but is hot, scoring 40 points on Sunday and scoring at least 20 points in his last five games. The shoulder issue seems to be subsiding, but owners may want to check back on Wednesday to make sure that the left knee isn't going to be a problem. Based on how he played after the injury tonight, it looks like he's fine. The Celtics have now lost four straight games after winning seven straight.

             Tatum has been struggling a bit for the Celtics, averaging just 10 points, 5.6 rebounds, 1.0 assists, 0.6 steals, 0.8 blocks and 1.2 3-pointers on 40 percent shooting over his last five games. He's still returning fifth-round fantasy value on the season though, and he's still a key component of what the Celtics will do down the stretch of the season.

             He took a shot to the face from the head of Josh Bell late in the game and went to the bench. He could be checked for a concussion, but then again, he might be fine.

             That's his fourth ejection of the season and 10th technical -- once he hits 16 he will get an automatic one-game suspension. KD vented some frustration to the officials before getting tossed, but there was only 2:50 remaining in the fourth quarter and the Warriors were up by 18 at the time. He finished 4-of-10 from the field and hit all four free throws, helping the Warriors bounce back from their loss to Houston on Saturday.

             Baby steps. Russell is still working off the rust, but finished as a +12 in the one-point loss. Russell said he's just trying to fit in as opposed to dominating until he gets his legs under him, so his owners will need to be patient. Coach Kenny Atkinson called that a ""sign of maturity"" and said Russ will be more aggressive when he's ready. ""I think hes trying to fit in with what were doing, and if he keeps that mindset, once he gets in better rhythm, hell be more aggressive,"" Atkinson said.

             Harris is only on the books for $1.5 million this season, so you better believe that GM Sean Marks is going to be getting lots of calls from contenders about him. He hit 7-of-10 shots and didn't miss a single 3-point attempt, adding one assist and one block. He might lose some value when D'Angelo Russell's workload increases, but he's still a solid 3-point specialist for the time being.

He's been focusing on his rebounding lately because he doesn't want to get embarrassed during film sessions, and so far it's working with 8+ boards in four out of his last five games.

             ""(Parker) is still going to be an important part of what we do,"" coach Gregg Popovich said on Tuesday. ""But Dejounte is a young talent and we need to find out exactly what we have there. So it is time."" Murray was right on time with a monster line tonight, and while Parker and Patty Mills will still shine from time to time, Murray is the guy you want to own in fantasy right now. Go get him.

             That's not a bad way to celebrate being named to his seventh All-Star game. The Nets have allowed the third most fantasy points to PGs this season, so this was the perfect storm for Russ. He hit 12-of-27 shots and 8-of-11 free throws, adding six assists, five rebounds, two steals and one turnover. His Thunder are rolling with five straight wins and they will look to make it six on Thursday vs. the Wizards.

             Anderson guarded LeBron James for much of the night and had his fourth double-double of the season. He's played really well in his last three games, averaging 8.3 points, 10.3 boards, 3.7 assists, 2.7 steals, 2.3 blocks and 1.0 3-pointers over that stretch. And with Kawhi Leonard out until further notice, and with Anderson's confidence soaring, he should be one of the hottest pickups in fantasy hoops right now.

             Bertans has been unreliable this season and isn't worth owning, but on nights when he's starting for the Spurs, he's worth a look as a DFS punt. He came through tonight if you used him.

             Pau Gasol (wrist) was out tonight and Aldridge took advantage of the extra touches and played a highly efficient game. He's scored at least 30 points eight times this season and was returning early third-round fantasy value coming into this game. And with Kawhi Leonard down and out for the Spurs, Aldridge should be the first option until further notice. He's turned out to be one of the fantasy draft steals of the year.

             Thomas struggled during Dejounte Murray's coming out party and is still trying to shake off the rust after missing the first couple months of the season with his hip injury. He's played fairly well since returning and has scored between 14 and 24 points over his last four games. But he doesn't look like the player America fell in love with in Boston last year. He's got time to get it turned around and the Cavaliers, who are 3-7 in January, clearly need for that to happen.

             LeBron played well, but Kevin Love was rather quiet and Isaiah Thomas is still clearly trying to shake off the rust after missing the first couple months of the season with his hip injury. James is still a fantasy monster and sits as the No. 5 player in nine-cat this season. But his teammates aren't giving him much help, which is fine in fantasy, but not working in reality.

             Apparently the message the team reportedly sent to Love on Monday was not received. The reeling Cavs have lost two straight, six of their last seven and are 3-7 in January. They still have the potential to flip the switch and turn it around, but things are not going well in Cleveland right now. Love may not be feeling well, but he had no choice but to be out there trying his best tonight. And LaMarcus Aldridge and Dejounte Murray dominated them in the win. Tyronn Lue said after the game that a lineup change is coming, but it's hard to imagine Love not being a starter for the Cavs.

             The Kings snapped an eight-game losing streak tonight and Hield should continue to get plenty of run the rest of the way, especially with so many guards (De'Aaron Fox, Frank Mason) banged up for the Kings. They're going with a youth movement, so George Hill was rested tonight and Fox got hurt, opening up the gate for both Hield and Garrett Temple to play well. Hield's a decent add right now for the banged up Kings, despite an inconsistent season

             De'Aaron Fox went down with abdominal tightness and didn't return after just 11 minutes, and Temple was really the only option left at point guard for the Kings, as George Hill was rested and Frank Mason and Fox were hurt. Temple didn't even play on Monday (because he's a veteran) and hadn't scored more than 16 points in a game since prior to Christmas. Tonight was his night, but it's hard to see him being a hot pickup unless Fox is going to miss multiple games with his injury. Temple has just eight 20-point games over his seven-year career.

             We wish he'd gotten more minutes, but he did a lot with his limited run tonight. Labissiere was coming off a season-high 23 points on Monday and was a little iffy tonight with a shoulder injury. He played through it and should be picked up in fantasy leagues right now, especially if the Kings are going to showcase him for a potential trade. He's been highly inconsistent all year, but the Kings are going with their youth and Labissiere should be a big part of that going forward.

            Jarell Martin (left knee and left ankle) is questionable for Wednesday's game vs. the Spurs.
        
        
             Martin was on the injury report with a left hand injury earlier this week, but now he has a couple more issues to deal with. He's been a pleasant surprise lately with 11.4 points, 5.6 rebounds, 0.8 blocks, 0.6 steals and 1.0 triples in 28.0 minutes over his last five games, and he's taking advantage of his opportunity with JaMychal Green (ankle) banged up. If Martin can't go, the Grizzlies may take an extended look at Myke Henry.

             One of Payton's best games of the season was wasted on a loss to the Kings in Orlando, but his fantasy owners don't care. Payton has been incredibly consistent lately, hitting 9-of-14 shots tonight, 9-of-16 on Sunday, 9-of-17 on Thursday and 9-of-12 shots on Jan. 12. That all translates to him averaging 19 points, 5.2 rebounds, 5.6 assists and 1.6 steals on fantastic 61 percent shooting over his last five, which includes a six-point dud on Jan. 16. He's a must-start player right now in all formats.

             This is his fourth straight game on the shelf and he remains without a timetable to return. Dillon Brooks has been the best pickup in Ennis' absence, but he has cooled off lately. There should be a better option on your waiver wire.

             He somehow failed to record a single rebound in Sunday's win over Boston, and while he didn't have a monster night against the Kings, it's hard to be mad at him for six boards, three dimes and four swats.

             Gordon's overall line wasn't too shabby, but his shot selection has been really bad and the turnovers were atrocious. His shot selection has been poor, at best, for most of January and he entered tonight's game at just 34 percent for the month. If he'd stop taking wild shots and focus on becoming an efficient player, it probably wouldn't take much to fix what is broken. The good news is that he's double-doubled in four of his last five games, but hit just 27-of-86 shots (31%) in them. The reality is he's like a gunslinger in the Wild West out there right now, but maybe things will get better in February.

             Fox was the only true PG on the active roster, so Garrett Temple started the second half and we should see  Bogdan Bogdanovic handle the ball a little more while Fox is out. Hopefully this isn't a serious injury and Fox can be cleared in time for Thursday's game vs. the Heat. He finished with seven points in 11 minutes.

             On Monday, coach Doc Rivers said that Jordan was ""really close"" to returning. Thus, there was some hope he'd be back on the floor on Wednesday. Still, this is only a game-notes designation, so we'll take it with a grain of salt. We should have another update after the Clippers shootaround Wednesday morning. Montrezl Harrell and Willie Reed will again divvy up minutes at center if Jordan is unable to play. Harrell had 23 points and six rebounds in 31 minutes on Monday.

             Frye is rumored to be involved in a possible deal for George Hill. Thus, Frye sitting out Tuesday likely has more to do with a potential trade than an abdominal injury. Regardless, it doesn't have much of a fantasy impact, as Frye is not a regular part of the Cavs rotation.

             Jalen Rose said that his sources have been telling him that Leonard has been upset with the Spurs inability to bring in ""elite-level talent"" during free agency (LaMarcus Aldridge?) and that there's a belief out there that players don't want to play for Gregg Popovich, because Popovich requires you to work hard or something. There does appear to be tension brewing between Leonard and the Spurs, but we're skeptical of Rose's assertion that he wants to be traded. Remember, Aldridge was at an impasse with Spurs' management this summer, but they managed to work things out.

The Kings would reportedly buy out Frye contract after the trade, after which, he'd be free to join a team of his choosing. Frye should be able to attract offers from playoff teams, but it's tough to see him landing in a situation where he'd have fantasy value.

            Rodney Hood (leg) is listed as questionable for Wednesday's game vs. Detroit.
        
        
             Hood has missed each of Utah's previous two contests. We should get an update on his status after Wednesday morning's shootaround. If Hood is unable to play, Joe Ingles, Joe Johnson and Alec Burks would soak up additional minutes.

            The Cavs and Kings remain engaged in a deal that would send George Hill to Cleveland, according to sources of Adrian Wojnarowski of ESPN.
        
        
             Iman Shumpert and Channing Frye have been the primary players involved on Cleveland's side of the conversation, but with 15 players already on the roster in Sacramento, they'd need to include someone else to make the deal work. While a move away from Sacramento would help Hill's rest-of-season potential, going to Cleveland's backcourt where he'd fight for minutes with the likes of Isaiah Thomas and Dwyane Wade isn't exactly ideal either.

             ""Hes remarkably quick off the floor and he does surprise guys [with his shot-blocking abilities],"" said Vogel. ""He continues to prove himself and well continue to use him. Hes like a robot and hes unfazed by all of that [surrounding noise] and he just goes out and plays."" Birch was out there for the entirety of the fourth quarter during Sunday's win over the Celtics, and it looks like he's earned a spot in the rotation. He's averaged 2.3 swats per game over the past three, so he's on the radar as a deep league shot-blocking specialist.

Kyle O'Quinn (calf) will be joining Porzingis on the sidelines tonight, leaving the Knicks very thin upfront. Lance Thomas could move back into the starting five tonight, but the most attractive DFS targets will be Michael Beasley, Enes Kanter and Tim Hardaway Jr.

             This will be Ball's fifth straight game on the sidelines, and considering he's still not been able to practice, we're going to have to consider him doubtful for Friday's game in Chicago. With Ball unavailable, Tyler Ennis will have another opportunity to start with Jordan Clarkson and Alex Caruso logging extended minutes with the second unit. Clarkson is the most attractive fantasy option out of this group.

            Glenn Robinson III (left ankle) practiced with the team on Tuesday for the first time since September, but coach Nate McMillan said he is ""still a ways away.""
        
        
             Robinson told reporters earlier this month that he was hoping to return before the All-Star break, but McMillan said on Tuesday that there was only a ""small chance"" that happens. GRIII will be eased back into action once he is cleared to play, and will likely be on a minutes restriction. He should be left on waivers in all standard leagues.

             Turner, who has missed seven straight games, told reporters that he has made ""good progress"" and was able to ""put in a full day of practice"" on Tuesday but was unsure if he would be cleared to play Wednesday night. We should have another update on Turner's status following Wednesday morning's shootaround. Turner will reportedly come off the bench behind Domantas Sabonis if he does play Wednesday.

Listed as probable, he is expected to suit up on Tuesday in hopes of carrying the momentum forward.

We should have confirmation, one way or the other, at approximately 5:30 pm EST, when coach Dave Joerger addressed the media pregame.

             Joakim Noah is essentially untradeable due to his burdensome contract. However, both Willy Hernangomez and Kyle O'Quinn have team-friendly deals.

Teams are eager to poach him in they feel the Knicks are undervaluing him. Any trade would boost Willy's fantasy value, as he would see an increase in playing time elsewhere.

            Adrian Wojnarowski of ESPN is reporting that, during a tense team meeting on Monday,  several players challenged the legitimacy of Kevin Love's illness that led him to leave Saturday's game early.
        
        
             Love only played three minutes in Saturday's embarrassing loss to the Thunder and apparently left the arena early, irking his teammates. Love also did not practice with the team on Sunday. However, it sounds like Love was able to explain himself to his teammates, which calmed things down. The Cavs are dealing with a host of issues, including uninspired defense, which has resulted in them losing nine of their last 12 games. On Monday, Love said he felt better and plans on playing Tuesday vs. the Spurs.

            Damian Lillard recently met with Blazers owner Paul Allen to ""gather an understanding of the organization's direction,"" according to Chris Hayes of ESPN.
        
        
             Lillard and Allen met for approximately one hour in Allen's office last Thursday. Per the ESPN report, Allen feared that Lillard might demand a trade, but no such request was made. However, Lillard let it be known that he ""has championship aspirations and wanted to fulfill those lofty goals during the remaining years of his prime window."" With plenty of drama throughout the NBA, this is another storyline to keep an eye on.

He helped the Clippers limit Karl-Anthony Towns to 1-of-7 shooting, and he's been way more effective than Willie Reed in the absence of DeAndre Jordan (ankle). Coach Doc Rivers said before the game that he thought Jordan would be back by now and added that he's close, so Harrell's window for fantasy value is closing.

             That's his second triple-double of the season and the seventh of his career. Griffin hit 13-of-22 shots and 4-of-7 free throws, but turned the ball over four times including one really bad one with the Clippers down three points in the final 20 seconds. He's been a monster lately with 23.4 points, 9.2 rebounds, 6.8 assists, 0.8 steals and 1.4 triples over his last five games, and his outlook will be fine as long as the Clippers continue to fight for the No. 8 seed out West.

             He made his second straight start for the injured Jimmy Butler (knee), but unlike last game, he closed over Marcus George-Hunt. Bjelica grabbed nine rebounds with four assists, one steal and three triples in 34 minutes, and he's now averaging 13.0 points, 7.5 rebounds, 2.0 assists, 1.5 steals and 2.0 triples in his last two games. If Butler continues to miss time, Bjelica will be a solid streaming option on Wednesday vs. the Blazers and Thursday vs. the Warriors.

             The 16 free throws were three more than his previous career-high, but Teague wasn't done there, as he racked up six assists with three rebounds and a turnover in 34 minutes. He was in a funk coming into tonight's game with averages of 11.0 points, 6.3 assists, 1.7 steals and 0.7 triples on 36.8% shooting in his previous six games, and while he obviously benefitted from Jimmy Butler's (knee) absence, hopefully this a sign of things to come.

             This was his first game in Denver since he was traded, and it's no secret that he had an issue with coach Mike Malone when he was there -- when asked about their relationship at the morning shootaround, Nurkic plainly said they didn't have one. ""He plays better when he has an edge,"" Damian Lillard said of Nurkic. ""For Nurk, when hes locked in, hes focused, when hes paying attention to the small things, too, instead of the things that jump out, thats when you see the best version of him."" He averaged 20.0 points and 7.0 rebounds on 57.5 percent shooting in three previous meetings, so it's easy to see why he was such a popular DFS target tonight.

             It was a virtuoso performance from one of the league's best point guards. Murray hit mid-range jumpers and six shots in the paint to get him to his best scoring game ever. Murray has been on a serious roll for two months, so his patient owners are laughing to the bank.

            Will Barton missed all seven of his shots from the field against the Blazers on Monday, but hit 7-of-8 from the line for seven points.
        
        
             Barton got the start at small forward over Wilson Chandler, and while it may have been a matchup move, it's possible coach Malone gave him the start since he was playing against his former team (he did the same thing with Mason Plumlee). Despite the rough shooting line, Malone let Barton close this game and he was able to grab eight rebounds with two assists and a steal in 34 minutes. His splits as a starter are significantly higher, so his fantasy owners will be hoping that he makes another start vs. the Knicks on Thursday.

He's returning seventh-round fantasy value over his last 10 games, and fifth-round value over his last five. Hopefully he's setting up for a big second half of the season.

             Coach Mike Malone has been changing his starting lineup a lot lately depending on the matchups, but Plumlee got the nod over Trey Lyles against his former team. You could argue that this was just his second strong game in the last two weeks, so he's hard to rely on in a standard league, starting or not. The Nuggets play the Knicks on Thursday and they use a traditional two-big lineup, so maybe Plumlee gets another start.

             The bench wasn't much better and the Wizards hit just 31 percent of their shots in the blowout loss. Hopefully shots are falling against the Thunder on Thursday, and hopefully Wall's migraine is a distant memory by then. He was iffy coming in because of it, but was able to play. And the migraine likely explains at least part of the poor performance for Wall and his teammates tonight.

             Otto Porter went down with a hip injury tonight and didn't return. Meanwhile, Oubre had scored at least 10 points in his previous seven games and should get a boost if Porter's going to miss time. Even with a few duds thrown in, Porter came into this one averaging 14 points, 4.1 rebounds and 2.2 3-pointers on 55 percent shooting in January. He could be a sneaky pickup if Porter's going to miss time with his injury, assuming he's not already owned in your league.

             The Mavericks usually get destroyed by opposing centers, but Gortat couldn't make shots and played just 18 minutes. And if he can't get it done against Dallas, he's going to have trouble getting it done against anyone. He's had a rough season and hasn't played more than 20 minutes in any of his last three games. He's barely hanging onto fantasy value right now and is only owned because starting centers are so tough to come by.

             This was one of his most active games on the defensive end this season, and while Chandler has been vocal in the past about not wanting to come off the bench, this was probably a temporary move -- the Nuggets may have started Will Barton so he could have some revenge on his former team. Chandler hasn't scored more than six points in five straight games, so he's not a standard-league asset.

             Davis' minutes have been out of control, as he's played at least 38 of them in six straight games, so maybe the foul out was a unintentional gift. He looked great again tonight and the heavy minutes have yet to take a toll on the big man, but we're hoping the Pelicans can start keeping him at least under 40 per game soon. He's too injury prone to play such heavy minutes for much longer, at least as far as his fantasy owners should be concerned.

             Boogie Nights! Cousins became the first player since Wilt Chamberlain in 1968 to post a 40-20-10 game and he even managed to avoid fouling out, despite all the minutes. The points and boards were both season highs and this was his second triple-double of the season, as he had 29 points, 12 boards and 10 assists back on Oct. 28. Cousins came in as the No. 10 fantasy player in nine-cat leagues and he's probably going to jump a few spots after this historic performance.

            Jerian Grant hit 6-of-7 shots, 2-of-2 3-pointers and 8-of-8 free throws on his way to 22 points, five rebounds, a career-high 13 assists, two steals, a block and six turnovers in 47 minutes of Monday's 132-128 overtime loss to the Pelicans.
        
        
             Kris Dunn is out with a concussion and Grant went nuts tonight. Believe it or not, the 22 points were not a season high, but it was close. Dunn's very iffy for the rest of the week and after tonight, Grant can be deployed in DFS or even season-long leagues for as long as Dunn is out. Just keep in mind that he'd really been struggling to score, putting up no more than eight points in all but one of his January games.

             He was listed on the injury report with a left hand injury, but the Grizzlies didn't update his status prior to tip-off -- that may be an indication that his status wasn't in danger. He played with a ton of energy tonight and has been a nice source of low-end value for the past week, averaging 11.4 points, 5.6 rebounds, 0.8 blocks, 0.6 steals and 1.0 triples in 28.0 minutes over his last five games. As long as JaMychal Green (ankle) continues to sit, Martin will be relevant.

             The 25-year-old rookie signed a two-way contract back on Jan. 13 and impressed in his second game with the Grizzlies -- he finished scoreless in 14 minutes in his debut. He had nine points alone in the fourth quarter and helped the Grizzlies come back from a 15-point deficit. Henry is getting an opportunity while JaMychal Green (ankle) is out, but unless he does this again, Jarell Martin will continue to be the better short-term asset.

             He tied his season high in scoring tonight, but didn't do a lot more than make shots and turnovers (he had five of them). Lopez has been scoring, hitting double digits in six straight games, but hasn't had more than seven rebounds and two blocks in any of his January games. He's nothing more than a low-end fantasy center, but that could change if he stays hot, or starts rebounding and blocking.

Unless he leapfrogs Andrew Harrison or Wayne Selden on the depth chart, he belongs on the wire in most leagues.

             Markkanen missed all four of his 3-pointers but still had a really nice night. Bobby Portis played just 15 minutes and had eight points and seven rebounds, and if Nikola Mirotic is traded, Portis is still going to have to compete with Markkanen for playing time. Markkanen has been especially hot lately, checking in as the No. 15 fantasy player over his previous five games.

The 76ers were on the verge of a four-game winning streak, but coughed up a 15-point lead and were outscored 31-18 in the fourth quarter. Embiid also missed a few free throws down the stretch, so he's not going to be happy with himself. He'll look to get his team back on track vs. the Bulls on Wednesday.

             Wow. He was on fire tonight and has been playing extremely well in January after a slow start to the season. He missed Saturday's game for personal reasons, but was back in full force and effect tonight. Jason Kidd is out for the Bucks and Brogdon had the best game of his career in his first game without him. Hopefully this is a sign of things to come from Brogdon the rest of the way, although it won't be easy for him to match it once Giannis Antetokounmpo is back from his knee injury.

             He filled up the boxscore, but didn't do it efficiently, hitting 5-of-14 shots and 4-of-5 free throws with three turnovers. He also made a terrible decision down the stretch, as he jacked up a wild 3-pointer with nine seconds left even though Philly was down by two points at the time. He was shooting 38.6% from the field in January prior to tonight and his shot hasn't looked the same since the first couple months of the season, but he'll continue to log heavy minutes for Philly because of his defense. Once his shot starts falling, he'll be an elite fantasy asset again.

             TLC played 30 minutes for the second game in a row, hitting six triples with two assists and a block.

             He didn't block a shot and the TOs were a buzzkill, but he was great. If you used him in DFS, you fared well, but he's still a risky season-long pickup, given how the Suns have been so weird with their centers all season. But if this move to the starting unit becomes permanent, Monroe will be worth grabbing in all formats.

            Dragan Bender played 28 minutes and hit 3-of-4 shots and a 3-pointer, but finished with just seven points, three rebounds and two assists in Monday's loss to the Bucks.
        
        
             Bender is getting about 30 minutes a night, but hasn't scored more than seven points in his last four games, which includes a goose egg on Jan. 7, when he was 0-for-7 and didn't score a point. He was at least rebounding the ball fairly well, but didn't even do that tonight. He should be flourishing with Marquese Chriss (hip) out, but he just can't get it going, mainly because the Suns don't appear to be running any plays for him. He could get hot at any time with Chriss out indefinitely, but it's been a rough ride thus far.

            Gerald Green was eligible to play on Monday after serving his two-game suspension, but never got off the bench.
        
        
             Green kind of killed it when James Harden was hurt, but with Trevor Ariza, Harden and Eric Gordon all in action, he may have trouble finding minutes going forward. If you want to drop him for a hot free agent (Kelly Oubre?), feel free to do so. Oubre's not doing much tonight for the Wizards, but has been hot and Otto Porter left with an injury on Monday.

             He was 2-of-5 from the free throw line, but also hit 6-of-10 shots against Hassan Whiteside, who had a big night against Capela. Look for Capela to put up some big numbers against the Mavs on Wednesday, as Dallas hasn't been able to stop opposing centers all season long.

             Ariza served a two-game suspension for entering the Clippers locker room recently and was playing pretty well before the suspension. Look for him to bounce back against the Mavericks on Wednesday.

             Harden's been back for three games since missing seven with a hamstring injury and has seen his scoring improve in all of them. The minutes are back and so is Harden, and owners just have to hope he can stay healthy the rest of the way. Oddly, he hasn't been getting to the line since his return, shooting just nine free throws in his three games. That should change quickly and might be a sign that he's still not 100 percent confident in his hamstring.

             He filled the stat sheet, although it was with small numbers. And with both Goran Dragic and Tyler Johnson out with injuries, we were expecting more.

            Otto Porter has been diagnosed with a right hip strain and will not return to Monday's game vs. Dallas.
        
        
             This is the same hip that's been bothering him for a long time, so this is a concern. His night finished with four points (2-of-8 FGs), six rebounds, one block and two steals. The Wizards do have a couple days off before taking on the Thunder on Thursday, but we'll consider him questionable for that contest. If does miss time, Kelly Oubre is the obvious pickup.

             Whiteside was good and bad tonight, but he's been rolling, scoring at least 22 points in three of his last four games, with double-doubles in all four of them. He hasn't blocked a shot in two straight games, but is still averaging 2.4 blocks over his last five, which means more of them are coming. The turnovers were not typical, either, as he hadn't committed more than four of them in any of his other January games.

             He started the fourth quarter, but he had a two-minute break from 8:15 to 6:04. Interestingly, Walker has only played a 12-minute fourth once this season after he played that quarter 13 times in 2015-16, and nine times in 2016-17. He's reportedly on the trade block, but his fantasy owners should be rooting for him to stay put.

             He was very aggressive on the offensive end and his energy gave the team a big boost -- he was second on the team with a plus-five in plus-minus. With the Kings going to a youth movement, Labissiere should be seeing minutes every night and he does have some upside because they do want to get him going. He should be owned.

General manager Rich Cho can probably destroy any front-office person in ping-pong, but he has his hands full to turn his team around.

            John Collins played 21 minutes off the bench and hit 3-of-4 shots, his second 3-pointer of the season, and 1-of-1 free throws for eight points, seven rebounds and a block in Monday's 104-90 win over the Jazz.
        
        
             Collins has seen at least 21 minutes in four straight games and the production should follow the boost in minutes. Expect his minutes to keep climbing as the season winds down, as the Hawks have no reason not to start giving him more run.

            Taurean Prince finally got it going again on Monday with 17 points, one rebound, three assists, three steals and two 3-pointers on 6-of-11 shooting in 25 minutes.
        
        
             Prince hadn't scored more than seven points in his previous four games, so it was really nice to see him back at it tonight. His finger injury should be a thing of the past and the Hawks have no reason not to keep running Prince out there. If he was dropped in your league, he's going to be a hot pickup tonight. Hopefully he can keep it going against the Raptors on Wednesday.

            De'Aaron Fox scored 16 points during a 112-107 loss to the Hornets on Monday, adding three rebounds, seven assists, one steal and one 3-pointer in 31 minutes.
        
        
             The minutes have been there for Fox with 32.2 per game over his last five. He still hasn't really been productive in that time, averaging 13.4 points, 2.0 assists, 6.4 assists, 0.8 steals, 0.4 blocks and 0.8 treys on 38.6 percent from the field in those five games -- they lost them all, too. He's certainly worth owning, but he needs to up his efficiency and/or steals to flirt with mid-round value.

            Ricky Rubio hit just 1-of-8 shots for two points, four rebounds, six assists, a steal and four turnovers in Monday's 104-90 loss to the Hawks.
        
        
             Rubio's poor shooting and low scoring would be an easier pill to swallow if he was racking up a ton of assists and steals, but as a whole package, he's been nothing more than a headache for most of the season. He's averaging just 8.4 points, 4.2 rebounds, 4.8 assists, 1.8 steals and is shooting just 29 percent over his last five games. And if you throw out Friday's 6-of-11 shooting night, he's just 7-of-34 (21%) over his last four. He still has a chance to have a big second half, but if it happens, it will be somewhat surprising based on how the first half of his season has gone.

             He's been back from his knee injury for three games and has seen his scoring slip in each of them, but he helped make up for the lack of offense tonight with the steals, blocks and boards, and it's just nice to see him back on the court. He'll matchup against Andre Drummond on Wednesday when he'll look to break out of his scoring funk.

             He looked pretty comfortable in his catch-and-shoot role off the bench, so coach Dave Joerger may keep him there. Hield did also get minutes to close this game out and he's seen 25-plus minutes in four straight since the coach announced the youth movement. Hield will be inconsistent, but he's probably worth owning in 12-team leagues.

             The Bucks will likely be evaluating him for a possible concussion at halftime. If he can't return, the Bucks will use a committee approach to soak up his minutes with guys like Sterling Brown benefitting.

             The Clippers just can't catch a break. This doesn't mean too much with Lou Williams and Milos Teodosic healthy, but we may see more of Tyrone Wallace with Evans out. Evans belongs on the wire in most leagues, but keep an eye on him if the Clippers blow it up at the trade deadline.

             He was a full participant in Monday's practice and coach Steve Kerr said he looked ""fine,"" so expect to see him play vs. the Knicks. He's hard to trust in fantasy unless the Warriors rest a stud or two, and his outlook isn't great because they will rest him a ton.

             Revenge game? Barton goes against his former team and Chandler has been whisper quiet, but moving Barton into the first unit makes a lot of sense here. This could stick with coach Mike Malone really unsatisfied with his first unit, so maybe Barton trends up a bit. Chandler loses value here in his first game off the bench.

             The Plumlee and Nikola Jokic combination hasn't really worked this season, so it's puzzling that coach Mike Malone keeps going back to it, especially with the Blazers starting Al-Farouq Aminu at the four.  Regardless of where he begins the game, Plumlee is a low-end fantasy option while Jokic is active.

Brooks was getting hot before this illness with a career-high 22 points on Friday and an 10-point outing on Saturday. He doesn't do much outside of scoring so he's only a borderline hold in 12-team leagues.

This is a position battle to watch, but Harrison is nothing more than a deep-league fantasy asset that has been trending down for weeks.

             Wall missed the morning shootaround, but it didn't sound like his status was in doubt. Maybe coach Scott Brooks just wants him to go through warmups first, but DFS owners will have to be careful here. If wall can't go, Tim Frazier and Tomas Satoransky will benefit, while Bradley Beal will see a bump in usage.

With Gasol unavailable, it'll likely be either Davis Bertans or Joffrey Lauvergne entering the starting lineup with LaMarcus Aldridge being forced into heavy minutes. Ginobili's absence will translate to more run for Brandon Paul and Bryn Forbes.

             Revenge game!? Jay Triano said he's making the move because Monroe has ""been a good soldier"" while collecting DNP-CDs, and he wants to reward him with a start against his former team. He also said that Chandler has been a bit ""fatigued,"" so it wouldn't be surprising to see Tyson rested on Monday. Monroe has played well when given the minutes, so he'll make for an enticing DFS target tonight under the revenge game narrative.

While Graham figures to see some extended run as a starter, Jeremy Lamb still makes for the better target as he could be looking at minutes in the 30s tonight. Head coach Steve Clifford also hinted that Malik Monk could see some more floor time tonight, but it's tough to see him earning playing time in the 20s with the rest of the wings in Charlotte healthy.

             Bucks assistant coach Joe Prunty will fill in as the interim head coach while Milwaukee looks for Kidd's long-term replacement, and it'll be interesting to see if he alters the rotations. Milwaukee management reportedly decided to make the move after the Bucks fell to the No. 8 seed out East, and there had been discontent brewing between both parties for a couple years now. Kidd's constantly changing rotations were a nightmare, so perhaps his departure will bring some stability.

            The Trail Blazers have reportedly engaged with the Clippers in trade talks regarding DeAndre Jordan.
        
        
             Portland, Milwaukee and Cleveland have all reached out to Los Angeles regarding Jordan's availability, but thus far, the Clippers have not received a proposal that they find ""seriously tempting,"" according to sources of Marc Stein of the New York Times. Jordan could be one of the biggest names moved at the deadline, although with the Clippers currently sitting on the No. 8 seed out West, there's less incentive to move him.

             Triano isn't going to reveal his starters until closer to tip-off and didn't hint at anything either. Devin Booker and T.J. Warren are the only starters that should be locked in, so Tyler Ulis, Dragan Bender and Tyson Chandler could be looking at new roles tonight. Stay tuned.

With Johnson out, we should see plenty of Wayne Ellington tonight and he's coming off a monster 26-point game. Josh Richardson gets an obvious bump as well, especially since Goran Dragic (knee) is also out.

             Dragic has a bruised right knee and will miss his second straight game. This is likely a pain tolerance issue, so we'll continue to list him as day-to-day. With both Dragic and Johnson out, Josh Richardson and James Johnson will handle the ball a ton, while Wayne Ellington will get a nice bump and is coming off a 26-point game. All three are excellent fantasy options.

             We still don't have many details, and the Wolves are simply calling the issue a sore right knee. With Butler out for a second straight game, the Wolves may turn to Nemanja Bjelica again -- he started in Butler's place vs. the Raptors and had eight points, six rebounds, two steals and one triple in 26 minutes. Andrew Wiggins dropped 29 points on 21 shots in his last game, so look for him to step up again. Looking ahead, the Wolves play again on Wednesday vs. the Blazers and Thursday vs. the Warriors.

             According to the report, ""Months of discord centering on elements of treatment, rehabilitation and timetables for return from a right quadriceps injury have had a chilling impact"" on Leonard's relationship with the front office and coaching staff. Wojnarowski adds that ""there is work to be done to repair what has been until now a successful partnership,"" so the Spurs find themselves in rare territory for a franchise that is considered to be one of the best in all of sports. Spurs GM RC Buford has refuted these claims, but did add that this process has been ""difficult for everyone.""

            Trevor Ariza has served his 2-game suspension and will be back in the lineup on Monday vs. the Heat.
        
        
             He's off to a cold start in January with averages of 11.9 points, 5.3 rebounds, 1.7 assists, 1.6 steals and 2.9 triples on 36.0% shooting, but he's worth holding onto during this slump as he can be a fantasy stud when his shot is falling. With Ariza back, Luc Mbah a Moute and P.J. Tucker lose quite a bit of value.

             Now that James Harden is healthy, Green is going to have a limited role off the Houston bench. His window for reliable fantasy value has likely closed, but he could still be a 3-point specialist for deep-league owners.

             This is his second game in a row on the shelf and it's not a great sign that he's getting ruled out this early. For now, consider him questionable for Wednesday's game vs. the Pistons. Joe Ingles is coming off a 21-point game vs. the Clippers, and guys like Joe Johnson and Alec Burks will get a small bump in value off the bench with Hood out.

Ball is doubtful for Tuesday's home game vs. Boston, and then the Lakers go on the road to face the Bulls, Raptors, Magic, Nets and Thunder. Jordan Clarkson has emerged as the best fantasy pickup in Ball's absence, while Alex Caruso has outplayed Tyler Ennis and could also have some nice value in the short term.

             Murray finished with eight points, seven rebounds, four assists, three steals and one block in 28 minutes, but the biggest news came after the game. Parker told reporters that Gregg Popovich ""thought it was time"" he yield the starting job, and Parker didn't object. Murray started 14 games prior to Sunday, averaging 8.9 points, 7.1 rebounds, 3.6 assists, 1.1 steals, 0.3 blocks and 2.4 turnovers. He's not a 3-point shooter and struggles with percentages, and the starting gig isn't a guarantee of big minutes in San Antonio, but he's a decent pickup while we see how he fares.

             The Spurs' home record dropped to 19-3 but that's still the best in the NBA. Green is slumping offensively at 6-of-23 in his past three games (26.1 percent), and he didn't have any defensive stats to salvage the line in 8-cat/9-cat. The opportunity is there without Kawhi Leonard (quad), though, so he's a decent hold if you're not in a points-based league.

Dejounte Murray took his spot and Gregg Popovich would only say ""we'll see"" when asked if the move would last longer than one game. The Spurs may have simply wanted more playmaking into the second unit with Manu Ginobili (thigh) and Rudy Gay (heel) out again, but we'll find out when they face the Cavs on Tuesday. Either way, this doesn't change Parker's fantasy value very much since the key is him staying on the court and avoiding DNP-CDs.

            Darren Collison had 15 points, four assists, three steals, two rebounds and one 3-pointer in 34 minutes on Sunday, without any turnover in 34 minutes.
        
        
             The Pacers concluded their five-game road trip with a win in San Antonio, and Collison's game was a nice bounce-back after he shot 1-of-9 in L.A. on Friday. Indiana heads home with the No. 6 seed -- the Sixers, Bucks and Pistons are all within two games, and the playoff race in the East is setting up to be very interesting. Collison has been a big part of Indiana's success and he's quietly crushing draft-day expectations as a top-50 value.

             Young isn't a good free-throw shooter (67.7% for his career) but he's found a way to avoid that problem -- just don't shoot them. The veteran is averaging a career-low 0.8 free-throw attempts per game this season, and has just four attempts in his past 15 games. He's been a steady mid-round value over the past few weeks.

             Myles Turner (elbow) will be re-evaluated in Indiana on Monday, so we should have an update very soon. He's missed seven straight games, during which time Sabonis has averaged 11.7 points and 10.1 rebounds, with a modest 1.9 assist, 0.6 blocks and 0.3 steals. A lack of defensive stats is limiting his roto value, but he's still a solid big man to own even when Turner is healthy.

             Johnson was the first player off Detroit's bench as Stan Van Gundy searched for defensive effort, and his plus/minus rating of +7 was second-best on the team. Johnson is healthy and the Pistons are in a tailspin with five straight losses, so maybe he'll overtake Reggie Bullock (22 minutes) for the starting SF job. We'll monitor his role closely over Detroit's next few games.

The fourth-year veteran responded with a decent game for fantasy purposes (one of his makes came from downtown), and he could maintain a 16-20 minute role until Reggie Jackson returns from his severely sprained ankle. That said, Galloway is only a deep-league option while Ish Smith and Luke Kennard are healthy.

            D'Angelo Russell came off the Nets' bench again on Sunday, making 1-of-5 shots for three points, two turnovers and one assist in 14 minutes.
        
        
             He's very rusty and is a combined 1-of-10 from the field the past two games, finally scoring late in the third quarter tonight. Russell also logged 14 minutes in his return on Friday and the Nets are going to play it safe here, so owners should have modest expectations for this upcoming three-game week.

            Alex Caruso was impressive in Sunday's win over the Knicks, scoring nine points on 4-of-6 shooting to go with four boards, eight assists, two steals and zero turnovers in 31 minutes off the bench.
        
        
             Caruso was able to earn some extra minutes in the rotation with both Lonzo Ball (knee) and Kentavious Caldwell-Pope (Achilles) watching from the sidelines, and he kept himself on the floor with his playmaking and solid defense. Ball seems doubtful for Tuesday's game against the Celtics, so Caruso could be someone to think about throwing out there as a deep league streamer or DFS punt play after Sunday's impressive outing.

             Kuzma jammed his right index finger early in the game, but he played through it, and X-rays came back negative so he should be fine. Luke Walton said the lack of minutes were due to defensive issues for Kuzma, but we'd expect him to be back in his standard 30-minute role on Tuesday against the Celtics.

             The Nets blew a lead in the fourth quarter tonight, but Dinwiddie bailed them out by navigating two defenders to sink a tough, leaning shot in the lane (see link below). He made 9-of-13 shots tonight and we haven't seen his role decrease with D'Angelo Russell active. The Nets seem eager to find him minutes and he's worth holding in all leagues as we watch how his role evolves.

             Randle has been fairly consistent with the points, boards and dimes over the past few weeks, but the general lack of defensive stats and turnover issues have been a major hindrance to his fantasy value. We've heard his name floating around the rumor mill a lot lately with the trade deadline approaching, and he's certainly played well enough as of late to attract some suitors, so it'll be interesting to see if there's any fire to the smoke. A trade away from Los Angles wouldn't necessarily be a bad thing.

             Ingram didn't appear to be hobbled by the ankle issue, but he just missed a lot of shots he typically makes. He wasn't the only Laker to struggle with his jumper, as Josh Hart was scoreless in his 17 minutes of action, finishing with one block and nothing else to his credit; while Tyler Ennis also brought doughnuts to the box score with just one rebound, two assists and one steal over 11 scoreless minutes.

If he does miss more time, expect Jerian Grant to continue starting at PG with Ryan Arcidiacono and Denzel Valentine pitching in off the bench.

             Beasley committed some silly fouls in this one, but he made up for that with efficiency, going 7-of-9 from the field and 2-of-2 from the charity stripe for a sterling 86.0 true shooting percentage. Beasley's minutes have been somewhat inconsistent since Tim Hardaway Jr. got back to the court, but he's still been effective with averages of 13.5 points, 4.3 boards, 1.7 assists, 1.2 blocks and 2.0 turnovers per game.

             An illness has been ricocheting around with the Grizzlies, so it's possible they'll keep the rookie away from the team to avoid further contagion. Brooks has been hot lately and is benefiting from the perpetual absence of more veteran teammates, so owners in deeper leagues should just hold tight -- his role will only increase if the Grizzlies keep losing games.

            Mario Chalmers (right shoulder) is being listed as questionable for Monday's game against the 76ers.
        
        
             Chalmers sat out Saturday's game with the shoulder injury, and with Memphis sitting on a 16-29 record, there's not much incentive for Chalmers to try and fight through the pain. We should have another update following Monday morning's shootaround, but if he's out, there will be more minutes for Ben McLemore and Wayne Selden. Stay tuned.

             It sounds like Wright will be cleared to play vs. the Sixers, but whether he takes the court is another question -- he was a DNP-CD on Friday, and Deyonta Davis appears to have usurped his role entirely.

             Harrison's shoulder kept him out of Saturday's game, but that was likely a precaution in the second half of a back-to-back set. Mario Chalmers (shoulder) is questionable for Monday, so Harrison could have a full plate if his veteran backcourt mate can't go.

             Lee's ability to bring a little bit of everything to the stat sheet without hurting you in any one area is what's driving his mid-round evaluation on the season, and with very little depth on the wings in New York, he's not in much danger of losing minutes.

             After a hot streak at the beginning of January, Jack has seen a regression to the mean in the scoring department, failing to eclipse the six-point mark over his past four games. He really doesn't offer anything outside of assists, so he can't be viewed as anything more than a dimes-specialist in deep leagues.

If he's out again on Monday, Derrick Jones Jr. will have another opportunity to start with more minutes falling to Justise Winslow and Wayne Ellington. Dragic sat out Saturday's game, and if he's out again on Monday, Josh Richardson would spend more time running the offense.

             Birch brought some great energy off the bench and played the entire fourth quarter of Sunday's impressive win over the Celtics. He's been nice on the defensive end for Orlando since entering the rotation three games ago, posting averages of 6.7 points, 7.0 boards and 2.3 swats per game, so he could be someone to think about grabbing as a shot-blocking specialist in deep leagues.

             This was the first time in Biyombo's career that he failed to grab a single rebound while logging at least 20 minutes of floor time, and this was easily his worst game since entering the starting lineup. That said, he's been quite good as a starter this season with averages of 9.1 points, 10.3 boards and 2.3 swats per contest on 56.3% shooting from the field and 87.9% from the stripe, so we'd anticipate a bounce-back performance on Tuesday against Sacramento.

             Gordon has been connecting on just 33.6% of his shot attempts over the past eight games, although hes still been effective with averages of 16.5 points, 8.5 boards, 2.3 assists, 1.3 triples, 0.8 steals and 2.4 turnovers per game. We should see a regression to the mean with his jump shot soon enough, and the steals numbers should also start trending up as well. A favorable matchup against the Kings on Tuesday could help him to start moving in the right direction.

            Evan Fournier helped Orlando earn their first win in Boston since 2011 on Sunday, tallying 19 points, three triples, three boards, three dimes, one steal, one block and one turnover in 35 minutes.
        
        
             Fournier was hot from start to finish in this one, and he helped the Magic go on a huge run during the third quarter to give Orlando a 19-point edge heading into the fourth. He's reportedly being pursued on the trade market by some playoff contenders, and he could certainly help a postseason team, but his fantasy value would be best served in Orlando. For what it's worth, he has said he's not asking for a trade.

             As an added bonus, Simmons chipped in one steal and two blocks, which is something he typically doesn't bring to the box score. Simmons has now scored nine, 16, four and 23 points in his previous four outings, and that up-and-down play has been a consistent trend this season. He's more of a deep league guy.

             Payton did a nice job of picking his spots in the offense, and he was a huge factor in the Magic snapping their 14-game road losing streak. He had a slow start to the year, but he's really picked up his play over the past month with averages of 16.5 points, 6.5 dimes, 1.5 steals and 3.0 turnovers per contest on 54.4% shooting from the field and 76.6% from the stripe, which has been good enough for sixth-round value in 9-cat leagues. He should be able to close out the year as a mid-round guy.

             Horford never really got going in this one, and he's been prone to the occasional dud this season, but we'd expect a bounce-back performance on Tuesday with a more favorable matchup against the Lakers. Aron Baynes played through a sinus infection but finished with just one rebound, one assist, one block and one turnover in five minutes off the bench.

             The rookie got off to a very slow start in this one, attempting just three shots through the first half of action, and while he never really got going offensively, he still rounded out his stat line with the peripheral statistics. Tatum has yet to have two bad games in a row this season, so we'd expect a bounce-back performance on Tuesday with a much more favorable matchup against the Lakers.

             Morris did a nice job on defense against Aaron Gordon, and while there's not much disparity in his minutes based on whether he's starting or coming off the bench, he's just been better as a starter this season with averages of 12.0 points, 1.4 triples, 5.5 boards and 1.5 dimes per contest on 43.5% shooting. He should get another start on Tuesday against the small-ball Lakers.

             Brown was one of the few Boston players to come through offensively, but he was regularly roasted by Evan Fournier on the other end of the floor, and overall, Boston's defense was not up to par in this one. The Celtics have now dropped three games in a row for the first time this season, but we'd expect them to buck that trend on Tuesday in Los Angeles.

             Irving added five triples, seven boards, five dimes, one block and one turnover in his 40 minutes of floor time, and also went 7-of-8 from the stripe to give him a 75.4 true shooting percentage to accompany his 30.5 usage rate.

             No surprise here, as Kyrie Irving (shoulder) is good to go after a one-game absence. Even though he plays a few minutes less as a reserve, his averages as a starter are pretty similar. As always, he's worth owning if you don't mind his field goal percentage.

             As expected, he will not play on Sunday vs. the Spurs, his seventh straight game on the shelf. ""We'll look at him when we get back to Indiana,"" coach Nate McMillan said. ""But he's not practicing with the team yet."" The Pacers don't play again until Wednesday vs. the Suns, but it doesn't sound like his return is imminent. Domantas Sabonis will continue to see a boost in value as long as Turner is out.

             ""I can just read him on the floor anywhere, especially when hes coming downhill, Hardaway said of his chemistry with Burke. ""Yeah, it was immediate. I kind of know his game so well. Even when I wasnt playing with him the past couple of years, I definitely watched him in Utah, Washington."" The Michigan alumni combined for 13 points in the fourth quarter vs. the Jazz on Friday, and Burke has now created another position battle in New York between himself, Jarrett Jack and Frank Ntilikina. We'll be watching the rotation closely.

             This comes from the team's game notes, so we'll hopefully get another update after the morning shootaround. Irving said a couple days ago that he would try to play and he ""looked good"" at Saturday's practice, but it's possible the Celtics hold him out as a precaution. If he can't go, Marcus Smart and Terry Rozier will have to step up and Al Horford would get a nice bump.

             He was rolling to start this game, making all nine of his first shots including all seven of those treys. That's not really a surprise because Lillard is en fuego since returning from injury, averaging 26.8 points, 4.7 boards, 8.0 assists, 1.2 steals and 3.0 treys on 50.5 percent from the field and 89.7 percent from the line. The Blazers are right in the thick of the playoff race and Dame's owners can expect him to suit up for every game he can as a top-10 player in standard leagues.

             The minutes were down due to some bigger lineups, but Napier did play well in his time out there. For what it's worth, Dame Lillard said after the game that Napier was encouraging to pass the ball more late in the contest, so Napier looks to have the star player in his corner. He's worth a long look if you need a point guard.

             He was a ghost in the first half with no points and one rebound before half, but he really got it going late to earn a home win. His first field goal attempt didn't even come until there were eight minutes left in the third quarter. Towns put up his 40th double-double on the season, and he did so very efficiently (6-of-7 from the field, 8-of-9 from the line) on offense.

            Devin Harris (head) was scoreless across six minutes in his return Saturday at Portland.
        
        
             Harris was 0-of-2 from the field and he did not contribute in any other area while posting a minus-7 rating. He was getting about 18 minutes per night before this one, and he barely got into this one. Despite a four-game schedule coming up, he isn't even worth using in the deepest of fantasy leagues at this point.

            J.J. Barea (groin) finished with 12 points across 23 minutes on Saturday in Portland in his return from a one-game absence.
        
        
             Barea also added six assists and two rebounds with two turnovers, making his way back from a one-game absence due to a slight groin injury. It appears safe to get him back into the active fantasy lineup if you normally rely upon him, especially since the team has a four-game week upcoming. However, the Mavs have a back-to-back next Friday and Saturday, so Barea could be held out of the lineup as a precaution due to his groin issue. Be careful.

            Wesley Matthews finished Saturday's loss at Portland with a team-high 23 points over 38 minutes.
        
        
             Matthews hit 7-of-15 from the field, including 3-of-9 from behind the 3-point line, while adding 6-of-8 from the charity stripe. He also added five rebounds, two assists and a steal while turning it over twice. January has easily been his best month of the season, as he is averaging 16.3 points, 3.6 rebounds, 2.4 assists and 1.0 steals per game in eight outings in the month. As such, he is a sell-high candidate, as it's likely the team will start playing some of its younger talent more down the stretch.

            Andrew Wiggins scored a season-high 29 points during a 115-109 win over the Raptors on Saturday, adding five rebounds, three assists and one 3-pointer in 36 minutes.
        
        
             He shot the ball well with his 11-of-21 from the field and 6-of-6 from the line. Wiggins also pulled down two huge rebounds late in the game to help the Wolves snap their two-game losing streak. It's not really a surprise that Wiggins blew up because Jimmy Butler (knee) didn't play. It doesn't sound like Jimmy will be out long, so this strong game doesn't really change Wiggins' outlook.

             While this shooting line is tough to shallow, Teague did make plays late and coach Tom Thibodeau went with him down the stretch yet again. Tyus Jones keeps playing well for the most part and Teague hasn't exactly been thriving, but it does look like Teague has some leash to close games. He's actually a decent buy-low option, especially if Jimmy Butler needs to miss more time.

             Barnes had an ugly 3-of-13 performance from the floor, and he was 0-of-4 from behind the 3-point line to snap an 11-game streak with at least one triple. It was also his first single-digit performance in 23 outings dating back to Dec. 2. Chalk it up as just one poor outing. He'll look to get back on track Monday night against Washington, the first of a four-game schedule in the upcoming week.

             It looked like coach Tom Thibodeau was going to close with Jones here, but Delon Wright ripped him to get Jeff Teague back in the game. Jones is only a handcuff with only slight standalone value. He also didn't play any SG with the injuries to Jamal Crawford and Jimmy Butler.

             Nowitzki was a very efficient 8-of-12 from the field, including 3-of-4 from behind the 3-point line, and he added 2-of-2 from the free-throw line while posting zero turnovers. Disco Dirk hit 20 points for just the second time this season, each coming over the past five outings. He has had a couple of solid scoring outings in January, but his production has still been rather erratic.

             It wasn't a huge game, but this works. Although, the last time Bjelica started at small forward he put up 24 points, eight boards, three dimes, three steals and five 3-pointers in 41 minutes. We don't know the extent of Jimmy Butler's injury yet, but it doesn't sound serious and his right knee hasn't given him problems in years. Bjelica is more of a deep add for now.

             He came through in the clutch with some made free throws and coach Tom Thibodeau trusted him down the stretch.

             Surprisingly, this was just his second 30-point game of the season, and also just the first time he's topped 20 in back-to-back games since November. Lowry has also been bombing 3-pointers lately with 9.6 attempts per game over his last three, making 4.7 of them. He's at his best when his jumper is falling, so we could see Lowry go on a heater.

             The 3-pointers are back with five attempts and several of them coming on a high degree of difficulty. DeRozan had missed his previous 11 attempts from deep over his last four, but he still managed to make at least 44 percent from the field in all of those. He's also been dropping dimes like a clumsy toll booth attendant with 5.7 per game in his previous January games. He's not just a scorer anymore.

             Foul trouble got him in this game and quiet games from Valanciunas are nothing new. Overall, he's still been around being a top-100 player, so he's still a hold in standard leagues.

             Gobert was a very efficient 6-of-9 from the field, and he didn't have any turnovers. He was on his way to a pretty strong stat line, but foul trouble kept his numbers down a bit. Still, his overall performance was pretty impressive. In addition, he was able to play in the back-to-back set, so that's another good sign for his fantasy owners.

             Favors hit 5-of-10 from the field while picking up three assist and a steal, and he had a game-best plus-18 rating. He is available, and some teams have called to ask about him, and performances like this will certainly help improve his stock and appeal. He remains a hold in standard leagues, but his short-term outlook is a bit murky. It might be best for his fantasy value if he remains in Salt Lake.

             He closed this game out next to Kyle Lowry and DeMar DeRozan, and also hit all six free throws. Wright is quickly becoming one of the best perimeter defenders in the NBA and he'll find himself getting minutes in the upper 20s on a regular basis. His ability to fill so many stats makes him a hold in standard leagues.

After being bumped from the starting five on Friday, he was back starting with Rodney Hood (leg) on the mend and Jingles was playing with a chip on his shoulder. He continues to have top-100 fantasy value whether starting or not.

             The Rockets came up huge in the fourth yet again with a 24-17 edge to earn this win. They clinched the tiebreaker against Golden State, but they do have their work cut out for themselves to catch the Warriors with a 3.5-game deficit. As for Paul, his scoring average is up from last year and he's holding steady as the No. 6 player in nine-category leagues per game on the season.

Picky fantasy owners might complain about his 1-of-6 night from behind the arc and 4-of-7 from the free-throw line, but he more than made up for it in the other categories. He'll look for better numbers from behind the arc and at the stripe in his next outing Monday in Atlanta.

Yesterday, coach Mike D'Antoni said he was going to play him around 30 minutes, but on Saturday he added there was a ""little bit of a tug of war"" with him and someone else regarding the minutes cap. Harden probably won't have a cap against the Heat on Monday.

Even with Danilo Gallinari (glute), Austin Rivers (heel) and C.J. Williams (ankle) injured, Evans isn't doing enough to warrant fantasy consideration. Once the team gets healthy his value will be negligible.

             The 3-pointers were not dropping with Gordon missing all nine from deep, which means he was on the other end of the spectrum today after a 30-point explosion against the Wolves.

He made up for his shortcomings at the stripe by going for eight rebounds, a steal and a blocked shot. His fantasy window will close quickly if and when DeAndre Jordan (ankle) is able to return to the Clippers. If Jordan is dealt, Johnson has a little more staying power unless he is also shipped elsewhere.

            Tyrone Wallace made another start Saturday at Utah, but he managed just 12 points over 39 minutes.
        
        
             Wallace struggled to get to that dozen, hitting 3-of-7 from the field, including 1-of-3 from behind the arc. Most of the scoring was done at the free-throw stripe where he was 5-of-6. He also chipped in with four rebounds, an assist and a blocked shot. Wallace has some short-term fantasy appeal while Austin Rivers (heel), Danilo Gallinari (glute) and C.J. Williams (ankle) are on the shelf. But as soon as the teams gets healthier he will see his already marginal fantasy appeal shrink significantly.

             Williams broke the previous record held by his head coach Doc Rivers. He also finished 9-of-21 from the field, 2-of-8 from behind the arc and a perfect 11-of-11 from the free-throw line, while adding seven assists, two rebounds and just three turnovers across 40 minutes. Williams' name has been bandied about in trade rumors connected to the Cavaliers, and a game like this certainly improves his already high stock.

            Stephen Curry made just 6-of-20 from the field for 19 points during a 116-108 loss to the Rockets on Saturday, adding one rebound, eight assists, two steals, six turnovers and five 3-pointers in 36 minutes.
        
        
             When the Warriors lose, it's usually because of turnovers. That and not rebounding the ball well was their undoing today, and the Warriors usually find themselves losing in net possessions because of those two aforementioned issues. Curry also had his worst FG% today since Nov. 16 in Boston and he only made 2-of-4 from the line. He's human after all, apparently.

             Teodosic had an ugly shooting night, going just 3-of-11 from the field, although he was able to bang home a pair of 3-pointers. He had trouble avoiding the referee's whistle, picking up four personals, and that likely didn't help him as he was unable to get into any sort of rhythm. He'll look for better results against the visiting Timberwolves on Monday. He is also in line for a four-game week starting on Monday, so he's a decent option in standard fantasy play.

             Reed hit 2-of-3 from the floor and 2-of-2 from the free-throw line, but he was limited to just 12 minutes. He did chip in with five rebounds, but it wasn't enough to make him useful even in the deepest of fantasy formats or as a contrarian play in DFS. Montrezl Harrell is the better fantasy option if you need a short-term replacement until Jordan is able to return.

Perhaps a positive for this game is the Warriors losing could make them less likely to rest guys.

             It was just a bad game and Thompson couldn't get into a rhythm. After the game, coach Steve Kerr said the turnovers hurt Klay Thompson's flow to get shots. He'll be fine and gets the Knicks on Tuesday.

             With Tyler Johnson (ankle) and Goran Dragic (knee) out, Richardson was the primary ball-handler throughout this game.

            Hassan Whiteside scored 10 points with 14 rebounds, three assists and one turnover in 24 minutes against the Hornets on Saturday.
        
        
             He did not close this game out with Kelly Olynyk, Bam Adebayo and James Johnson handling the frontcourt minutes. Unlike previous instances when he was on the sidelines, Whiteside showed a lot of energy on the bench tonight, so he looks to be OK with this move. Besides no blocks, this line still works and Whiteside looks like the early-round player his owners selected back in October.

            James Johnson scored 22 points with six rebounds, seven assists and one 3-pointer in 29 minutes against the Hornets on Saturday.
        
        
             He ran the offense a lot in this game because the Heat basically had no point guard -- not counting Josh Richardson. Johnson was a lacking some burst coming into this game, but he looked much better on both ends. Plus, he managed to score five points in four seconds to help the Heat earn a big win. His owners should feel a little better and can expect him to be a mid-round guy.

             This was a bad, bad loss for the Hornets to drop them to 18-26. They had the ball with a five-point lead and 37 seconds left, but Nic Batum turned it over twice and the Heat came through with James Johnson scoring five points in four seconds. This loss will probably heat up the trade rumors even more for the former All-Star. Walker's fantasy owners should be rooting for him to stay put.

             Saric also added seven assists, six rebounds and a steal while hitting 4-of-10 from the floor, 1-of-5 from behind the arc, and 4-of-4 from the free-throw stripe. He didn't have the great shooting night, but at least he chipped in across multiple categories. He has been one of the most consistent 76ers for fantasy owners, and he'll continue to post mid-round value with the team in no hurry to bring back Markelle Fultz (shoulder).

             Like every other Charlotte starter, Williams is reportedly on the trade block. He's revived his career in Charlotte and he was playing great before this dud, so he's still a strong hold in nine-category leagues.

             McConnell hit 5-of-10 from the field, taking advantage of a slight bump in playing time with Jerryd Bayless (wrist) and J.J. Redick (leg) on the shelf. He is enjoying a season-best four-game streak with double-digit point totals, averaging 14.0 points, 5.5 assists, 3.8 rebounds and 2.8 steals per game during the four-game span. He is a nice short-term pick-up if you need help at the point guard position, but know his value will dry up once Redick is back in two weeks.

             Maybe this will help his trade value. Earlier this week, ESPN reported the Hornets are looking to get Batum's contract off the books, but it's not going to be easy with Batum having his worst season in years. He's still an OK hold in standard leagues.

He finished 5-of-9 from the field, including 3-of-5 from the perimeter, while adding three rebounds, two assists and, perhaps most importantly, zero turnovers. TLC should continues to see a decent amount of minutes in the next couple of weeks with J.J. Redick (leg) sidelined, making him an attractive short-term addition in deeper play.

             He's basically been the Russell Westbrook of bigs with league-leading 224 turnovers while he's also made just 41.6 percent from the field over his previous January games. He also had an uncharacteristic three-game streak of scoring below 20 points. On the other hand, Cousins has been a double-double machine with 11 in his last 12 and he continues to lead bigs in dimes.

             Covington did a little bit of everything, grabbing five rebounds while posting four steals and three assists with a blocked shot. He appeared to hurt his left elbow down the stretch in Thursday's game in Boston, but that wasn't a problem in this game. His playing time was limited in the fourth quarter, but it was due to a lopsided score and nothing to do with any type of ailment.

He bounced back nice after an eight-point dud last time out in Boston on Thursday. Simmons will look to keep it going in Memphis on Monday night against a team allowing 102.1 points per game.

             Henson didn't really do anything different or pick up any slack with Giannis Antetokounmpo (knee) sidelined. It's a good thing that Henson is rather consistent, but fantasy owners were likely hoping for a little bump in offensive responsibilities with 'The Greek Freak' sidelined. It didn't happen.

             Snell did his part, hitting 6-of-12 from the field and 3-of-7 from behind the 3-point line, taking advantage of the absence of Malcolm Brogdon (personal) away from the team and Giannis Antetokounmpo (knee) on the shelf. Snell is starting to heat up, and he'll continue to challenge for his spot in the starting five, currently held by Brogdon. He is worth stashing away if available off the waiver wire.

            E'Twaun Moore scored nine points with three rebounds, two assists and one 3-pointer in 33 minutes against the Grizzlies on Saturday.
        
        
             The magic has kind of worn off on Moore as he's failed to crack top-150 value in standard leagues over his last 10. His upside isn't too high to begin with and he wasn't going to flirt with 60 percent from deep like he did in December, so he's more of a drop than a hold in nine-cat leagues.

            Sterling Brown made the start in Saturday's game at Philadelphia and he finished with 14 points over 39 minutes.
        
        
             Brown hit 5-of-9 from the field, including 4-of-7 from behind the 3-point line, while adding two rebounds and a steal. His playing time has been increasing, but this was easily his best scoring performance of the season. Once Malcolm Brogdon (personal) and Giannis Antetokounmpo (knee) are back, Brown's fantasy appeal will be non-existent in standard leagues. However, he isn't a bad low-cost DFS option on Monday against Phoenix if Brogdon joins Antetokounmpo on the sidelines again.

             He's become one of the most consistent players in the NBA and is doing it all on the stat sheet this month. His usage rate has only slightly dropped this season to 22.2, but the difference has been his pristine 58.3 TS% -- that blows away his previous career-high 53.2. Holiday looks like a lock for early-round value.

            Eric Bledsoe managed to hit just 5-of-18 from the field across 38 minutes in Saturday's 116-94 loss in Philadelphia, finishing with 14 points.
        
        
             The good news for Bledsoe's fantasy owners was that he was able to post five steals with three assists and a blocked shot to somewhat salvage the stat line, although his field-goal percentage hurt. He'll look to get untracked against the Suns, his former team, when they pay a visit to Cream City on Monday. The Suns rank dead-last in the NBA allowing 112.2 points per game.

             Middleton did a good job picking up the slack with Giannis Antetokounmpo (knee) sidelined. The Greek Freak will be out again on Monday, so Middleton has a chance to put up another monster stat line against the visiting Suns, a team that owns the worst scoring defense in the NBA. You'll want Middleton in your DFS lineup for that one, too.

             Yesterday, he just matched his season-low six points and Gasol has not done much scoring this month, averaging 15.7 points, 8.8 boards, 4.2 assists, 1.3 blocks, 0.8 steals and 0.7 treys. He's still one of the best stat-stuffing centers in the league, so his fantasy owners have little to worry about as long as he's in the lineup.

             After his season-high 21 points on Friday, he was given an opportunity to start because of Andrew Harrison (shoulder) battling his nagging injury. Unfortunately, Wayne Selden stole the show off the bench with his 31, so McLemore may have lost some ground and he even fouled out. He's had some serious consistency issues in his career, so he's only a deep-league add.

             He had nowhere to go but down after his career-high 22 points on Friday, but the minutes were still there. Brooks doesn't really do too much outside of scoring, but he's consistently hit jumpers with 2.0 treys per game this month. He's more of a 14-team guy or a scoring specialist.

             That 31 destroyed his previous career-high of 13. He was the star of Las Vegas Summer League and he was expected to be the favorite to start opening night, but a quad injury in October kept him down for most of this season so far. Andrew Harrison (shoulder) didn't play today and it's not like he's totally safe, so maybe Selden gets some additional run. He's still more of a 16-team flier for now, but there is opportunity for him if you want to see how this pans out.

             He looked great in the first unit today and he certainly is going to give coach Erik Spoelstra something to think about as a possible starter even when Goran Dragic (knee) can return. Ellington has the greenest of lights and is up to 3.0 treys per game on the year, and now he's starting to see minutes in the 30s to increase his season average of 25.3 minutes per game. He's worth owning in standard leagues right now.

             He suffered the injury much earlier in the game, but he wasn't ruled out until the fourth quarter. Hopefully, this injury isn't going to cost him too much time, but getting ruled out in a close game is discouraging. Green's bad injury earlier this year was to his right knee. He finished with eight points, a season-high 16 rebounds and one steal in 24 minutes. Jarell Martin and Ivan Rabb will be filling in for him tonight with Martin being worthy of a speculative add in deep leagues.

            Lauri Markkanen made 8-of-16 from the field for 19 points during a 113-97 win over the Hawks on Saturday, adding four rebounds, one assist and no turnovers.
        
        
             His jumper was not there today to snap his 12-game stretch with at least two treys, so he took it to the Hawks with drives and cuts. All eight of Markkanen's makes were at the rim during this game, so he gets some extra credit for turning in a strong offensive performance despite not having his bread and butter. He looks like the real deal as a must-start option in all leagues.

             He did run the offense a little more than usual, but his playing time didn't really go up with Ryan Arcidiacono filling in nicely at the backup PG. Valentine is likely going to trend down once Zach LaVine's minutes increase closer to 30.

             It's been a while since we've seen Bjelica play small forward and he's had some big games in that role. The Wolves have a massive hole to fill on Jimmy, so Bjelica may be a speculative add in deeper leagues. Expect more Tyus Jones and Shabazz Muhammad to help out, too.

             This comes out of nowhere after Butler played a whopping 42 minutes on Thursday night. The team is calling it a sore right knee, so this could be a lingering issue for one of the league's hottest players. Butler has had problems with his left knee, but he hasn't had any noteworthy injuries to his right since 2013. With him out, Andrew Wiggins will have to shine while Shabazz Muhammad and maybe even Marcus Georges-Hunt steps up.

             He did not play in the fourth quarter because the Bulls had a big lead. Coach Fred Hoiberg said that LaVine was going to play in the fourth and hit around 24 minutes, so he went safe here. LaVine has slowed down from his hot start, but it doesn't sound like it'll be long before he's at 30 minutes.

             He probably would've hit over 30 minutes today, but the Bulls had this game in hand early in the fourth quarter. Kris Dunn is still dealing with headache and dizziness, so he's likely going to be out beyond Monday -- he has already been ruled out for that game against the Pelicans. The Bulls do have four games next week, so maybe Grant could be worth starting in a deep league.

             The Hawks did their version of the Rockets with 48 attempts from deep, but they only made 11 of them (22.9%). Schroder is also taking more 3-pointers these days with a slight upward trend as the season has gone on. Consequently, his FG% has drop in each of his full months this season. Regardless, he'll be a major stat filler, assuming the Hawks can avoid garbage time.

             He's coming off an 18-point game on Wednesday, but his numbers are down this month. In his previous January games, Collins only averaged 9.3 points, 5.4 boards, 1.1 blocks and 0.6 steals. The Hawks are probably going to start selling off their pieces soon, so Collins has some stash appeal to go with low-end standalone value. Additionally, he's playing a lot more power forward these days, which may be a minor negative to his value.

Leg injuries have been a thorn in the side of Hood for years now and he's not exactly a fast healer either. Plus, there's a chance the Jazz are being cautious because he's reportedly on the trade block. He's still probably worth owning in 12-team leagues, though. Joe Ingles and Joe Johnson should pick up some run.

             Coach Mike Budenholzer said almost a week ago that he likes Plumlee as a center, but maybe this game changed his mind. Plumlee just isn't worth owning even as a starter.

            Paul George scored 36 points with seven rebounds, two assists and five 3-pointers in 32 minutes against the Cavs on Saturday.
        
        
             The Cavs forgot to guard PG-13 in the first half and he hit a slew of tough shots in the second half to put this game out of reach. George has been a complete scorer for most of this month with 20 points per game since Dec. 31 even before this explosion, but his usage is slightly down due to some others taking more shots. Even if the usage remains down, George looks like he's ready for a strong finish this season.

            Russell Westbrook was too much for the Cavs on Saturday during a 148-124 win, scoring 23 points, nine rebounds, 20 assists, two steals, five turnovers and one 3-pointer in 35 minutes during the 148-124 win.
        
        
             He shredded the Cavs guards with some beautiful kick-out passes for open shots. Westbrook also used his left hand a lot during this game, which isn't unusual for a guy who writes with his left hand. His 3-point attempts continue to drop and that's helped him maintain a respectable 49.1 percent from the field over his previous 10. Westbrook is getting hot at the right time.

             His most impressive feat today was that he missed four free throws with no time off the clock. He missed two, grabbed the rebound off the second miss and was fouled right away, and missed his next two. On the positive side, Roberson played well on defense as per usual, but he doesn't have much fantasy value.

             The bad news is he made just 1-of-5 from the line, but that's OK. He scored 10 points in the first 4.5 minutes of this game as the Cavs tiny lineups could do nothing to stop him early. Adams also did some damage on the offense glass with five on that end, which extends his lead in that department for the season. Adams is putting up a great season in reality and in fantasy.

             That's two terrific games in a row for Melo with a 27-point game coming on Wednesday. Although, the matchups were in his favor with the Lakers struggling against stretch fours and the Cavs, well, not being very good at all on defense. Still, Melo's subpar December is behind him as the Thunder seem to have found their offensive stride this month.

            LeBron James scored 18 points with three rebounds, seven assists, one block and two turnovers in 38 minutes against the Thunder on Saturday.
        
        
             He looked discouraged for most of this game because his team is still in Strugglesville, and apparently they got a vacation package to stay there for a while. James also had a minus-33 in plus-minus today, which marked his fourth-worst of his NBA career -- his worst came back on Jan. 8 vs. MIN. The Cavs have lost six of their last seven games while LeBron has a brutal 118.8 defensive rating over that span -- Isaiah Thomas has a 123.8. Expect the Cavs trade rumors to pick up after this embarrassing loss.

            Isaiah Thomas made 8-of-14 from the field for 24 points with four assists, one steal and four 3-pointers in 26 minutes against the Thunder on Saturday.
        
        
             We won't focus about the defensive issues, but that's probably the biggest takeaway here. On the bright side, Thomas had traces of a breakout game coming with solid usage and already getting to minutes in the 30s before this loss. He's still struggling at the rim this season and only made 48 percent from that range before today, so he really needs to fix that to resemble the 2016-17 version of himself. If you've been stashing Thomas, you should feel great about it so far.

             He got the start for the second half because Kevin Love was ill after just three minutes. Thompson couldn't stop Steven Adams and he just hasn't looked the same all year. There are some trade rumors surrounding him and those will probably be heating up with the Cavs getting destroyed on defense.

Bickerstaff could give him a long leash today. He's not really worth owning long term, but give him a look if you have dead weight. He's a tourney option in DFS, too.

             Presumably, this means Dragic is not going to play today. Ellington is going to be firing away and should get over 35 minutes. Coach Erik Spoelstra wants him to take 20 treys, so today could be the day. He's worth owning in standard leagues while the Heat are so shorthanded.

             While this was tied for his best scoring game since Nov. 21, Crowder's defensive output just isn't there for stopping opponents and the counting stats of steals and blocks for his fantasy owners. Maybe some changes could help him, but Crowder hasn't done enough to be owned in standard leagues at this point.

             It was obvious he wasn't feeling well, so it would've been nice to have been given a heads up. Love was struggling since Isaiah Thomas returned, so this ugly stat line opens his buy-low window even more because of how it will skew his value. Although, the Cavs may have to think about starting Tristan Thompson after they were crushed inside. The Cavs are off until Tuesday, so Love should be ready for that one.

            Mario Chalmers (shoulder) is a game-time call against the Pelicans on Saturday.
        
        
             He played 21 minutes against the Kings on Friday, so chances are this is a minor injury. If he's out, the Grizzlies could extend Tyreke Evans' minutes while guys like Wayne Selden and Ben McLemore would benefit. Kobi Simmons hasn't played lately.

             He had a revenge game against the Kings on Friday with 21 points in 27 minutes and he may actually see around 30 minutes again today with Andrew Harrison out out the lineup. It's always risky to run out B-Mac in fantasy, but it's not the worst idea today.

             He's had a lingering shoulder injury an it's kept him on the injury report for most of this month, but the Grizzlies will hold him out in the second half of a back-to-back set. With him out, Wayne Selden and Ben McLemore could see more run, especially if Mario Chalmers can't go.

            Lonzo Ball (knee) was able to get on the treadmill on Saturday, but Luke Walton said that he's still several steps away from being able to play.
        
        
             He is still not close to a return, but this is progress in the right direction. Ball has been ruled out for Sunday and head coach Luke Walton was non-committal when discussing his status for the Lakers' upcoming five-game road trip, which suggests he'll miss Tuesday's home game against the Celtics as well. Expect Tyler Ennis and Alex Caruso to handle the point guard minutes, with Jordan Clarkson also picking up the slack.

            Goran Dragic (knee) might sit out Saturday against the Hornets due to a bruised knee.
        
        
             He played in the final 7:38 of Friday's game, so maybe he took on some contact and it swelled up on him. The back-to-back set is probably a factor here, but the Heat could really use Dragic with Tyler Johnson (ankle) out. If Dragic can't go, Josh Richardson will be running the offense while Wayne Ellington, Justise Winslow and Derrick Jones Jr. would see more playing time.

             The ABC broadcast said Love wasn't feeling well with about 10 minutes left in the second quarter and the team now says he's questionable just a few minutes later. Love had a couple ugly shots and he didn't look well on the bench, so it's possible he doesn't return.

             That's not good and getting ruled out two days in advance could mean he misses even more time. The Bulls are also on the road to play the 76ers on Wednesday, so Dunn's fantasy owners should consider him doubtful for that game. Jerian Grant will get at least a couple starts and could be worth a look based on his volume. Expect to see more minutes going to Denzel Valentine to help handle the ball, and Ryan Arcidiacono could be the backup PG.

The Jazz have a huge stretch coming up with a tough game against the Clippers tonight and then a lot of road games before the deadline. In case you missed it, Hood is questionable for tonight against the Clips.

             The video below showed him doing layups with both hands, so this is a big step in his rehab. Earlier this week, he had a huge cast on his left hand from his surgery back on Dec. 26. He was expected to be out for 6-8 weeks, so the All-Star break seems like a reasonable target. His return would destroy the fantasy value of Bismack Biyombo, who has been a revelation this month.

             After being called a game-time decision at shootaround on Friday, he was ruled out about two hours before tip against the Pacers. Ingram did suffer an aggravation to his ankle injury, but his tweak on Wednesday didn't look as bad. Expect him to be a game-time call and going through shootaround could help his chances -- he didn't go through shootaround on Friday and did some work in practice today. If he's out, Kyle Kuzma, Josh Hart, Julius Randle and basically the rest of the rotation could take more shots.

             The team ruled him out a day in advance for Friday's game, so there's a decent chance he's a game-time call tomorrow. Plus, he went through some activities at practice on Saturday. Caldwell-Pope's injury doesn't sound serious, but it's worth a mention that his Achilles has bothered him in his career before this issue. If he's out, Josh Hart and Corey Brewer figure to pick up more wing minutes.

The Lakers next game is Tuesday against the Celtics, so his fantasy owners should consider him between questionable and doubtful for that game. With him out, it's been Alex Caruso stepping up the most at the point while Tyler Ennis starts. Josh Hart could also benefit if other starters are out.

            Andre Roberson is expected to play his normal amount of minutes against the Cavs on Saturday.
        
        
             He played just 17 minutes on Wednesday, so Roberson should be in the upper 20s as the primary defender on LeBron James. He has more value in reality than in fantasy.

Mario Chalmers (shoulder) is also listed as questionable for Saturday, so the Grizz could be quite thin at PG, leaving Tyreke Evans to handle more point guard responsibilities than usual.

             He did only miss one game from this slight groin injury. Although, Barea's groin strains have been a major problem for him in his career, so the Mavs are probably going to be careful with him. His return should take some playing time away from Yogi Ferrell, Devin Harris and maybe a heating-up Dennis Smith Jr.

With Chandler Parsons (illness, knee) and James Ennis III (calf) already ruled out, the Grizz may be very shorthanded on Saturday. Tyreke Evans, Wayne Selden and Dillon Brooks will likely log all the minutes they can handle.

             It is somewhat surprising that Sixers are starting TLC instead of T.J. McConnell. It likely has to do with the defensive assignment of guarding Milwaukee's Eric Bledsoe. However, both Luwawu-Cabarrot and McConnell will be asked to log heavy minutes, as Philly is without Bayless, J.J. Redick (leg), and Markelle Fultz (shoulder). Luwawu-Cabarrot has started one game previously this season. He finished with four points, one rebound and one assist over 23 minutes in that start.

            Jerryd Bayless (sore left wrist) has been ruled out of Saturday's game vs. Milwaukee.
        
        
             Bayless missed six games back in November due to pain in this same wrist. Hopefully, the injury won't linger as long this time around. The Sixers are also missing J.J. Redick (left leg), so Philly's backcourt will have very little depth on Saturday. It sounds like Timothe Luwawu-Cabarrot has been tabbed to slide into the starting lineup to replace Bayless. However, T.J. McConnell is arguably the more attractive streamer and DFS target on Saturday, as he'll log plenty of minutes off the bench.

Brogdon is attending to a personal family matter. The Bucks announced on Saturday that Antetokounmpo will miss Milwaukee's next two games to manage soreness in his right knee.

             Johnson exited Monday's game due to the ankle sprain and has missed each of Miami's two games since. However, he did receive good news on Thursday when he visited a specialist in New York that confirmed the initial diagnosis. This is simply a game-notes designation, so we should have a formal update from the team shortly. If Johnson is unable to play Saturday, Justise Winslow and Wayne Ellington would again see an uptick in playing time off the bench.

Giannis has previously missed two games this season due to the same issue. He plans to return to game action on next Friday (Jan. 26) vs. Brooklyn.

             The Knicks have four games left on this road swing, including a back-to-back Thursday and Friday of next week. Hardaway Jr. was able to do plenty of damage in limited playing time in Friday's win over the Jazz. He finished with 31 points, five rebounds, three assists and six 3-pointers in just 27 minutes. Despite the minutes cap, he should be owned and started in all leagues.

             Hood scored 18 points in 29 minutes on Friday vs. the Knicks but was unable to play in the fourth quarter with due to pain in his leg. The Jazz will provide an update by Saturday afternoon, but it certainly wouldn't be surprising if they held him out of the back end of a back-to-back. If Hood is unable to play Saturday, Donovan Mitchell, Joe Johnson and Alec Burks would likely see an uptick in minutes.

             Nancne also chipped in with 11 rebounds, three assists, three steals and two blocked shots to quell the fears of his fantasy owners. He was rather limited in a lopsided loss on Wednesday, but he played with no restrictions and a lot of production in this one. It appears safe to trust him in all fantasy leagues of 12 or more teams after this solid performance, although his fantasy appeal remains rather limited as long as Kyle Kuzma, Brook Lopez and Julius Randle are also healthy and sucking up frontcourt minutes.

            Kyle Kuzma (hand) finished with 13 points in Friday's 99-86 victory against the visiting Pacers.
        
        
             Kuzma suffered a sprained joint in his hand in the fourth quarter of Wednesday's game, but he was able to tough it out. He was just 5-of-15 from the floor, including 3-of-9 from behind the 3-point line, while going 0-of-3 from the free-throw stripe. He did chip in with five rebounds, three assists and a blocked shot over 32 minutes to offset the ugly shooting night.

             Yeah, he got a big contract this summer, but Hardaway Jr. has performed while healthy. THJ did miss two clutch free throws with 33 seconds left in the fourth, but did ice the game with two free throw makes with nine second left. The Knicks will get another back-to-back set on Jan. 25-26 and another on the 30th and 31st, so his owners will have to make sure he's good for those. He needs to be owned in all leagues regardless.

             Randle hit 7-of-12 from the field while adding four rebounds, two assists, a steal and a blocked shot over his 20 minutes. He is playing with a jammed right ring finger and fracture, but the ailment didn't seem to affect his shot in the win. If you were hesitant to use him in your fantasy lineup because of the injury, fear not. He looks like he'll be just fine playing through the situation.

             The blocks stood out, which is hardly a surprise for the NBA's top shot blocker this season. As for his scoring, Porzingis has seen a downward trend in points per game for every month so far this season. He's struggled more on two-point shots lately, especially in the paint at just 26-of-64 in January (40.6 percent). That's actually worse than his above-the-break 3-pointers percentage at 42.2 percent. No need to worry here, of course.

             While he didn't play well on offense, Kanter is probably pleased to get the win in Utah. A few years ago, he asked for a trade and you might remember how Kanter said the thing he missed the most about Utah was the view of the mountains. Kanter seems to be back in the good graces of coach Jeff Hornacek with this game and a 20-point outing on Wednesday following a nine-minute game on Monday. He's been a top-50 player this season, so his owners will be rooting for the Knicks to win more games.

             He made all four from the line to get him to 50 straight makes, which is already a franchise record and is just three shy of Stephen Curry's 53 for the most this season. Lee also played really well on defense and his playing time isn't going anywhere. He's been a draft-day steal as he continues to flirt with top-50 value in standard leagues. Although, he is a bit of a sell-high player because he's basically topping out on potential.

The Lakers needed every bit of it, as they had a dismal 2-of-14 night from the free-throw stripe. It was the worst percentage from the stripe by a winning NBA team since 1963. Five players took at least one free throw without a make, and only Clarkson was 2-of-3 to hit.

             He was expected to play around 24 minutes, but this game was close in a game the Jazz really needed before a road trip that starts on Monday. Gobert started slow and did only make 9-of-15 from the line, but he showed some rapport with Donovan Mitchell. He has been a major letdown so far this season, so hopefully he can hang more lines like this one. His owners may want to make sure he's a go for Saturday in a back-to-back set against the Clippers.

             Sabonis hit 6-of-10 from the field while also blocking two shots and posting an assist, as he continues to start in place of the injured Myles Turner (arm). His scoring has been a bit erratic lately, but he continues to pull down his fair share of rebounds. He is averaging 11.3 rebounds per game over his past seven outings, making him an outstanding short-term fantasy addition if you need boards. He'll have his hands full with LaMarcus Aldridge, Pau Gasol and the Spurs in Sunday's road game, however.

             The move to the bench didn't really hurt his output with Ingles and Rodney Hood basically just swapping roles. Ingles isn't much of a scorer anyway, so expect him to be around a top-100 player regardless of is position in the lineup.

             He had a wide-open look for a 3-pointer in the corner that would've tied the game 19 seconds left, but it did not go down. The Jazz playing from behind may have helped Johnson's playing time along with Hood being dinged up, so don't expect him to hit 27 minutes too often. This decent game doesn't really make him an add in standard leagues.

             Collison didn't fare very well in town where he played his college ball (UCLA). Perhaps he was just trying to do too much. He has been a bit erratic lately, as he just turned in an impressive 23-point performance in Portland last night, hitting five 3-pointers. However, he also has three single-digit point totals over his past six outings. He'll look to regroup Sunday in San Antonio.

             He was really struggling as a scorer coming into this game, making a combined 6-of-26 from the field for 18 points over his previous three games. Rubio's usage rate is slightly trending up this month while he's been able to pile up the steals with 1.9 per game over his eight January games. There's still some hope, but Rubio almost certainly won't match his ADP price tag.

             His move to the starting lineup wasn't the biggest news on Hood for the night. Marc Stein of the New York Times reported that ""there is a growing belief in league personnel circles"" that the Jazz could trade Hood before the deadline. He seems to be fairly comfortable with the Jazz no matter where his playing time comes from, so his owners should want him to stay put. Although, he did have a minor leg issue late in the game, so keep an eye out on that for the oft-injured wing.

             This being his 35th 30-point game of his career is no surprise, but Booker's improvement this year has been how he's does so much more than score.

             He looked like Warren at times during his game with a few really nice cuts to the basket.

Most of his value is as a stash.

             It was all good just a week ago. Bender was surging last Friday with a 20-point gem two Sundays ago and a 14-point outing last Friday, but he's scored just nine points in his last three games combined. Marquese Chriss (hip) is probably going to miss more time, but obviously Bender isn't gaining much ground with his recent slump.

He also chipped in with two assists and one rebound. He didn't show any ill effects from the thumb injury which sidelined him on Wednesday against the Raptors. He is still only worth using in the deepest of fantasy formats despite the solid game.

             He made 10-of-17 from the field with two emphatic jams in the third and also hit all five free throws. Murray did also foul out for the first time in his NBA career due to T.J. Warren getting some favorable calls. The second-year guard has been extremely durable in his NBA career and missed his first game due to a concussion, but getting back out there is another positive for Murray in his breakout campaign. He should flirt with early-round value going forward.

             Harris hit 7-of-19 from the field, and 1-of-7 from behind the arc, so it wasn't the best of shooting nights. He made up for it by adding three rebounds, an assist and a steal with just one turnover across 31 minutes. Since his seven-point effort on Jan. 13 in Chicago, Harris has posted 16.3 points, 4.3 rebounds, 2.3 assists and 1.3 blocked shots over his past three outings. The points are only slightly under his season average despite the poor shooting recently.

             He also had an 18-board game in the last outing he didn't start next to Mason Plumlee and just eight in his start next to Plumlee on Wednesday, so it's fair to say his rebounding will increase as long as coach Mike Malone avoids that two-center lineup. You never know with Malone, but Jokic should still be able to produce huge lines regardless of what Malone has cooking.

             Coach Mike Malone ditched his two-center combos in this game with Plumlee not logging a minute next to Nikola Jokic. Despite the loss, that wasn't the problem for the Nuggets, so this loss shouldn't dissuade Malone from staying away from that combo. Plumlee is a fairly easy drop candidate unless you're desperate.

             The Denver second unit couldn't hang in this loss, but Barton still played down the stretch as the Nuggets failed in their comeback attempt. Barton's playing time should be close to 30 minutes even when the Nuggets are healthy, so don't worry too much about him missing shots tonight.

             It's his first time starting next to Nikola Jokic and that unit looked fine. However, the Denver second unit got thumped, so maybe coach Mike Malone goes back to putting Lyles with that group. Either way, Lyles' fantasy value will depend on his shot making, so his value doesn't change too much as a starter. He's still a decent add if he was dropped.

             It's his fifth 20-point game of the season and he's also scored in double figures for six straight. Carroll did have a mild tweak to his right knee, but he obviously looked fine. He also closed as the power forward in this game, which will be important for him because of D'Angelo Russell getting in the mix to take wing minutes away. The needle doesn't move too much on Carroll here because DAR's return may hurt his playing time, so he's more of a hold than anything else.

             Smith bounced back nicely with a solid 7-of-11 shooting night after turning in an ugly 1-of-12 performance on Wednesday in Toronto. There's something about the home cooking that he likes, as Smith is 39-of-73 (53.4 percent) from the floor over his past six home contests, and 23-of-62 (37.1 percent) from the field across his past six on the road. The good news for Smith's fantasy owners and DFS players is that this was the first game of a four-game homestand through Jan. 27, and nine of his next 10 are at Little Caesars Arena in Detroit, too.

Six of his rebounds were at the offensive end, too, giving his team second chances to score.

            Caris LeVert scored 12 points with four rebounds, five assists, three steals, one block and one 3-pointer in 27 minutes against the Heat on Friday.
        
        
             It certainly wasn't his best game overall, but LeVert took over late with two huge shots to help the Nets get this win. He logged a good amount of minutes with D'Angelo Russell and he closed next to Spencer Dinwiddie. Coach Kenny Atkinson could roll with all three together in some matchups, so that'll be something to watch. We'd expect LeVert to trend down, but today's strong finish helped him.

             Beal also connected on 4-of-7 from behind the 3-point line, while adding 8-of-9 from the free-throw stripe. Head coach Scott Brooks admonished his team after a subpar effort last time out, warning of minutes decreases for players not giving maximum effort. Beal didn't see his time curtailed, and he has been on fire lately and wasn't likely one of the players Brooks was trying to get through to.

             Wall hit 6-of-15 from the field, including 2-of-5 from behind the 3-point line, while also chipping in with three boards and a steal. It wasn't all great, as he had five turnovers, but apparently Scott Brooks liked the effort enough. The head coach warned of changes in minutes coming if the effort wasn't there, but Wall had 37 minutes and is apparently not in the doghouse.

             Morris didn't have a great shooting night, going just 4-of-14 from the field while making 1-of-5 from behind the arc, but he made up for it by going 4-of-4 from the free-throw stripe while adding two assists, a steal and a blocked shot with just one turnover. Scott Brooks tried to light a fire under his team after an ugly performance last time out, and it seemed to work with a 10-point road win against a decent squad.

             His minutes went down for the fifth straight game, so he's only on the radar in deeper leagues at the moment if you need a handful of assists, 3s and defensive stats.

             Coach Kenny Atkinson pulled RHJ in the fourth to go with a frontcourt combo of DeMarre Carroll and Quincy Acy at the four and five. Carroll had a huge game in this one while Acy also did a fine job on Hassan Whiteside, so Atkinson's feel for this game was a big factor on his lineup moves. While D'Angelo Russell's return could slightly hurt his scoring, Hollis-Jefferson should still have a chance to be a mid-round guy.

             He had eight points on 4-of-6 shooting, four rebounds and one steal in 24 minutes in a fill-in start for Marc Gasol (illness) on Wednesday, but Gasol was back in the lineup tonight and played 27 minutes. There's still a good chance Gasol is moved before the deadline, and if that happens Davis would be the next man up. He has some stash appeal in deeper leagues.

             He played just 27 minutes due to the lopsided score, so hopefully he responds well in the morning because the Grizzlies play the second game of a back-to-back set vs. the Pelicans. Teams usually don't shootaround on the second day of back-to-backs, so just make sure he's active later in the evening.

            D'Angelo Russell made his return against the Heat on Friday, missing all five shots from the field and making 1-of-2 from the line for one point with two assists and two turnovers in 14 minutes.
        
        
             The rust was there for Russell tonight. He played nine minutes in his first stint with most of his minutes coming next to Caris LeVert. He also didn't close this game after his five-minute stint in the second half, but that's no surprise after missing two months. It'll probably take Russell a handful of games to get going again, so his owners may need to wait a little longer before they start feeling good about him being back in the lineup.

            Ben McLemore came out of nowhere to score 21 points against the Kings on Friday, hitting 6-of-13 shots and 6-of-6 free throws.
        
        
             Talk about a revenge game. McLemore was a DNP-CD in his previous two games and played a total of 15 minutes in January prior to tonight, but the Grizzlies let him have some fun against his former team. He added two rebounds, two assists, one steal and three triples in 27 minutes, and while he gave the coaching staff something to think about, fantasy owners can ignore him unless he earns a permanent spot in the rotation.

             Porter has been struggling since New Year's Eve, posting just two multi-point performances over his past eight outings until tonight. He was a very efficient 5-of-9 from the floor, including 4-of-5 from behind the 3-point line. The Wizards had a team discussion, and head coach Scott Brooks said if there was a lack of effort, playing time would be curtailed. Apparently OPJ got the message, as he was able to snap out of his funk and post his most points since Dec. 29.

             Oubre was an efficient 9-of-14 from the floor, including 5-of-9 from behind the 3-point line, while going 3-of-3 from the free-throw line. He is working on a string of seven straight performances with 10 or more points, and this was by far this best yet. He is averaging 16.3 points and 4.7 rebounds over the past seven games. Head coach Scott Brooks said if the effort isn't there, players are going to see their minutes decrease. That won't be a problem for Oubre, who has been bringing it nightly over the past month or so.

             The Nets went small a bunch in this game and even threw some triple teams at Whiteside. They also attacked him a lot with their guards getting in the lane to help Whiteside get all those swats. He's looked like he's back to being in tip-top shape, so his fantasy owners should have tons of confidence in plugging him into their lineups.

             Head coach Scott Brooks said the team had a ""good talk"" about everyone's performance in Thursday's game, and that if the effort isn't there, players will have their minutes curtailed. Apparently Gortat fell into that boat on Friday, as he had just two personal fouls and no injury to report. If Gortat's minutes continue to be cut, it would mean more playing time for Kelly Oubre Jr., and Ian Mahinmi could potentially see a bump depending on the matchup.

             He's flying under the radar a bit with Bogdan Bogdanovic playing so well, but Hield's rest-of-season outlook is promising with the Kings resting two veterans in every single game. He was 3-of-17 from beyond the arc in his previous four games, but he found his shot tonight and should be a nice source of points and triples going forward.

             He ran the offense more than usual with a few of those dimes coming in a flashy variety. Richardson may have had one of his worst defensive games as Caris LeVert went right at him late, but obviously that won't hurt his playing time. After a slow start, he's having a breakout season and should keep it going.

             Coach Erik Spoelstra seems to like him in the second unit and Ellington did finish this game. He'll be taking close to 10 treys per game until Tyler Johnson (ankle) can return and Ellington should still have value after that because of no Dion Waiters.

             He did most of his damage in the first half against Jahlil Okafor and Olynyk did get some key minutes late. He also had a minor right knee injury in the second half, but he stayed in the game. He'll have some inconsistency because of  Bam Adebayo playing well and coach Erik Spoelsta playing the matchups, so he's more of a low-end hold in standard leagues.

             That's more like it. Lowry hit just 8-of-30 shots in his previous two games since returning from his back injury, but he looked more like himself tonight. He added three rebounds, three assists, one block, one steal and four triples, helping the Raptors snap their four-game losing streak against the Spurs. He did play 35 minutes tonight, so we'll see how his back responds on the second night of a back-to-back set vs. the Wolves.

            Serge Ibaka was invisible in Friday's win over the Spurs, scoring just four points (2-of-7 FGs) with seven rebounds and two assists in 30 minutes.
        
        
             Ibaka usually guards the opponent's best frontcourt player, but coach Dwane Casey switched Jonas Valanciunas onto LaMarcus Aldridge pretty early into this game because Ibaka wasn't giving the Raptors anything. You have to wonder if his knee is acting up again, as he hasn't blocked a shot in four straight games and is shooting 35.1% from the field in that span. After a strong December, his value is trending down in a hurry.

Mills played 28 minutes in the loss, adding four rebounds, one assist and one triple.  Kawhi Leonard (quad) is out indefinitely, Rudy Gay (heel) is a couple weeks away and Manu Ginobili (bruised thigh) is day-to-day, so Mills will continue to benefit in their absence. He's still just a low-end option if you need triples and a handful of dimes.

             Tony Parker finished 1-of-9 from the field in 17 minutes, so the Spurs rolled with Murray and Patty Mills for most of the night. We're seeing a lot more two-PG lineups lately because the Spurs are so banged up, so Murray is trending up. He's averaging 7.8 points, 7.0 rebounds, 2.2 assists and 1.4 steals in 20.8 minutes per game over his last five, and while he's not a great option in re-draft formats at the moment, his dynasty owners have to be pleased with his recent progress.

             The Raptors switched Jonas Valanciunas onto LMA early into the game and the move paid dividends for Toronto. Pau Gasol said that Aldridge is going to be the ""focal point"" of the offense going forward with Kawhi Leonard (quad) out indefinitely, but we'll chalk this up as a rare off night for the big man. The good news is that he salvaged his fantasy line in other categories, racking up 14 rebounds with two assists, one steal, two blocks and one triple in 37 minutes.

             With Rudy Gay (heel) still at least a couple weeks away from a return and Kawhi Leonard (quad) out indefinitely, Anderson has a nice window to provide some solid fantasy value. He hit 2-of-5 shots with a pair of turnovers and bounced back nicely after his dud against the Nets on Wednesday. He's worth owning as the 12th or 13th player on a standard-league roster.

            Ricky Rubio,  Donovan Mitchell, Rodney Hood, Derrick Favors and Rudy Gobert will start against the Knicks on Friday.
        
        
             The Jazz get wild here with a couple new starters in Hood and Gobert returning. Hood has been shooting the ball really well, so maybe he does get a few extra minutes in the first unit. If he stays healthy, he should be worth owning in all standard leagues.

             He was a game-time call, but the team rules him out before warmups. Ingram did not go through shootaround, so him sitting out tonight is not a surprise at all. With him out, Josh Hart should see big minutes while Corey Brewer, Gary Payton II and a few others pick up minutes. Kyle Kuzma will have to do some heavy lifting.

Jordan looks like the biggest fish in the expiring contract market and the Clippers will probably be rooting against the Cavs to put more pressure on them to make a move. Because Jordan doesn't really score much, his fantasy value likely won't change too much on whatever team he goes to.

If he is back, that should move Emmanuel Mudiay out of the rotation and it sounds like Mason Plumlee is getting bumped from the first unit regardless. Will Barton will slide over to the wing and may even come off the bench.

He will probably get a full workload as the Warriors look to set their franchise record for consecutive road wins as they go for their 15th.

Maybe the national TV game helps his chances to play, but for now his owners probably shouldn't count on him.

             This report adds the Cavs are pursuing Hill to potentially slide into a dual-guard role, starting at either backcourt position or playing as a reserve. This will be a lot easier said than done because Hill just signed a massive three-year, $57 million deal this summer, so there will probably have to be other teams involved. Now that Hill is going to be rested, a trade could help his fantasy value, but a limited role in Cleveland wouldn't be the best spot for him.

             He left practice early for an upper respiratory, so we'll have to wait until tomorrow to figure out how ill he is. Last night, he played nine minutes next to both C.J. McCollum and Damian Lillard. He also played next to just Dame for 12 minutes and eight minutes next to just C.J. Coach Terry Stotts said he is going to play him more, so he's trending up and is worth a look if you need a PG.

             It's being called a mallet fracture, which is just below the tip of Randle's finger. The Lakers will need him with Brandon Ingram (ankle) possibly missing this game. Randle is a lefty, so this injury may not affect him too much on offense. He's an option in DFS and should be owned in standard leagues now that he's seen consistent minutes.

            Lonzo Ball (knee) did not practice on Friday and remains out against the Pacers.
        
        
             He didn't do anything at all, so it's looking like Ball will need to miss at least a couple more games. He'll also have to go through a full practice before getting the green light for a game. With him out, Tyler Ennis should continue to start while Josh Hart, Corey Brewer and Gary Payton II may see increased playing time.

             He tweaked his non-shooting hand on Wednesday and did not return. The Lakers were blown out, so not returning in that game is almost irrelevant. With Brandon Ingram (ankle) likely out again, Kuzma could be very busy tonight, especially with Lonzo Ball and Kentavious Caldwell-Pope also out.

            Brandon Ingram (ankle) is a game-time decision to face the Pacers on Friday.
        
        
             He did not go through shootaround, so it's certainly possible he misses at least one game after tweaking his ankle on Wednesday. He also missed Monday's game with an ankle sprain and the Lakers have played him heavy minutes this season. If he's out, that means Josh Hart will be very busy while Corey Brewer, Tyler Ennis and maybe even Gary Payton II pick up some decent run.

             It would appear he'll be back in action after missing Wednesday's game. It's going to be a guessing game on who sits for the Kings, but the best guess would be Kosta Koufos because of Zach Randolph returning to Memphis tonight. Labissiere will have some stand-alone value in the short term, but most of his value lies in his mysterious upside.

             He'll miss his fourth contest and being ruled out a day ahead of the game suggests he may need more time off. With DJ out, it's been Willie Reed getting the start, but Montrezl Harrell has been stepping up in the second unit. Harrell is worth a short-term look, assuming you're OK with bad FT%.

Sean Kilpatrick and Sterling Brown would likely see a big bump in minutes while Matt Dellavedova may run the offense a bit. We'll be looking for more details on why Brogdon may not play.

             This is just a game-notes designation, so we'll have to wait to hear from coach Jason Kidd or Antetokounmpo himself for confirmation and an explanation. Hopefully, Milwaukee is merely limiting Antetokounmpo's workload and making sure he has enough rest, as they have done earlier this season. However, the Bucks don't play on Friday or Sunday, so this is not the part of a back-to-back. We'll wait for an update before jumping to conclusions. Khris Middleton and Eric Bledsoe will see their usage rates spike with Giannis on the sidelines.

He had seen his playing time reduced in recent weeks even when healthy, so Bell can be sent to waivers in standard leagues now that he sidelined. Kevon Looney will soak up most of the minutes abandoned by Bell.

             Holmes has missed each of the Sixers last two contests. His return will mean fewer minutes for Trevor Booker and Amir Johnson off the Philly bench.

             Russell, who has not played since November 11th, is on track to make his long-awaited return to the Nets lineup. It's surprising that he claimed he won't have a minutes limit, considering how careful Brooklyn tends to be regarding injuries. Thus, it's safe to assume he will log fewer than 30 minutes in his first game back. Coach Kenny Atkinson should shed some light on that subject when he speaks with the media later today.

            The Hornets have made Kemba Walker available in trade discussions, according to Adrian Wojnarowski of ESPN.
        
        
             Charlotte is in 11th place in the East, despite having a payroll north of $115 million. Walker is the team's best player, but they need to shake up the roster and including Walker in a trade is the only way to get another team to swallow one (or two) of the undesirable contracts on the Hornets' books. We're less than three weeks away from the February deadline, so we'll keep a close eye on this situation going forward.

             There have been some rumblings this season that the Celtics might try to pry Davis from New Orleans; however, Woj shot down that idea. ""Boston's uniquely positioned in that they have draft picks and young players and all the things  if a team was gonna trade Anthony Davis  all the things you'd want,'"" said Woj. ""But [the Pelicans] aren't trading Anthony Davis... He wants to make it work in New Orleans.""

             All things considered, this certainly qualifies as encouraging news. ""The MRI was pretty good this morning  nothing glaring,"" Kerr said in a radio interview on Thursday. ""The X-ray was fine yesterday. So, it doesnt appear to be more than a bone bruise, but bone bruises can be tricky to heal. So, well see what happens, but so far the news has all been good."" The Warriors are expected to formally announce the results of the MRI on Friday. We'll provide an update at that time.

            Damian Lillard scored a game-high 26 points during a 100-86 win over the Pacers on Thursday, adding five rebounds, eight assists, one block and two 3-pointers in 40 minutes.
        
        
             It's safe to say he's back as he's driving more and getting to the line more frequently, too. Since his return on Jan. 10, Lillard averaged 26.0 points, 4.6 boards, 7.8 assists, 1.4 steals and 2.2 treys on 47.8 percent from the field and 88.6 percent from the line -- 7.0 attempts per game from the charity stripe, too. His fantasy owners can probably expect him to flirt with top-10 value the rest of the way, especially with the Blazers in the thick of the playoff race.

             It's a much-needed Nurk Alert after two terrible games in favorable matchups against the Suns and Wolves, averaging just 8.5 points, 6.0 boards and 1.0 blocks in 21.0 minutes per game. On the positive side, Nurkic is finally making his shots from the field at 52.0 percent from the field this month before his 8-of-14 tonight (57.1 percent). He still has some major work to do to meet his ADP price, but things are looking up right now.

             He did go to the locker room for about five minutes in the second half, but McCollum did return to the game in the fourth. The team said he went to the locker room for nausea, so maybe he had a stomach issue. The Blazers get Friday off before they take on the Mavs on Saturday, so McCollum should be fine for that one.

             Coach Terry Stotts said he was going to try to get Napier more minutes and he kept his word. We've seen the Blazers go with more Napier before and he was able to get to minutes in the upper 20s even when Dame Lillard was healthy back in a late-November stretch. Napier probably won't be a difference-making add in most leagues, but give him a look if you need a point guard.

However, he still has mid-round value on the year and is still a hold in 12-team leagues. Myles Turner (elbow) being out should help, too.

             He had been cleaning up while James Harden was out, averaging 22.4 points, 7.1 boards, 9.7 assists, 1.3 steals, 0.6 blocks and 2.9 treys on 44.8 percent from the field and 92.6 percent from the line. Paul does get staggered from Harden to buoy his value, so he's still shaping up to be a top-10 value in standard leagues even while Harden is back to 100 percent.

            James Harden (hamstring) returned on Thursday against the Wolves, making 3-of-15 from the field for 10 points with two rebounds, seven assists, two steals, two blocks and one 3-pointer in 26 minutes.
        
        
             He was expected to play 24-25 minutes and didn't quite look like himself, which is expected after missing the last seven games. Harden's stints were shortened as he had his lightest first-quarter playing time in any game over of the last two seasons. Coach Mike D'Antoni even called Harden ""rusty"" during his in-game interview to start the fourth. Rust aside, it won't be long until Harden is posting massive numbers.

             It was the seventh time he's led the Rockets in scoring this year and he hit a buzzer-beating heave to cap a strong third. He was able to replace James Harden's rough night and may have also benefitted from Harden being limited in his return. Gordon's numbers have been a little worse when both Harden and Chris Paul are 100 percent, so games like this one will be few and far between going forward now that both studs are back. He's a sell-high player again.

             His playing time may have been a little higher than this, but the Rockets went with a more traditional lineup against a bigger Wolves team for most of the fourth. Expect Mbah a Moute to play around 35 minutes against the Warriors on Saturday, so he will be on the board as a DFS punt play or as a streamer.

             His playing time didn't increase too much even with Trevor Ariza out of the lineup. Anderson was guarding Taj Gibson for most of his minutes on defense, so it wasn't a terrible matchup there. The sharpshooting four will be taking a hit with James Harden back, so he's a possible drop candidate in shallower leagues or formats that don't reward 3-pointers.

Tucker should have better luck on shooting on Saturday against the Warriors, so he's a possible punt play with Gerald Green and Trevor Ariza out one more game.

Thanks to his durability, KAT currently sits at No. 1 for total value in nine-category leagues so far this season.

             Those free throws came as he ran down an offensive rebound with 17 seconds left, dribbled the ball up, was able to draw the foul on Shelvin Mack on a drive, and he connected on the free throws with 11.2 seconds left to give the Cavs the lead for good. Thomas' restrictions seem to be fading away with 32 minutes coming on Monday, and the Cavs not practicing has to help, too.

             He has dropped off since Isaiah Thomas returned, averaging just 13.9 points, 7.1 boards, 1.3 assists, 0.9 steals, 0.8 blocks and 2.0 treys on 39.8 percent from the field in those eight. Love's usage rate has dropped to 20.1 in his minutes with Isaiah Thomas, which is way down from his 26.6 without him. While Love may take a small hit, he really shouldn't be this bad. Consider him as a buy-low player who is fully capable of being an early-round guy.

             He played fairly mistake-free ball, but Rose wasn't really running the offense and stood in the corner a bunch. With Isaiah Thomas back in action and the Cavs second unit having some capable scorers, it's going to be really tough for Rose to produce value in even 16-team leagues while the team is healthy.

             He just celebrated his 36 birthday on Wednesday and Wade threw down another dunk tonight -- his 10th this season. Derrick Rose coming back could take a few shots away from Wade, but hopefully you're not really leaning on him too much. Plus, we're expecting him to rest later this season.

            Aaron Gordon scored 17 points during a 104-103 loss to the Cavs on Thursday, adding 11 rebounds, two assists, three steals and two 3-pointers in 36 minutes.
        
        
             He did not start the second half, but he came in after just one minute into the third quarter -- you can feel free to guess why. Gordon has really struggled with his jumper since his return from injury on Dec. 28, making just 28.7 percent of his 115 attempts, which explains why he's made just 39.2 percent from the field over those 10. Either way, Gordon continues to fill it up and he should be able to climb into the mid-40s for FG% soon enough.

             He's been boom or bust lately, but Payton has finally found his mojo over his last dozen games. In that span, he averaged 16.1 points, 4.5 boards, 6.9 assists, 1.5 steals and 0.6 treys on 54.2 percent from the field and 78.0 percent from the line. Not coincidentally, Nikola Vucevic (hand) went down 12 games ago, so that may explain his recent improvement. Keep him rolling, though.

             He had three mega duds over his last four games, so there was some concern Simmons wasn't 100 percent from is back injury. He may have put those concerns to rest with an emphatic chasedown block on Isaiah Thomas and more burst on both ends than he's shown coming into this game. Maybe the artist formerly known as Juice can heat up again.

             It seems like just yesterday Mario was in the doghouse and wasn't going to get out last year, but he's found his role as a combo forward in the second unit. Over his last five games, Hezonja averaged 11.6 points, 3.2 boards, 1.6 assists and 1.2 treys in 24.6 minutes per game. He has a lot of avenues for minutes because he plays so many positions, so he's a decent stash in deep leagues with some stand-alone value.

             Even though Marreese Speights checked in ahead of him, Birch was still able to find minutes. It feels like it's just a matter of time before he absorbs all of the backup center minutes and he's been dynamic per minute so far, so maybe he's a decent deep-league stash on a 13-32 Magic team.

Although, he did pull his version of the ""you're not breaking up with me, I'm breaking up with you"" line after the game when he said he's on to the next one after Rihanna. Additional good news for Embiid is the team is hopeful to drop his back-to-back restriction, so that'll be something to watch for the back-to-back set on Jan. 28-29. Embiid was also looking at his right hand a couple times in this game, so that may still not be right.

His assists are down, but Simmons continues his Giannis-like output in defensive stats with 2.0 blocks and 1.4 steals over his last five. Expect him to get hot in a hurry and hope that his output at the charity stripe continues to drop -- he's only attempted five freebies in his last four.

            T.J. McConnell scored 15 points with two rebounds, two assists, three steals and two 3-pointers in 26 minutes against the Celtics on Thursday.
        
        
             He looks to be the winner from the J.J. Redick injury and he should play down the stretch most nights, assuming someone else isn't hot. McConnell was very efficient in this game with his 5-of-8 shooting line, so he probably won't be getting into the teens too often. The 76ers play every other day until their back-to-back starts on Jan. 28, so McConnell is worth a look if you need a boost at PG for the next 11 days while Redick is on the shelf.

            Jerryd Bayless scored four points with two rebounds, two assists and one turnover in 25 minutes against the Celtics on Thursday.
        
        
             Coach Brett Brown said Bayless would get the first shot to take J.J. Redick's spot in the first unit, and so far it's worked out with the first unit faring well today. However, he's not going to get enough shots or minutes to have consistent value in most leagues. Plus, he won't be doing much outside of shooting jumpers.

             He did look to hurt his left elbow down the stretch, but he stayed in the game. Covington is not playing well in 2018, averaging just 7.8 points, 5.0 boards, 1.6 assists, 0.8 steals, 0.2 blocks and 1.4 treys on 33.3 percent from the field. We've seen this movie before with RoCo going through some slumps, so his fantasy owners just have to weather the storm. While he's a clear buy-low option, don't expect him to be as good as he was in November or after the break last season.

             You'd think Smart making his shots would lead to a big line in a start, but that wasn't the case. Chalk Smart doesn't usually pan out in DFS and he actually came into this game with a lower scoring average as a starter compared to coming off the bench. Smart is playing well enough to be owned in standard leagues.

            Terry Rozier scored four points with one rebound, two assists and one steal in 20 minutes against the 76ers on Thursday.
        
        
             His playing time didn't really change with Shane Larkin picking up the extra burn from Kyrie Irving (shoulder) not playing. Perhaps Rozier making just 3-of-19 from deep in his last four is why coach Brad Stevens didn't lean on him more -- the Celtics trailed for most of the game. Rozier should continue to hang around top-150 value in standard leagues, and expect him to be better if Irving misses more time.

             Coach Brad Stevens has leaned on Horford a lot to guard Ben Simmons in this matchup, but he covered Joel Embiid more down the stretch during this loss. Horford trails only DeMarcus Cousins and Draymond Green for total assists among PF/Cs and he's been one of the most well-rounded fantasy bigs over the last decade.

             He picked up a good chunk of the Kyrie Irving (shoulder) minutes as the fourth guard in the rotation, and he even played key fourth-quarter minutes over Terry Rozier. Irving may be questionable for Sunday night, so it's possible Larkin finds himself in the 20s for minutes again. There's really no incentive in adding him unless we get word Irving is officially going to sit against the Magic.

             He took a shot to his nose in the first half and was bleeding, but Morris didn't need to go to the locker room after the training staff was able to patch him up. Unlike his brother Markieff in Washington, Marcus is playing well these days with with two strong games coming into this one, averaging 15.5 points, 8.0 boards, 2.0 dimes and 2.0 treys over his previous two. Still, he is likely going to have a back-to-back restriction and he doesn't offer much outside of scoring, so he's probably not a guy most 12-team owners should target.

Tatum is in one of his most inefficient stretches of his NBA career, but Tatum has been racking up the defensive stats lately with nine blocks and five steals over his last four games. He's one of the most un-rookie 19 year olds ever.

             Well hello there, Mr. Stifle Tower. Back on Jan. 13, Gobert was expected to be sidelined for 7-10 more days, so he'll beat that timetable by a day, assuming all goes well. This is obviously huge news for the Jazz and Gobert's patient fantasy owners. His return means guys like Derrick Favors, Jonas Jerebko, Joe Johnson and Ekpe Udoh will all be taking a noticeable hit.

            Brandon Ingram (sprained ankle) is questionable for Friday's game vs. Indiana.
        
        
             Luke Walton said that Ingram tweaked his left ankle on Wednesday but could have returned in necessary. That makes him sound closer to 'probable' vs. the Kings but owners should check for updates after Friday's shootaround. Josh Hart and Corey Brewer will both benefit if Ingram can't go.

             KCP left Wednesday's game with a strained Achilles and it's not surprising to see him listed as 'out'. He did warm up prior to the second half on Wednesday, and we've yet to hear about an MRI, so hopefully it's nothing serious. Josh Hart has benefited the most when KCP misses time this season.

His inclusion on the injury report looks like a precaution, but deep-league owners should confirm his status on Friday.

             The Cavs haven't cited a specific minute-limit for Rose, but we're not expecting him to play much and he's not worth a pickup with Isaiah Thomas healthy. Among other concerns, coach Ty Lue has hinted that Rose's workload will only increase on nights when Dwyane Wade is rested.RotoGrinders.com Daily Slant: Despite Rose's return, Isaiah Thomas is still an elite DFS play on this slate. His price is only going to rise from this point forward and if his 33 minutes on Monday is any indication, he's about ready to be unleashed. The ORL/CLE tilt is probably a slate-changer - if this one stays competitive, both teams play such horrific defense that it has potential to turn into a shootout. Thomas is the top dollar per point play on the CLE side.

            Kris Dunn has been diagnosed with a concussion and he's not traveling with the Bulls for Saturday's game in Atlanta.
        
        
             Dunn took a nasty fall during Wednesday's game, landing face-first and knocking loose a few teeth. A concussion was initially ruled out, but subsequent tests revealed that he will indeed be in the league's strict concussion protocol. Chicago's next three games are on the road and it's unclear when Dunn might join them -- they play Saturday (at Atlanta), Monday (at New Orleans) and Wednesday (at Philadelphia). Jerian Grant and Denzel Valentine should earn more minutes if he misses any games.

             Josh Jackson would head back to the bench with Warren active, undermining his appeal as a streaming and DFS option. Warren has missed the past two games but the injury sounds minor, and we should have confirmation of his status after Friday's shootaround.

             Chriss was injured on Jan. 7 and initially diagnosed with a strained hip flexor. The fact that he's considering another MRI suggests it's not responding to therapy as he'd hoped, but we'll know more in the coming days. Owners should brace themselves for more DNPs while awaiting updates -- Dragan Bender gains the most if Chriss misses time.

If Stephenson does sit, Cory Joseph and Joe Young figure to gain the most.

The Kings are saying that his measurements in athletic tests are better than they were before the draft, and he still has some intrigue in dynasty formats.

             Kris Dunn is obviously locked in as the starter, Zach LaVine can play some backup point and the Bulls want to get a look at Cameron Payne (foot) once he's healthy, so Grant is expendable.

""Trying to figure out different ways to get us on the court together and have [Shabazz] out there."" We've seen some 3-PG lineups for the Blazers in recent weeks with Napier sharing the floor with Damian Lillard and McCollum, and it makes sense for Portland to get Napier more involved because he's been really solid on offense. He's an excellent handcuff for Lillard's owners and will have some standalone value if this trend continues.

             Williams encountered waves of defenders and a lot of Gary Harris tonight, which limited him to 6-of-18 shooting and a modest four free-throw attempts. This is the first time in nearly a month that he's been held under 20 points, ending an incredible 13-game stretch during which he averaged 31.2 points and 4.4 triples while shooting 47.9% from the field and 91.9% from the line. He's shattered all expectations in his 13th NBA season, and it's hard to 'sell high' on him unless you're getting back a definite top-50 value.

Wayne Ellington should be owned in 12-team leagues while Justise Winslow is the next man up after that.

            Montrezl Harrell had another big game on Wednesday with 18 points, eight rebounds, two steals and two blocks, making 6-of-10 FGs and 6-of-13 FTs in 31 minutes.
        
        
             Doc Rivers said before tonight's game that DeAndre Jordan's sprained ankle remains swollen and is ""progressing slower than the Clippers have expected."" That opens the door for Harrell to play extended minutes again on Saturday, and either way he should have secured a steady bench role. In the past five games, he's averaging 16.8 points, 6.6 rebounds, 1.0 steals and 1.0 blocks, while making 64.8% field goals. Just beware his terrible FT shooting.

             Better yet, the veteran 'rookie' made 5-of-9 field goals and 2-of-2 free throws. He's been dogged by inefficiency (37.9% FGs, 78.6% FTs) and poor defensive stats (0.4 steals, 0.2 blocks), so it was nice to see him address those concerns tonight. Let's see if he can do it again on Saturday (at Utah) and Monday (vs. Minnesota).

             The jumper was not falling tonight and the Nuggets first unit wasn't able to get it going in the second half. Jokic's numbers have been considerably worse when he's next to Mason Plumlee over his last 11 games with better efficiency, a higher usage rate, better rebounding numbers and better assist percentages all when Plumlee is on the bench. Jokic will be fine regardless, but his owners should be rooting for Plumlee to move to the bench.

             DeAndre Jordan (ankle) was ruled out 90 minutes before tip-off tonight, so there's a chance he'll be back in the lineup vs. Utah on Saturday. Doc Rivers didn't sound too optimistic, but even without Jordan it's been Montrezl Harrell doing the most damage for L.A.

             It was a big game after a very quiet five-point, 14-minute Tuesday. Coach Mike Malone ditched his double-center lineup on Tuesday, but he went back to it tonight. The lineups with Nikola Jokic and Plumlee only have a -10.6 net rating in the last 11 games, so it hasn't been an effective combo. Plumlee's long-term really isn't there anyway, so most fantasy owners should look for another waiver target.

             While it's a step in the right direction after scoring just three points in back-to-back games, it's still not close to what we saw from Lyles in December. Lyles really needs to make shots to have value, so he's moving from the ""add"" column to the ""drop"" section in shallower leagues. Plus, Paul Millsap (wrist) returning next month would likely hurt him even more, but he may still have three more weeks of decent value.

             He made 6-of-10 FGs and 4-of-5 FTs tonight, marking perhaps his most complete fantasy outing with the Kings. This was Hill's fourth game all season with 20+ points and the minutes were just shy of his season-high, but there's no real cause for excitement. Sacramento is starting to rest veterans and Hill is an obvious candidate for DNP-CDs -- at age 31 he's the fourth-oldest player on the team. Enjoy the production while you can.

             He played 39 minutes and you should double-check that he's not available in your leagues. The Kings will rest 2-3 veterans every game and Bogdanovic is one of the big winners here, as the 25-year-old is more polished than most rookies thanks to years of pro experience overseas. The league's GMs ranked him one of the summer's ""most underrated player acquisitions"" before the season began, and we're starting to see why.

Harris did land on his right shoulder in the first half, but it didn't seem to affect him in this game. He did have a right shoulder injury back in October and November, so his owners may want to make sure he's a full go leading up to Friday. For now, expect him to be very busy in a dream matchup against the Suns, especially with Jamal Murray likely out.

             Z-Bo made 4-of-10 shots overall, including a pair of 3-pointers, but he also turned the ball over five times tonight. He was rested on Monday vs. the Thunder, and DNP-CDs are going to be a familiar theme the rest of the season. If you haven't cut Randolph already, you should at least start considering potential replacements.

             Only getting 15 minutes even when Jamal Murray (concussion) is out doesn't bode well for Mudiay. It wouldn't be a surprise to see Mudiay not play on Friday even if Murray is out. While the usage rate and non-scoring stuff is encouraging, it's really hard to add Mudiay unless you're dropping dead weight.

             Fox committed three turnovers and he shot just 1-of-6 from the field without any 3-pointers. The bright side for fantasy owners is his playing time, which matched his season-high and is further evidence that the Kings are leaning into the youth movement. Fox's FG% and turnovers will be a consistent issue in category-based leagues, but the sheer upside is too high to ignore.

             Utah doesn't have a reliable starting PF in the mold of today's NBA -- even with Rudy Gobert (knee) healthy, Derrick Favors is an obviously awkward fit. They've been linked to Nikola Mirotic in trade talks, and one way or another it's likely they'll find a PF before the trade deadline. Either way, Jerebko is a fantasy pariah.

             Hood also had two steals without a turnover tonight, and it's encouraging to see him chip in across the board -- he's averaging a mere 2.7 rebounds, 1.7 assists, 0.8 steals and 0.2 blocks this season. Thabo Sefolosha (knee surgery) is done for the season, which leaves 20+ minutes available on the wings, so it's likely Hood will absorb some of that -- he played 31 minutes tonight.

             He made 10-of-12 from the field in arguably his best game of the year. Whiteside has really rounded into form over his last five games, averaging 16.0 points, 12.2 boards and 3.6 blocks on 60.8 percent from the field and 81.8 percent from the line. After the Wednesday win, Whiteside did say he was sick for the past couple days, but that may have been referring to a bad loss to the Bulls on Monday. Whatever the case, his fantasy owners should finally have that sour taste out of their mouths from that lingering knee injury.

             The Heat are absolutely rolling and it has a lot to do with J-Rich. Miami has won 15 of their last 20 and they improved to the NBA's third-best road record this season at 14-9. Richardson has been a top-25 player over that aforementioned 20-game sample, so his owners have to be enjoying the ride after the slow start.

             Favors hit 5-of-9 FGs and 4-of-5 FTs tonight, helping Utah snap a two-game skid and improve to 5-18 on the road. He continues to start at center with Rudy Gobert (knee) on the mend, but Gobert could return in late January. When Favors is playing alongside Gobert this season he has a 17.6% usage rate, but without Gobert that rises to 19.6%, and fantasy owners should basically be hoping he's traded to a team that needs a starting big man.

             Mitchell also hit 5-of-7 free throws, with three turnovers in 34 minutes. He's incredibly polished for a 21-year-old rookie and shows no signs of tiring despite averaging 31.4 minutes in a featured role. If you have any doubts, click on the link below for a high-flying dunk when he basically went 1-of-5 vs. the Kings' defense. Whether or not the No. 10 seed Jazz have playoff hopes, Mitchell is locked into a huge role over Utah's final 37 games.

That could change late in the season, but Burks doesn't qualify as a 'stash' candidate -- this is his seventh season in the NBA, after all.

             It was a mild disappointment for anyone who used him in DFS, but he should still be better going forward. Coach Erik Spoelstra has talked about how he wants Ellington to shoot 20 treys in a game and he'll probably get a few more opportunities with Tyler Johnson (ankle) dinged up. He should be considered as a strong hold while the Heat look to replace Dion Waiters' shooting.

             He did close this game in place of Derrick Jones Jr. along with the other four starters. Winslow said he was comfortable playing some shooting guard, so he may get a chance to play 30 minutes until Tyler Johnson (ankle) can return. As this stat line suggests, Winslow isn't exactly a stat stuffer, so he's more of a 16-team option or perhaps even deeper than that.

             This is one of his least-efficient scoring nights of the year, as he made just 6-of-15 from the field and 8-of-15 from the line. On the positive side, this was the first time he's had multiple blocks and steals in a game since Dec. 8. Antetokounmpo will get his numbers one way or another.

On the other hand, his per-minute stats have dropped this month, averaging 8.4 points, 7.4 boards and 1.3 blocks. He's still a low-end hold if you need a big.

Bledsoe has been fairly productive in his other games this month, especially with his 2.6 steals per game over his previous January outings. He's been better than expected on his new team and should continue to flirt with early-round value in standard leagues.

             Stephen Curry also dropped 30, so coach Steve Kerr summed up this night for the Warriors. ""Old school Splash Brothers night,"" Kerr said to describe this win. The Warriors have now won 14 straight games on the road and they'll get a tough test in Houston on Saturday night. Thompson is starting to get hot again and he's played 35 minutes in each of his last four games.

             He played 27 minutes tonight, but that was inflated by garbage time. Ferguson began the month with a bang, dropping 24 points, six 3-pointers and three steals during a blowout vs. the Lakers, but couldn't duplicate the feat vs. L.A. tonight. Since then he's averaged 3.5 points on 25.8 percent shooting, so he should already be floating on your waiver wire.

             Melo's altered role in OKC has led to some swings in his fantasy value, but he's settling in as a designated catch-and-shoot guy -- he was slumping from the field, so it was nice to see him find a groove tonight. He'll look to keep it going when the Thunder seek their fourth straight win vs. the visiting Cavs on Saturday.

             Roberson logged 17 minutes in his first action since late December. He looked sharp and is averaging 26.9 minutes on the season, but OKC didn't need to push him with the game decided in the third quarter. He's a non-entity in points leagues, but has some niche appeal for defensive stats.

             Hart started Monday's game in place of Brandon Ingram (ankle), but tonight his mid-game promotion was the result of Kentavious Caldwell-Pope (Achilles) leaving early. Hart could have some short-term appeal if KCP sits out Friday (vs. Indiana) or Sunday (vs. New York), so keep an eye on the Lakers' injury report. Early indications are that KCP's injury isn't serious.

             It was the 11th time the Warriors had both Curry and Klay Thompson each score 30-plus points in a game, and of course they're 11-0 in those instances. Curry exploded to start the third with 11 points in the first six-plus minutes to start that frame, which led to GSW taking the third by a 32-12 advantage. Curry has been in one of his unfair modes since returning from injury last month, posting a 30.6 usage rate and a 76.7 TS% in those eight. He's arguably the league's best player when he's playing like this.

             OKC was cruising to a lopsided win tonight, so the Lakers played it safe by benching Ingram down the stretch. He finished with eight points, three assists and one rebound. The 20-year-old forward should be fine, but we'll consider him 'questionable' for Friday's home game vs. the Pacers. Check back for more information after Thursday's practice.

            Kevon Looney scored two points with four rebounds and one assist in 30 minutes against the Bulls on Wednesday.
        
        
             He started the second half because of Jordan Bell getting hurt on the first play of the game. Even with Bell likely out of the lineup for at least a few games, Looney just doesn't do enough to warrant a pickup in most leagues. Draymond Green (shoulder) should be back soon, too.

             Marc Gasol and Brandan Wright were both away from the team recovering from illnesses, which left the frontcourt very thin. Green, Deyonta Davis and Jarell Martin all saw their roles increase as a result, and Green is quietly building up steam in January. He's averaging 12.0 points, 8.3 boards, 1.4 assists, 1.1 steals, 0.6 blocks and 1.1 triples this month, and should only see his role expand down the stretch.

             Martin even hit a 3-pointer tonight, taking full advantage of added run in the absence of Marc Gasol and Brandan Wright. Both of those veterans are just day-to-day, however, so this doesn't improve Martin's short-term outlook.

             The 21-year-old held his own in his first start in the NBA, which is encouraging for a Grizzlies team that might commit to rebuilding sooner rather than later. Gasol is day-to-day so Davis is only on the radar as a potential streaming option vs. the Kings on Friday.

            C.J. Miles scored a team-high 21 points off the bench vs. Detroit, hitting five 3-pointers with four rebounds, one assist, one steal and one block.
        
        
             Miles shot 7-of-16 from the field overall, taking four attempts inside the arc. With Miles on board, DeMar DeRozan's increasing comfort from deep, and the emergence of rookie OG Anunoby, the Raptors suddenly have more options to spread the court -- it's helped them quietly earn a 30-13 record, second-best in the East. For fantasy purposes, though, Miles is still just a pure 3-point specialist.

             This was the bounce-back performance owners wanted after JV logged just 14 minutes on Monday. He's been exceptionally productive when on the court, which enables him to hold standard-league value in just 20 minutes per game. Playing time shouldn't be an issue vs. the Spurs' big frontcourt on Friday, either.

             Lowry avoided punishment for his MLK-Day confrontation with Ben Simmons, which is fortunate for everyone involved. He went 5-of-14 from the field and 4-of-5 from the line tonight, which is a step in the right direction, and it looks like his bruised tailbone is no longer an issue.

             Aside from sporadic DNPs, Ibaka has been a sneaky value this season for 8-cat and 9-cat owners, but he's struggling lately -- in his past four games he's averaging 9.0 points on 37.5% shooting, 4.5 rebounds, 0.8 assists, 0.8 threes, 0.5 blocks and 0.0 steals. If you want blocks, boards and a big man who won't hurt you anywhere, this is a good time to make buy-low offers.

             Awful shooting nights like this can be shrugged off in most points-based leagues, but it's poison for roto owners and can tank the category in weekly head-to-head matchups. He's been worth owning since Reggie Jackson (ankle) went down, so owners should shrug it off. If you're looking for solace, consider that Chris Bosh once shot 1-of-18 in a game for the Heat.

             The Pistons lost their third straight game despite Drummond's big game, and they were undone by inefficiency -- aside from Drummond, they shot 34.2 percent as a team. Detroit is still clinging to the No. 8 seed in the East with a 22-21 record, and the push for a playoff spot should ensure Drummond and other key guys play big minutes in the second half of the season.

             He hasn't skipped a beat since returning from an illness on Saturday, scoring 18 points in 24 minutes on Monday and 16 points in 22 minutes on Saturday. Mirotic looks to be locked in for minutes in the mid-20s and playing next to Lauri Markkanen at times has helped his consistency. He should be owned in standard leagues, but he could be considered as a sell-high player because a trade would likely hurt his value.

             Reggie Bullock shifted to the second unit and this is standard operating procedure for the Pistons -- they were giving up too much in the paint, so Stan Van Gundy went with more size/length after halftime. Bullock has some narrow appeal as a 3-point specialist who doesn't turn the ball over, but Tolliver belongs on the wire.

             Bradley finished the game with 19 points on 8-of-19 shooting, three 3-pointers, three boards, two assists and two steals in 35 minutes. Shooting percentages continue to weigh down his value, at 41.4% field goals and 77.9% free throws, but he's contributing enough points (15.7), threes (2.0) and steals (1.2) to be worth holding most contexts. The real key is his health, of course, and owners should check for updates over the next few days -- Detroit plays on Friday, so we'll consider him questionable for that one.

            Dennis Schroder handed out a career-high-tying 15 assists on Wednesday, adding 13 points with three 3-pointers, three rebounds and two steals in 34 minutes.
        
        
             Schroder shot just 4-of-16 from the field tonight, but he didn't have a single turnover in the Hawks' surprising win vs. New Orleans. They've won two straight games but are still tied with Orlando for the league's worst record (13-31), so owners can rest assured -- the youth movement is alive and well in Atlanta.

            Taurean Prince (dislocated right ring finger) made 3-of-9 shots to score seven points on Wednesday, with one 3-pointer, one rebound, one assist and one block in 36 minutes.
        
        
             Prince was coming off a pair of quiet games in which he averaged 1.5 points in 26.0 minutes, and he's now a combined 4-of-18 from the field in the past three games. The 23-year-old's slump shouldn't scare away owners, though, as he's held top-100 value in 8-cat leagues and is positioned for a big role down the stretch as Atlanta emphasizes player development.

             The Spurs are back to being LMA's team with Kawhi Leonard (quad) out indefinitely. Aldridge gets a massive 7.7 usage rate bump when he's not next to Kawhi this year while he is better on the boards and as an assist man. His fantasy owners should expect him to put up early-round value for the foreseeable future.

             He was 7-of-10 from the field, including his 7-of-8 from beyond the arc. Mills' numbers have trended down since November, so now he'll likely see Mills hit double-digit scoring more often while Kawhi Leonard (quad) is out. His upside still isn't high enough to warrant a pickup in most fantasy leagues.

             Muscala missed over a month with a serious ankle injury, but it's unclear why the Hawks continue to list him on the injury report -- he's healthy and cleared to play. As long as Dewayne Dedmon, John Collins and Miles Plumlee are around, though, there's no reason for owners to bother with Muscala.

            Dewayne Dedmon scored four points on 2-of-9 shooting on Wednesday, but he added 10 rebounds, three assists and one steal before fouling out in 20 minutes.
        
        
             Dedmon sat out nearly six weeks with a stress reaction in his tibia, but he hasn't missed a game since returning on Jan. 8. He was coming off a double-double in 26 minutes vs. the Spurs, and the Hawks have obviously given him the green light to spread the court with 10 attempts from deep in the past three games. He's a solid low-end center who should be owned in all 12-team leagues.

             Belinelli was on the injury report again with a left ankle sprain, but he was never in danger of sitting out. It wouldn't be a surprise if he's still 'probable' for Saturday's game vs. Chicago, but owners can confidently leave him plugged into active lineups.

             While he may not benefit as much as others, Gasol should see an uptick in production while Kawhi Leonard (quad) is out. Perhaps his November averages serve as a fair expectation at 12.1 points, 7.9 boards, 3.4 diems, 1.1 blocks and 1.4 treys. He could start flirting with top-60 value again.

             He was at his best this season when Kawhi Leonard (quad) was out, so Green could start trending up again. Although, we do have to mention that Green is maddeningly inconsistent, so his prospective owners probably won't be in for a smooth ride. He should still be owned in standard leagues.

             He was coming in fairly hot this month, averaging 12.6 points, 3.1 boards and 2.9 treys over his previous eight games. Bertans should be looking at minutes in the 20s most nights with Kawhi Leonard (quad) out indefinitely. He's not going to do too much outside of score and hit treys, so he's only worth a look in very deep leagues.

             The Spurs are really thin on the wing, so Murray should be looking at some minutes at the two. He has the length to earn more run there and he's a terrific rebounder for his position.

            Spencer Dinwiddie made 3-of-13 from the field for nine points with one rebound, two steals and a career-high 13 assists against the Spurs on Wednesday.
        
        
             With no turnovers as well, that makes this game the most assists for a Net without a turnover since Jason Kidd's 13 way back in 2004. Dinwiddie has been superb at the point and he's clearly earned minutes even when D'Angelo Russell returns, which could come on Friday. His per-minute numbers are fantastic with DAR, so Dinwiddie should still be held in all leagues.

             This was the second game in a back-to-back set for the Pelicans, and coach Alvin Gentry basically went with whichever players had gas in the tank. Miller hasn't scored double-digit points in consecutive games since Dec. 1-2 and we're not expecting this to be the start of a hot streak.

             AD recently joined Charles Barkley as the only players with at least 45 points and 15 rebounds in consecutive games, but he couldn't keep it going vs. Atlanta tonight. This was the fewest points he's scored in a game (at least 20 minutes) since Jan. 2015, and fatigue may have been a factor -- this was the second of back-to-back games. Alvin Gentry has said he'd like to rein in AD's minutes, but we'll believe it when we see it.

             Nelson was initially ruled out for this game, but he rejoined the team in Atlanta soon enough to play. There's no reason to think he'll miss more games going forward, although his status is irrelevant in the majority of fantasy leagues. He'd only be on the radar if Rajon Rondo or E'Twaun Moore got hurt.

             He gets to 100 triples faster than any Net in the team's history with his 41 games topping Deron Williams' 44 back in 2011-12. Crabbe also hit 20 points for the sixth time this season to match his entire output last season -- his boards matched a career-high, too. Good game aside, Crabbe may have a tougher time earning minutes because D'Angelo Russell returning will make the wing rotation a bit of a mess.

             In case you missed it, he has a sprain and will get an MRI on Thursday. Bell said he thought he broke something in his foot, but this is looking like it'll be a bad sprain to keep him out for multiple games. He was actually asked about returning this season and said he's confident he'll be back ""sooner rather than later."" If you were considering dropping him before this injury, you may want to do so now. Kevon Looney could step up for the short term until Draymond Green (shoulder) gets back.

             His improvement at backup point guard is going to be key for how the Nets handle their rotation. Coach Kenny Atkinson has said he'd like to play D'Angelo Russell next to Spencer Dinwiddie, which means LeVert should continue as the backup one. Although, it may be harder for him to close games, so his owners may want to expect a dip in production. He should still be held in standard leagues, though.

If you've been using him in a deeper league, you may want to be ready to look for another player to add.

             The Nets went with some bigger lineups up front to try to combat the size of the Spurs frontcourt, so that somewhat explains the light playing time. Foul trouble also cut Hollis-Jefferson's minutes on Monday with just 26 minutes, so he's had two games in a row below his season average for playing time. We're not worried about him and he should be a mid-round guy going forward.

             The Hornets won a second straight game on the strength of their offense, which poured in 77 points in the first half alone. Dwight was a model of efficiency, too, making 7-of-13 FGs and 4-of-5 FTs tonight. His final free throws came when Washington chose him to shoot in place of Michael Carter-Williams (ejection), and he drained them both. Fantasy owners who gambled on the 32-year-old have been richly rewarded this season.

            Michael Carter-Williams was ejected late in Wednesday's game, finishing with three points, five assists, three rebounds and one block in 15 minutes.
        
        
             MCW was upset with Jason Smith and appeared to intentionally trip him, then charged at Smith while he was down (see link below for video of the incident). He could face a suspension and deep-league owners should confirm his status prior to Saturday's game vs. the Heat. If he does miss any time, Jeremy Lamb, Julyan Stone and Malik Monk would pick up the slack.

            Kris Dunn (face) went to the locker room in the fourth quarter after a bad fall.
        
        
             He made a breakaway layup, but the momentum pulled him off the rim and put his body horizontal. Dunn landed on his face and it looked like he may have lost a tooth. He'll certainly be getting checked for a concussion here and he's almost certainly out for the rest of the game, but he was able to walk to the locker room under his own power. Dunn finished with 16 point, five rebounds, four assists, three steals and one 3-pointer in 30 minutes.

             It's being called a sprain to his metacarpal-phalangeal joint, which is basically where the pinkie meets the palm. The Lakers are down big in the fourth, so Kuzma not returning isn't really big news. He checked out with seven points, one rebound, two assists, one steal and one 3-pointer in 23 minutes. We should get an update after the game or tomorrow, but expect Kuzma to be day-to-day for now.

             Frazier has fallen out of the rotation with Tomas Satoransky (six points, seven assists) taking over the backup point guard job. He was in during garbage time but didn't last long, and most fantasy owners can continue to ignore him.

             In fairness to Gortat, his minutes were down tonight because the Wizards were getting blown out. He's shown signs of life in January and was averaging 11.4 points, 9.2 boards and 1.0 blocks in his previous five games, so this dud is nothing to worry about.

             Scott added three assists, two rebounds and one steal, and this was a welcome surprise for anyone deploying him in DFS or deep leagues. He hadn't played more than 18 minutes in a game this month, prior to tonight's blowout, and hasn't been worth owning since a torrid stretch in mid-December. Leave him on the wire.

             This was a blowout and the Wizards' starters sat down the stretch, but Porter's quiet game is part of a disturbing trend. He's scored double-digit points twice in the past eight games, and both coach Scott Brooks and John Wall called him out this week. ""The bottom line is Otto needs to get himself open and be ready to catch and shoot and get more shots,"" said Brooks. Wall added that he wants his teammate to be more ""aggressive,"" and fantasy owners can only hope he gets the message.

He committed four fouls during his limited time on the court, but the Wizards also rested starters at the end of a blowout tonight. Expect better vs. Detroit on Friday.

We'll try to figure out the pattern the Kings, but all bets are off on who rests until further notice. Randolph is a drop candidate in shallower leagues.

             It'll be Josh Hart starting the second half at shooting guard. KCP tried to give it a go in warmups before the third quarter, but he didn't feel right. It's worth a mention KCP had a right Achilles issue back in 2015, so there's a very good chance he needs to miss time. Hart is worth a speculative add in deep leagues.

             In case you missed it, he is not going to play tonight. Murray took a shot to his face on Tuesday, but he was able to return to the game. There's a very good chance he did play after he suffered the blow to his head, so expect the Nuggets to be extra cautious. Murray will miss his first NBA game tonight and Will Barton will be running the point in the first unit. Emmanuel Mudiay should be in the rotation off the bench.

            Jordan Bell (left ankle) will not return on Wednesday against the Bulls.
        
        
             The good news is X-rays were negative, but he will have an MRI on Thursday.  It's also good news that it's not knee related, but there's a good chance Bell won't be ready to go this weekend. If he is out, Kevon Looney should fill some extra minutes until Draymond Green (shoulder) can return.

            Jordan Bell went to the locker room in the first quarter on Wednesday.
        
        
             It was on the first play of the game as Robin Lopez dunked on him. Bell's left leg landed awkwardly and he wasn't able to put weight on his leg as he was helped off the court. He was put in a wheelchair and was taken back to the locker room for more evaluation. He's likely out for the night and hopefully he won't require too much time off. Kevon Looney replaced him.

Clarkson is the most attractive fantasy target out of this group.

             This is a small surprise with the Clippers getting off light. Griffin can be put into all lineups and may actually be a strong DFS play against the Nuggets tonight.

Harden is expected to make it back to the court on Thursday, and he'll be dealing with a 24-25 minute limit.

            The NBA is suspending Trevor Ariza and Gerald Green two games for aggressively entering Clippers locker room.
        
        
             He was reportedly the ""most aggressive"" of the team, so a suspension was likely to happen here. These two won't be playing on Thursday against the Wolves or Saturday against the Warriors in a primetime matchup. The Rockets did get Luc Mbah a Moute back, so he'll be an important piece in the rotation. Expect for P.J. Tucker to also see a slight bump in playing time, as well.

             Leonard is out indefinitely, but it does sound like he's looking at an extended time off. Considering how careful the Spurs were with him before and how he's only played nine games, it's fair to guess he's not going to play before the All-Star Game. His owners have to hold him and trading for him isn't the worst idea, assuming you're not giving up an elite player. Kyle Anderson is worth an add in 12-team leagues.

Expect to see more Jarell Martin, as well.

Joining Morris in the starting five will be John Wall, Bradley Beal, Otto Porter and Marcin Gortat.

             Russell will not play Wednesday vs. the Spurs, but maybe he'll be able to get back to the court for Friday's game against the Heat. We'll have a better idea on his status for Friday's game based on his activity level at practices, but he recently was cleared to go through 5-on-5 work, so there aren't many hurdles left to clear. He'll likely be working with a minutes limit upon his return, but he offers enough upside to warrant ownership in all leagues at this point.

Winslow said he's ""comfortable"" with playing there, or the Heat could go with Derrick Jones Jr. or Derrick Walton Jr. to start. Wayne Ellington also benefits in a big way and should be firing away from deep.

            Jamal Murray (concussion protocol) will not play against the Clippers on Wednesday.
        
        
             The injury happened on Tuesday night and Murray was diagnosed with a facial contusion. He did return to the game in the fourth, but the team monitored him through the night and Wednesday morning. Murray does not have a timetable to return, but hopefully this is more of a day-to-day issue. With him out, that should mean Emmanuel Mudiay gets in the rotation again while Will Barton plays more PG. That should also open up minutes for Torrey Craig and Malik Beasley.RotoGrinders.com Daily Slant: Believe it or not, with Millsap/Murray and non-active Nuggets off the floor, Emmanuel Mudiay actually leads the team in usage at 25.9% (0.85 FPPM). While the majority of that production came with the second-unit against back-ups, Mudiay does enter the DFS discussion but remains a low-floor/high-ceiling option. Will Barton is the safer target with a higher ceiling, as he figures to pick up ball-handling duties.

             If Harden goes through Wednesday practice without an issue, he will be probable to face the Wolves on Thursday. Harden suffered his injury on Dec. 31, and it's been mostly positive news since he went down. His return means Gerald Green takes a big hit while Eric Gordon moves to the bench.

             Just when it looked like Labissiere was going to get minutes on a regular basis, he has to sit out as the Kings turn to their youth. Coach Dave Joerger said he's expected to rest 2-3 veterans per game, but maybe this time Zach Randolph and Kosta Koufos suit up. On the other hand, the Kings could turn to Georgios Papagiannis or run more small-ball lineups, but either way Z-Bo and Koufos can't be trusted. Willie Cauley-Stein is really the only reliable Kings big these days.

Plus, his upside won't be very high even if he can make it back.

             He is under the weather, but the Celtics likely won't need the Dancing Bear anyway.

             He is also going to be questionable to play against the 76ers on Thursday. Irving played a season-high 41 minutes on Tuesday, and he's also in a bad slump to start 2018 at just 35.4 FG% in those five games. If he can't go, Terry Rozier and Shane Larkin figure to pick up the most playing time. Hopefully, he is only being held out of practice as a precaution.

             ""It hasn't responded the way we wanted it to,"" said coach Gregg Popovich. ""You try to react to how he feels after the games he's played in a little bit. It just hasn't gone as well as we've wanted it to. So we're going to stop him for an indefinite period  I don't know how long that will be  to get more strength and hopefully get him back on the court."" This is very concerning given he's only appeared in nine games this season, and Pop's quote seems to imply there's a chance he might not be back this season. Owners in leagues that don't offer an IR-spot have a tough decision to make.

             Brown said that Bayless will be ""first up"" to fill Redick's spot, and said he'll also try to find more minutes for guys like Timothe Luwawu and Justin Anderson. As a starter this season, Bayless owns averages of 11.0 points, 2.1 triples and 1.5 assists per contest on 44.9% shooting, so he could be someone to think about as a deep league streamer on Thursday.

Stay tuned.

             This will be Holmes second straight game on the sidelines due to the stomach bug, which will translate to more minutes for Trevor Booker and Amir Johnson. Holmes is only worth owning in deep leagues as a Joel Embiid-handcuff.

JaMychal Green would also spend more time at the five than usual. Stay tuned.

             With Zach LaVine back, and Kris Dunn excelling at point guard, Grant has become an expendable piece for the Bulls. They also would probably like to get a good look at Cameron Payne (foot) after the All-Star break, and moving Grant would make it easier to do that. It's unlikely Grant will be much more than a backup regardless of where he winds up, so the name on the jersey won't have much impact on his status as a non-option in fantasy hoops.

Smith reported something accurately, so we wouldn't read to much into this claim from his anonymous sources, as clicks and headlines tend to take precedence over actual reporting when it comes to Stephen A. The Clippers are currently sitting on the No. 7 seed out West, and as long as they're in the playoff hunt, they'll be much less likely to move Jordan.

Porzingis is adjusting to being the No. 1 guy in the offense, but with Tim Hardaway Jr. back, and Porzingis being more selective with his shots, his shooting percentages should start to trend upward.

            J.J. Barea (groin) is hopeful that he'll be able to get back to the court for Saturday's game in Portland.
        
        
             Barea missed Tuesday's game due to the groin issue, but said he ""should be okay,"" and he'll have had a full week off going into Saturday's game so maybe he'll be able to get back out there. If Barea is able to return to the court, Devin Harris' minutes will take a hit.

            Otto Porter said he's been out of rhythm since returning from the one-game absence last week.
        
        
             ""I know I've only been out a [game], but I'm trying to slowly get back mentally and physically to where I was,"" Porter said. ""I'm just trying to get back into rhythm."" Over the past seven games, Porter has averaged just 8.9 points per game on 37.7% shooting, so he's certainly struggling at the moment. Head coach Scott Brooks hinted that he'll run some more plays for Porter, but also said that Porter will need to be more aggressive in seeking out his own shot.

             While it's true he's a must-start any time the Blazers are without Damian Lillard, he's actually managed to stay afloat with Lillard back. He returned to action four games ago and Napier has averaged 11.5 points, 2.8 rebounds, 4.0 assists, 1.0 steals and 1.5 3-pointers over that stretch, despite sitting out the entire second half on Sunday with the back problem. Those aren't must-own numbers and he's tough to trust with Lillard healthy, but he might be worth grabbing, especially as a Lillard insurance policy.

             The six triples tied his season high, as he did it previously on Nov. 5, and CJM's had it on cruise control all season, scoring in single figures just one time. He's returning solid fourth-round fantasy value this season, but he's on the rise, putting up his best numbers of the season in January.

             He played the opening six minutes of the game but was then benched for the rest of the first half, despite not being in foul trouble. His minutes got back on track in the second half, but it is concerning that he's only played 22 and 20 minutes in each of his last two games. Nurkic will look to get back on track against the Pacers on Thursday, and then has a dream matchup against the Mavericks on Saturday. Dallas gets torched by opposing centers every night and Nikola Jokic put them on blast for 29 points, 18 rebounds, seven assists, two steals and a block tonight.

Warren (foot) missed another game, so Daniels stepped up when coach Jay Triano called his name. The Suns only have one more game this week and it's not until Friday, so there's no reason to pick up Daniels in most leagues.

             The Suns had a big fourth quarter (39-26) but still lost by seven, while Aminu bounced back after a quiet game on Sunday, when he had just six points, seven rebounds, a block and zero 3-pointers. Aminu is bouncing around on a lot of waiver wires, but he's quietly averaging 11 points, 7.4 rebounds, 1.2 steals and 2.2 3-pointers over his last five games. He's hit at least one 3-pointer in eight of his nine January games and if you need a big man who can steal and hit 3-pointers, Aminu seems to be coming on after a rather quiet second half of December.

He did everything he could to give the Suns a chance with 21 points in the fourth quarter, but it wasn't enough as they dropped their third straight game. He finished 14-of-29 from the field and hit all 10 of his free throws with eight assists, six rebounds, two steals, one block and five triples, becoming the first Phoenix Sun to record 43+ points and 8+ assists since Stephon Marbury in 2003. He's quickly becoming one of the top shooting guards in the NBA.

             The Nuggets needed a spark after losing four out of their previous five games, so Barton delivered. Maybe it was a matchup move, but it would make sense for Denver to go back to this lineup on Wednesday vs. the Clippers, especially if DeAndre Jordan (ankle) is out.

            Devin Harris came off the bench for 16 points, one assist and four 3-pointers on 5-of-11 shooting Tuesday, in just 18 minutes of action.
        
        
             J.J. Barea (groin) sat this one out, moving Yogi Ferrell to the bench and freeing up some room for Harris to work. This was Harris' best game in January, but he's only getting 18 minutes a night, which isn't enough for him to be owned in fantasy.

            Yogi Ferrell moved to the bench with J.J. Barea out (groin) on Tuesday and hit 5-of-10 shots and a 3-pointer for 13 points, two rebounds, seven assists and a steal in 35 minutes off the bench.
        
        
             The Mavs started Maxi Kleber, who did nothing, and Ferrell was instrumental in helping the Mavs win the fourth quarter 33-19 and giving his team a chance to win the game. Ferrell's generally more fun to use when he's starting, but has scored in double figures in four straight games. If you picked him up and used him this week, we're at the halfway mark, with Dallas finishing their week on Saturday against the Blazers.

            Gary Harris was a beast in Tuesday's win over Dallas, racking up 25 points, four assists, four steals, one block and three triples.
        
        
             Harris was 8th in the NBA in deflections (133) prior to Tuesday and was everywhere on the defensive end again tonight. He did miss a pair of free throws late, but Harris, Will Barton and Nikola Jokic got the Nuggets back on track with just their second win in their last six games. Harris finished 8-of-17 from the field and 6-of-8 from the line and is locked in as a borderline early-round value in category leagues.

            Dennis Smith Jr. hit 11-of-18 shots and 3-of-3 free throws for 25 points, two rebounds, five assists and a steal in 31 minutes of Tuesday's 105-102 loss to the Nuggets.
        
        
             Smith helped lead a fourth-quarter comeback when Dallas outscored Denver 33-19, but came up just short. DSJ had a big three-point play near the end that cut the lead to one when he hit the free throw, but he also had a costly late turnover, as well. DSJ is playing very well right now, averaging 18.8 points, 3.2 rebounds, 4.4 assists, 1.2 steals, 0.6 blocks and 1.2 3-pointers on 43 percent shooting over his last five, and has hit 16-of-17 free throws in his last four. He's still learning how to play, but has scored at least 20 points in three of his last four games. Make sure he's in your lineup if Dallas is playing.

            Nikola Jokic dominated in a 105-102 win over the Mavericks on Tuesday, scoring 29 points with a season-high 18 rebounds, seven assists, one block and two steals in 33 minutes.
        
        
             The matchup was obviously favorable, but the big takeaway from the game was that Jokic didn't log any minutes next to Mason Plumlee -- Jokic's advanced stats are better across the board when Plumlee is off the floor and he's clearly more comfortable playing all his minutes at the five. The Denver offense was running through him even more than usual tonight and he grabbed nine offensive rebounds, finishing 11-of-23 from the field and 7-of-10 from the line. His owners will be hoping that coach Malone sticks with this rotation on Wednesday vs. the Clippers.

            Dirk Nowitzki played just 23 minutes and hit 3-of-5 shots for six points, four rebounds and a steal in Tuesday's 105-102 loss to the Nuggets.
        
        
             Nikola Jokic destroyed the center-less Macs tonight and Dallas made their big comeback in the fourth quarter with Dirk on the bench. Dirk has been a pleasant surprise this season, but has scored six or fewer points in three of his last five games. While it's possible he's running out of gas, the fact that he's playing a lot of center for Dallas may also be taking its toll. He'll try to bounce back against Jusuf Nurkic and the Blazers on Saturday, which should be interesting after Nurkic was benched for a big part of Tuesdays' Blazers' game.

             Tatum missed a practice over the weekend after tweaking his knee last week vs. Philly, but all the test results came back clean. ""It feels a lot better. I just tweaked it in the game in London, and the long plane ride it got a little stiff,"" he said. ""We had a few days off of practice, I mean, off until our next game. So they just told me to rest the other day at practice."" He's been one of the most consistent rookies this season and is flirting with top-50 value in standard 9-category leagues, and it doesn't sound like this knee injury is going to linger.

             He's been banged up lately with a sore knee and sore calf, but he's had plenty of time off to rest and it's a great sign that he played 38 minutes tonight. Horford hit four 3-pointers for the eighth time of his career in the loss, adding nine rebounds, six assists, one steal and one block. The Celtics were bullied by Anthony Davis tonight and Horford will have his hands full again on Thursday vs. Joel Embiid and the 76ers.

             This was Boston's second game in the last 10 days, but the well-rested Irving got off to a slow start before erupting with a 16-point third quarter. He finished just 8-of-24 from the field and 6-of-7 from the line with an uncharacteristic six turnovers -- this was his third game of the season with that many. Expect a more efficient game on Thursday vs. Philly.

             The 15 points were the most he's scored in January, but he's worth keeping an eye on right now, averaging just under 26 minutes a game over his last four with Jameer Nelson (personal) sidelined. He's not doing all that much with the sudden boost in playing time though, averaging just 8.8 points, 3.8 rebounds and 1.3 assists over that stretch, without many steals or 3-pointers. Just put him on your watch list in deep leagues in case the minutes stick in the mid-20s going forward.

             Boogie wasn't all that efficient tonight and the seven turnovers, compared to just one for Anthony Davis, have been an issue all season. He's struggling with his shot right now, hitting just 11-of-36 over his last two games, but once they start falling again, look out. The 5.4 turnovers over his last five games are annoying and right on course, as he's averaging 5.0 per game on the season. Despite the negatives, he's playing at first-round value this season and his shot should start falling soon.

             This wasn't a season-high performance for AD, as he went off for 48 points and 17 rebounds on Sunday against the Knicks. Davis has been crazy good for three straight games, as well as the whole season, and is averaging 43 points, 14 rebounds, 1.7 steals and 2.3 blocks over his last three. Unfortunately, he's also played 45, 50 and 41 minutes in each of those games and big minutes are not what AD's owners need from him. You have to wonder if there's a chance he sits on Wednesday night against the Hawks. The good news is he looks fully healthy and energized, and even rammed home a dunk after the buzzer as an exclamation point tonight.

            Jimmy Butler hit 11-of-22 shots and two 3-pointers for 28 points, seven rebounds, four assists, five steals and two blocks in Tuesday's loss to the Magic.
        
        
             On top of all that, he also made all four of his free throws and didn't have a single turnover. After a slow start to the season, Butler has played like a premier NBA shooting guard and worked his way up to the No. 9 fantasy player according to Basketballmonster.com. Karl-Anthony Towns had a 15 & 12 double-double with three blocks, but the Wolves didn't get much out of Andrew Wiggins on a night Evan Fournier went crazy for the Magic.

             He played a total of 20 minutes this season prior to Tuesday, but coach Frank Vogel gave him a look with Marreese Speights (personal) out and he made a big impression. It's possible that the Magic will give him another chance even when Speights returns since this is becoming a lost season anyways, so put him on your watch list if you need a big man. We'll let you know if he keeps it going on Thursday vs. the Cavaliers.

             Teague was coming off a big game against Portland on Sunday when he had 22 points and eight assists, but returned to form tonight. Teague hasn't shot the ball particularly well since returning from his knee injury, but then again, he's only played in four games after missing seven straight with the injury. He should be nearing 100 percent health for the second half of the season.

             He also matched a career-high with six triples, adding three assists and two rebounds in 35 minutes. Fournier is off to a slow start in January with averages of 14.0 points, 2.8 rebounds, 2.3 assists, 0.7 steals and 1.3 triples prior to tonight, so hopefully this performance will get him going. He gets a matchup with the Cavaliers on Thursday, a team that has allowed 118+ points in four out of their last five games.

             He probably would have done even more, but he ended up fouling out before it was over. The 18 points are the most he's scored in January, but he's been playing really well, scoring in double digits in five of his last six games while doing some nice rebounding. He's not a huge shot blocker, nor does he steal the ball a lot, but he does have five steals over his last two games. He's been worth a sixth-round pick this season and is putting the ball in the basket right now.

             That's his 17th career game with five or more blocks and his second of the season (he also had five blocks on Dec. 26). Biyombo has been dominant over his last three games with 15.0 points, 12.6 rebounds and 2.3 blocks, and while he'll continue to eat while Nikola Vucevic (hand) is out, the Magic will have a tough decision on their hands around the trade deadline -- Vucevic is on the books for $12.7 million next season and could be a trade candidate with Orlando looking at another lost season.

             All we have to work with is the injury report, so we don't know any details on the severity or whether or not he practiced on Tuesday. If Labissiere can't go, we should see Zach Randolph play a lot of minutes after he was rested in his last outing. The Kings are trying to get their younger guys more playing time, so keep an eye on the second-year big man.

             Both players were chirping at each other for a few minutes, but Afflalo started swinging when the two were competing for a rebound. Afflalo is likely looking at a suspension, but he shouldn't be owned in fantasy leagues anyways. While he's out, Wes Iwundu and Mario Hezonja could pick up some extra minutes.

             Curry has yet to appear in a game this season, and it sounds like he won't make his debut anytime soon. He'll first need to be cleared for contact, and then begin practicing with the team before he gets close to game action. He should be left on the waiver wire in all re-draft leagues.

A suspension will likely follow for at least one of these guys following Monday's madness, and this report from Woj indicates that Ariza could be the fall man.

I jammed it and it's been a little swollen."" The Spurs are notoriously cautious with their injured players, so it certainly wouldn't be surprised if Gasol was sidelined on Wednesday. If Gasol is ruled out, Davis Bertans and Joffrey Lauvergne would likely pick up most of his minutes. Bertans would be the more attractive streaming option and could be worth a look as a risky DFS punt.

             Nelson did not play Sunday and was initially ruled out of Tuesday's contest. However, the Pelicans announced Tuesday evening that he is now back with the team. Yet, this has only a minimal fantasy impact, as Nelson is averaging just 12.6 minutes per game in January. He should be left on waivers.

             Jackson played well in his previous start sans Warren, scoring a career-high 21 points to go with six boards, three dimes and two triples in 30 minutes of floor time, so he's someone to consider in DFS with what should be a favorable and uptempo matchup with the Trail Blazers.RotoGrinders.com Daily Slant: With all inactive/non-rotation members off the floor - including Warren and Chriss, who were both ruled out today - Jackson is averaging 0.93 fantasy points per minute with a very solid 28.2% usage rate, making him an attractive target in all DFS formats. Dragan Bender also appears to be locked into at least 28-30 minutes of court time, making him a viable bounce back candidate.

The same can be said about Iguodala. If both these guys are out, there minutes will be divvied up between Kevin Durant, David West, Omri Casspi and Jordan Bell.

That said, Chriss was playing so well prior to going down, we'd advise trying to hang on in most leagues. With Chriss and Warren unavailable on Tuesday, Josh Jackson figures to earn another start with Devin Booker doing the heavy lifting on offense. Dragan Bender will also get another start, and he's someone to think about as a streamer.

Check back for another update following Wednesday morning's shootaround.

            Lonzo Ball (knee) is doubtful to play Wednesday vs. the Thunder.
        
        
             Ball wasn't able to practice on Tuesday and head coach Luke Walton said he didn't expect Ball to be able to get out there on Wednesday night, so the doubtful tag confirms the obvious. Tyler Ennis figures to earn another start on Wednesday if Ball sits, and there will be more minutes available for guys like Josh Hart and Jordan Clarkson.

             Nance played through the hip issue on Monday, but it may have gotten worse overnight. We'll have a better idea on his status following Wednesday morning's shootaround, but if he does need to hit the sidelines, Kyle Kuzma and Julius Randle would pick up most of his minutes. Stay tuned.

             Russell did not practice on Tuesday, but he'll be active at Wednesday morning's shootaround. He recently went through a 5-on-5 scrimmage with Brooklyn's G-League affiliate, so he has to be close. His next opportunity to get out there will be Friday against Miami. Allen Crabbe could head back to the second unit once Russell gets back to the court, and Caris LeVert's value could take a hit.

             Kaminsky sprained his right ankle during the fourth quarter of Monday's win over the Pistons, and he was in a good amount of pain after the injury, so it wouldn't be shocking to see him sit out Wednesday's game. We should have another update following Wednesday morning's shootaround, but if he's out, Marvin Williams and Dwight Howard would likely split most of his minutes. Johnny O'Bryant could also get into the rotation, but he wouldn't be a fantasy target.

             Ingram, who was held out of Monday's loss to Memphis, did admit he was ""a little sore,"" but was able to sprint and cut on his ankle in Tuesday's practice. The Lakers will determine Ingram's status for Wednesday's game based upon how the ankle responds to Tuesday's activity, but it's worth noting that head coach Luke Walton also said he expects Ingram to play. If he is able to get back out there, Josh Hart would get bumped back to the bench.

             This is the first time Kennard has popped up on the injury report due to a thumb issue. In fact, he has yet to miss a game due to injury this season and has played over 22 minutes in each of the Pistons last two contests. Avery Bradley (groin) and Stanley Johnson (hip) are also listed as questionable, which could leave the Pistons with little depth on Wednesday. We should have an update on the status of all three players after Wednesday morning's shootaround.

             This is concerning news, as Bradley was sidelined for seven straight games from mid-December through early January due to a right groin strain. Hopefully, this is more of a maintenance day off for Bradley, as opposed to a re-aggravation. We'll have to wait for a clear update from coach Stan Van Gundy before jumping to conclusions. Luke Kennard (thumb) and Stanley Johnson (hip) are also questionable for Wednesday, which means Detroit may be shorthanded at SG and on the wing.

Fortunately, VanVleet said he was feeling better on Tuesday. We'll still consider him questionable for Wednesday's game vs. Detroit. If VanVleet is unable to play, Delon Wright would soak up additional minutes off the Raptors bench.

            Brandon Ingram (ankle) is being listed as questionable for Wednesday's game against the Thunder.
        
        
             Ingram was able to practice in full on Tuesday and said he expects to be back on the court on Wednesday night, and head coach Luke Walton echoed a similar sentiment, so he feels a bit closer to probable. Check back for another update following Wednesday morning's shootaround.

            Lonzo Ball (knee) is doubtful to play Wednesday vs. the Thunder.
        
        
             Ball wasn't able to practice on Tuesday and head coach Luke Walton said he didn't expect Ball to be able to get out there on Wednesday night, so the doubtful tag confirms the obvious. Tyler Ennis figures to earn another start on Wednesday if Ball sits, and there will be more minutes available for guys like Josh Hart and Jordan Clarkson.

             Nance played through the hip issue on Monday, but it may have gotten worse overnight. We'll have a better idea on his status following Wednesday morning's shootaround, but if he does need to hit the sidelines, Kyle Kuzma and Julius Randle would pick up most of his minutes. Stay tuned.

             The Thunder just did some light shooting and watched film on Tuesday, so this isn't much of an update. We'll have a better idea on Roberson's status for tomorrow's game based on his activity level at Wednesday morning's shootaround, but if he's out again, Terrance Ferguson will get another start.

             Russell did not practice on Tuesday, but he'll be active at Wednesday morning's shootaround. He recently went through a 5-on-5 scrimmage with Brooklyn's G-League affiliate, so he has to be close. His next opportunity to get out there will be Friday against Miami. Allen Crabbe could head back to the second unit once Russell gets back to the court, and Caris LeVert's value could take a hit.

             Kaminsky sprained his right ankle during the fourth quarter of Monday's win over the Pistons, and he was in a good amount of pain after the injury, so it wouldn't be shocking to see him sit out Wednesday's game. We should have another update following Wednesday morning's shootaround, but if he's out, Marvin Williams and Dwight Howard would likely split most of his minutes. Johnny O'Bryant could also get into the rotation, but he wouldn't be a fantasy target.

             Ingram, who was held out of Monday's loss to Memphis, did admit he was ""a little sore,"" but was able to sprint and cut on his ankle in Tuesday's practice. The Lakers will determine Ingram's status for Wednesday's game based upon how the ankle responds to Tuesday's activity, but it's worth noting that head coach Luke Walton also said he expects Ingram to play. If he is able to get back out there, Josh Hart would get bumped back to the bench.

             This is the first time Kennard has popped up on the injury report due to a thumb issue. In fact, he has yet to miss a game due to injury this season and has played over 22 minutes in each of the Pistons last two contests. Avery Bradley (groin) and Stanley Johnson (hip) are also listed as questionable, which could leave the Pistons with little depth on Wednesday. We should have an update on the status of all three players after Wednesday morning's shootaround.

             This is concerning news, as Bradley was sidelined for seven straight games from mid-December through early January due to a right groin strain. Hopefully, this is more of a maintenance day off for Bradley, as opposed to a re-aggravation. We'll have to wait for a clear update from coach Stan Van Gundy before jumping to conclusions. Luke Kennard (thumb) and Stanley Johnson (hip) are also questionable for Wednesday, which means Detroit may be shorthanded at SG and on the wing.

             VanVleet injured his right knee on a layup attempt in Monday's game vs. the Sixers. He limped off the floor and was unable to return to the contest. Fortunately, VanVleet said he was feeling better on Tuesday. We'll still consider him questionable for Wednesday's game vs. Detroit. If VanVleet is unable to play, Delon Wright would soak up additional minutes off the Raptors bench.
