# DEEP LEARNING: Word Embeddings for NBA News

The aim of this work is studying and understanding how word embeddings work and how much information one can extract from them when used in a very specific context. Therefore, in this implementation we will try to extract information from NBA basketball news, with no other information than raw text. The idea is studying if the embedding, without prior information, is able to relate and group together concepts like players, teams, actions of the game, etc.
