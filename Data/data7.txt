            Victor Oladipo torched the Jazz for 28 points, six rebounds, six assists, two steals, five 3-pointers and just one turnover in Monday's easy 109-94 win over the Jazz.
        
        
             All-Star voting ends tonight and it's possible Dipo picked up some more votes with this strong line. He simply has to make the All-Star team this year as one of the East's best players and he's the ninth most valuable fantasy player this season in nine-cat. His owners suffered through a rough four-game stretch in early January when he was hurt, but all is forgiven after one of his best games since returning action six games ago.

             The game was a blowout, just like Sunday's win over Phoenix, so the Pacers let Joseph play while giving Darren Collison a bit of a rest. Joseph has played very well in his last two games, but the Pacers probably won't be blowing people out of the gym on a regular basis. In fact, they'll get a tough test on Thursday night at Portland, so look for Joseph to cool off in that one.

             No, it wasn't as good as his 9-of-11 shooting performance on Friday when he scored 22 points with a fun stat line, but it wasn't all that bad either. Scoring is just one category, so don't let tonight's six points scare you away from Collison. He's the only point guard of choice in Indy and this game was a blowout.

             He'd been out since Dec. 9 with a knee injury and got back to it tonight. Had the Pacers not blown the game open in the third quarter, Neto may not have seen as many minutes, but as long as Ricky Rubio, who was a disaster tonight, is healthy, it's hard to see Neto making any fantasy noise.

             Rubio showed signs of life last Wednesday with 21 points and a fun stat line, and had seven points, seven rebounds, four assists, a 3-pointer and a block in his previous game, but Monday was a disaster. The Jazz turned to Raul Neto and Alec Burks for a chunk of minutes tonight after the Pacers blew the game open in the third quarter. Some of us still believe Rubio can bounce back for a big second half like he did last year, but then again, others of us think those people should have their heads examined. While a two-point game isn't really surprising for Rubio, this was the first time this season he didn't record a single assist. Unfortunately, some of that has to do with his teammates. If he doesn't get this turned around against the Kings on Wednesday, Rubio's going to start showing up on a lot of waiver wires.

            Joe Ingles missed his only shot and played just 20 minutes on Monday, failing to score against the Pacers.
        
        
             He only had an assist, a steal and two turnovers on the night, so he actually hurt owners with negative points if you used him in some leagues. He's really tailed off lately, averaging 6.0 points, 4.8 rebounds, 4.6 assists, 1.2 steals and 1.0 3-pointers on 35 percent shooting over his last five games. He was returning late eighth-round fantasy value on the season coming into tonight's game, according to Basketballmonster.com, but given how badly he's struggling, you can probably find a more exciting free agent out there. Just don't be surprised if he gets it turned around sooner than later.

Hield's path to minutes is getting wider, so he could have a strong finish to the season.

             Vince Carter was a DNP-CD, and after the game coach Dave Joerger said he's going to be resting two veterans in every game -- that means Garrett Temple is another wing player who could be rested.

             He also had just three turnovers, and basically outplayed LeBron James across the board tonight, even though James had a pretty big game himself. Durant crushed him in free throw shooting and turnovers, which is what makes Durant a more popular player to own in fantasy than James. Durant simply won't hurt you anywhere.

             This would have been his third triple-double of the season and it feels like they're tougher to come by across the league this season.

             Wade rested on Friday against the Pacers and was probably dropped in a lot of leagues. And after tonight's lackluster performance, and more rest-DNPs coming, he's not going to be a very popular pickup in fantasy leagues.

             Maybe we should start calling him the 'Rust Guy' instead of the 'Pizza Guy,' as it's going to take him a minute to shake off the rust after missing seven months with his hip injury. The good news is that he played 32 minutes and hasn't had any issues with the hip, so it should only be a matter of time before he gets the ship righted.

Expect more minutes for guys like Buddy Hield and Bogdan Bogdanovic at Carter's expense.

             It apparently started on Monday vs. the Thunder, as Zach Randolph and Vince Carter both picked up DNP-CDs without any warning from the coaching staff or reporters. The Kings are going to focus on their younger players going forward, so in addition to Z-Bo and Carter, George Hill, Garrett Temple and Kosta Koufos are going to be constant threats for rest days.

             James didn't miss many shots tonight, but the Cavaliers still managed to go on a 1-of-16 shooting stretch in the second half, much of which he was on the bench for. The Cavs could never recover and are still looking for answers, dropping their fourth straight games and fifth in their last sixth. James still looks like a 25-year-old kid out there and is killing it for his fantasy owners (minus the free throws and turnovers), but the Cavaliers are still trying to find their groove.

He finished 7-of-17 from the field and 3-of-4 from the line, and now he gets a matchup with his hometown Lakers on Wednesday.

             Westbrook thought he was fouled on a layup attempt and completely lost it on the refs, picking up a double technical in the process. He'll be fined by the NBA, but his fantasy owners don't have to worry about a suspension. He finished 8-of-14 from the field, but hit just 3-of-7 from the line in what was a very inefficient night. This was the 8th game of his career with 10 or more turnovers, but he should have a monster night against the Lakers on Wednesday to make up for it.

"Tyreke Evans

            Tyreke Evans had 15 points, nine rebounds, 12 assists, a steal and a 3-pointer in 36 minutes of Monday's 123-114 win over the Lakers.
        
        
             He looked great again, as usual, and just missed a triple-double when teammate JaMychal Green stole a late rebound from him. Evans has had an awesome bounce-back season and should be owned and started everywhere, but things could change for him if he's traded before the deadline. If you've been thinking about selling high on him and are worried about him being traded to an unfavorable situation, the sell-high window is wide open right now.

             That ties his season high in scoring, as he's had two other 19-point games this season, but they came early. He had scored a grand total of 15 points in his previous three games and doesn't get many rebounds, assists, blocks or steals. He belongs on waivers in most leagues, unless he's going to start scoring like this on a regular basis.

             Green went off for 20 points, 14 rebounds, two steals and a block last Wednesday, then had a five-point dud on Friday before playing fairly well today. He's not going to do much besides score and rebound, and he doesn't exactly destroy those categories, but he's playing well enough to be given a look in most leagues if you're desperate for a big man.

             There's not much to say here. This is what Kuzma does, although he did get a lot more run than Julius Randle tonight and got some extra touches with Brandon Ingram and Lonzo Ball in street clothes. Kuzma looks like the steal of the NBA Draft and one of the waiver-wire pickups of the year in fantasy leagues where he went undrafted.

             He hit 6-of-9 shots and owners might want to monitor him going forward, as he was in a lot of pain after banging hips with Deyonte Davis and was wearing a huge contraption around his waist when he wasn't playing in order to ease the pain. He's double-doubled in two of his last three games and left early with a cut above his eye on Saturday. He's banged up, but playing well when the minutes are there.

             Randle is alternating big games with duds right now and the Lakers were getting blown out in this one. Luke Walton rolled mostly with his bench brigade in the second half and this was a disappointing night for Randle, given that both Brandon Ingram and Lonzo Ball were out with injuries. Randle had 23 points and 15 boards in his previous game and will look to get back on track against the Thunder on Wednesday night.

            Nikola Mirotic scored 18 points with five rebounds, one assist, one block and three triples in 24 minutes against the Heat on Monday.
        
        
             In case you missed it, Mirotic officially became eligible to be traded on Monday and he's already been linked to the Blazers, Jazz and Pistons. ""Hopefully, they're going to keep me a few more games at least,"" Mirotic said. ""Especially that Golden State game, I want to play. It's going to be a fun game. Let's go day by day, that's the only thing I can do."" It certainly sounds like he's expecting to be traded, but he should still have some nice value if he ends up on one of those three teams mentioned. Bobby Portis' stash appeal is also growing in deeper leagues.

            Pau Gasol revealed after Monday's game that he's been dealing with a right (shooting) hand injury.
        
        
             ""I can't really bend it much,"" Gasol said. ""It's been building up. I jammed it and it's been a little swollen. I decided to play [Monday]."" It sounds like Gasol's ability to play will be dependent on pain tolerance, but knowing the Spurs, he could certainly hit the sidelines on Wednesday in Brooklyn. If he does need to miss time, Davis Bertans and Joffrey Lauvergne would likely pick up most of his minutes. Stay tuned.

             He's showing little to no rust right now, but the Bulls are going to continue to build him up slowly. He finished 7-of-12 from the field and 2-of-3 from the line with five rebounds, five assists, two steals and two triples, posting a 31.1 usage rate in his first two games -- that would easily be a career-high, but it's obviously a small sample size. He has to be owned in all formats and his value will trend up as his restrictions are reduced.

             Zeller's playing time was a bit limited, but he was able to go for three rebounds on 2-of-4 shooting and help out with a 3-pointer. His return sent Quincy Acy back to the bench, although the latter was more effective even as a reserve. The team has a logjam of centers, as Acy, Zeller, Jarrett Allen and Jahlil Okafor are all fighting for minutes, so it isn't an ideal situation for fantasy owners at the moment.

             The Heat want to wait and see how he feels tomorrow morning before going through with the MRI, but the fact that they're even waiting to make that decision is a very positive sign. While he grabbed at his knee after the injury, after being examined in the locker room they determined he's dealing with a sprained left ankle, so it seems like he's avoided a serious injury. For now, we'll consider him questionable for Wednesday's game against the Bucks.

             This was his fifth game of the season with five or more triples and eighth of his career. Holiday will lose a few minutes with Zach LaVine back (especially once his restrictions are lifted), but he's played 40, 45, 32 and 35 minutes in his last four outings. He hit 8-of-15 shots with four rebounds, two assists, one steal and one block and fantasy owners can continue to deploy him until further notice.

             There weren't many Nets feeling good about themselves in this MLK Day loss against the crosstown rivals, but LeVert certainly wasn't hanging his head. He went 8-of-20 from the floor, including 3-of-5 from behind the arc, and he chipped in with seven rebounds, an assist and a steal. LeVert is one of a handful of younger Nets who should be leaned upon heavily down the stretch in the team's second half, so his fantasy value will remain constant.

             The double-digit scoring performance was actually Acy's first of January, as he was averaging just 5.5 points per game in his previous seven outings in the month. he can be a cheap source of rebounds for fantasy owners in deeper leagues, and he has three blocked shots over his past two outings. However, he is also fighting for crumbs with Jarrett Allen and Jahlil Okafor, so not much to see here.

            Spencer Dinwiddie finished Monday's game against the Knicks with just eight points on 2-of-14 shooting.
        
        
             Dinwiddie has been a rising start in fantasy this season, but this was certainly a clunker. He was 0-of-4 from behind the 3-point line, but at least able to salvage the fantasy line somewhat with his five assists and four rebounds while going 4-of-4 from the free-throw line. This comes on the heels of an ugly 2-of-10 shooting night last time out in Washington. It won't get much easier with the defensive-minded Spurs on the horizon Wednesday night, but don't panic. Dinwiddie's overall body of fantasy work has been stellar and he'll snap out of it.

             The loss snapped a seven-game losing streak for Miami, but Dragic was terrific, notching nine assists and five rebounds before fouling out in 38 minutes. Tyler Johnson suffered an ankle injury and will undergo some tests on Tuesday, so Dragic may see an increased workload going forward. He's scored 20 or more points in four straight and will look to make it five on Wednesday vs. the Bucks.

            Kawhi Leonard said the reason he didn't play on Monday was due to the Spurs' ""return from injury management"" program, and not due to a flare-up with the quad issue.
        
        
             The Spurs have been extremely cautious with Leonard this season, not allowing him to play unless he's had two full days off in between games, and that's apparently the reason why he sat out Monday's game (he logged 28 minutes on Saturday). Hopefully, this means we can expect to see him back on the court on Wednesday in Brooklyn, and owners can expect to get another update by Wednesday morning's shootaround at the latest.

             Carroll was 6-of-13 from the field, including 2-of-5 from behind the 3-point line, and the 'Junkyard Dog' posted career highs with free-throws made (eight) and attempts (nine). Carroll is averaging 16.0 points, 7.3 rebounds, 3.0 assists and 2.3 steals per game over his past three outings. He remains a solid source of cheap boards, steals and triples for most fantasy owners.

             He hit 9-of-16 shots and both of his free throws. Olynyk was coming off a quiet three-game stretch with 7.3 points and 5.0 rebounds in 22.3 minutes, but he played down the stretch over Hassan Whiteside because the Heat needed his offense. He's now come off the bench in favor of James Johnson in two straight games, and while tonight's line was awesome, he'll be inconsistent with the Heat using the hot-hand approach for their frontcourt.

             Kanter was nailed to the bench with Kyle O'Quinn showing a hot hand off as a reserve, while Willy Hernangomez was also sharp in his meager time on the court. He was able to start, but O'Quinn's shooting and the solid play of Michael Beasley kept Kanter nailed to the bench. It's maddening to fantasy owners, but a solution could be coming soon. Teams have inquired about the availability of the team's centers, as the team has a logjam at the position, so Kanter could see a bump in value, or potentially a new uniform, soon.

             Ntilikina was 3-of-6 from the field, including 2-of-3 from behind the arc, while going a perfect 2-of-2 from the free-throw line. He also chipped in seven rebounds, two blocked shots and a steal. It was his first-career double-double, and he was just three boards short of a triple-double. The performance was nice, and he has upside for help in the steals department, but he remains a stash option at this point.

             Johnson was grabbing at his knee after the hard fall on Monday and needed to be carted off the court, but the Heat are simply calling this an ankle sprain, and we should get official confirmation on that diagnosis once the MRI results are made public. Miami plays in Milwaukee on Wednesday, and for now, we'll be considering Johnson doubtful for that one. If he's out, Wayne Ellington could move into the starting group with Goran Dragic and Josh Richardson logging heavy minutes. Stay tuned.

             O'Quinn was a perfect 4-of-4 from the field, as he had the hot hand to eat into the minutes of Enes Kanter. In fact, O'Quinn and Willy Hernangomez were a perfect 5-of-5 from the floor, keeping Kanter nailed to the bench for a good chunk of the game. Both centers have drawn trade inquires recently, and they certainly improved their stock with solid showings. New York has a logjam at the position, so someone might be on their way out of town soon. A new situation might mean new fantasy appeal, so we'll watch this situation closely.

             He sunk a couple clutch free throws late that kept the Hawks in control of a close game and played very well against his former team. Miles Plumless started but failed to score in 17 minutes, so it might be time for Dedmon to move back into the starting unit. Either way, Dedmon is averaging 10.7 points, 9.3 rebounds and 0.7 blocks over his last three games, making him a low-end center option even if coming off the bench.

He also turned it over just three times while contributing a solid plus-12 rating. Beasley bounced back rather nicely after a scoreless effort against New Orleans in just nine minutes Sunday. His fantasy arrow has been point down lately with some erratic performances in the end of December, but this game marked his fourth time hitting 20 or more points in the past six outings and he remains a useful fantasy asset in most formats for his scoring. He was seeing more run with Tim Hardaway Jr. resting, so if you dropped Beasley, don't feel bad. Hardaway Jr. is expected to return Wednesday, limiting Beasley's minutes.

            Hassan Whiteside played just 20 minutes on Monday vs. the Bulls and was benched for the entire fourth quarter, finishing with nine points, eight rebounds, one assist and two blocks.
        
        
             Whiteside has now played in just three out of Miami's last six fourth quarters. He was a -20 tonight and didn't have it going, and the Heat needed Kelly Olynyk's offense down the stretch as they were in comeback mode. Whiteside was coming off four straight double-doubles, but his minutes have been hanging around the mid-20s lately and that may not change with the Heat trying to find action for Olynyk, James Johnson, Bam Adebayo and now Justise Winslow.

             Hawks fans would prefer them to stop winning games, but this was just their 12th victory of the season for the home crowd on MLK Day. They were 2-20 vs. the Spurs since 2006 coming in, so it was probably good for the confidence of the entire organization. Schroder took over the game in the fourth quarter, scoring at will, hitting a couple intense, driving layups in traffic and sealing the win with free throws. He's returning sixth-round fantasy value this season in nine-cat leagues.

             He's been out for a month, so if he is able to get out there tonight, he'll likely be dealing with a minutes limit. Mbah a Moute isn't worth owning in most leagues, but he could take away some minutes from P.J. Tucker once he's fully up to speed.

             Oh boy. Prince had just one point in his previous game on Friday, but played really well with big numbers in his two games prior to that. He's in a bad funk right now, but has two more games to get it turned around this week. The Hawks are (sort of) tanking and should play Prince as many minutes as he can handle going forward, allowing him to play his way out of this two-game disaster. If he's dropped in your league, we still think he's going to have a nice second half of the season, even though it's tough to envision right now.

             Burke received a nice ovation from the Knicks crowd that made its way to the Barclays Center, acknowledging him for his first time in orange and blue. He'll be operating as the third-string point guard behind Jarrett Jack and Frank Ntilikina, so he should remain on the waiver wire in all but the very deepest of fantasy leagues.

             He'd been kind of quiet since a double-double a week ago, but he got hot against the Spurs. Ilyasova's having a nice season for the Hawks and is worth owning in all formats, but that would likely change if he's traded out of Atlanta before the trade deadline.

             Lee finished with 10 points on 4-of-11 shooting, including 1-of-2 from behind the arc, while chipping in with two assists, a rebound and a blocked shot. He is also working on a 14-game streak with at least one 3-pointer dating back to Dec. 18. Lee continues to be a decent fantasy asset in 9-cat leagues, particularly when Tim Hardaway Jr. is not on the court.

             Bertans has had some big games lately and probably would have had another one today, had his shot been falling. He's averaging 13.2 points and 3.2 3-pointers over his last five games, but he won't help in any other areas. But as long as Kawhi Leonard (shoulder) and Rudy Gay (heel) are hurting, Bertans is going to play. And it doesn't hurt that Manu Ginobili also went down today with a thigh injury.

His minutes were somewhat limited dude to four personal fouls, but he obviously still had a very nice line. He had a much better time than his last outing aginst the Nets Dec. 14, when he left in the first half with a sore knee. In his previous two full games against Brooklyn he is averaging 28.0 points and 9.0 rebounds per outing. He'll get another crack at them at MSG on Jan. 30.

             Green has played in back-to-back games and played 10 more minutes tonight than he did on Saturday. Manu Ginobili went down (again) with a thigh injury today so Green could see a slightly bigger role going forward, assuming that he can stay healthy. He has been a bit of a nightmare to own, but he also has hit three 3-pointers in each of his last two games, and had at least a steal and block in each of them, which is why people still deal with him in fantasyland.

             Leonard said he was simply held out for maintenance today, and not his new shoulder injury, so he should be back for the next one. But we're not sure how often he'll play, and this is starting to look like a lost season since he's only appeared in eight games thus far. And while Anderson hasn't exactly been a Kawhi clone in his absence, he's worth a look in deeper leagues. He's averaging 7.6 points, 6.4 rebounds, 3.0 assists and 2.2 steals over his last five games.

             Johnson won't return to Monday's game but this is very encouraging considering how bad it looked initially -- he was in agony after an awkward landing and needed to be wheeled off the court. He immediately grabbed his knee after the injury and could get an MRI in the coming days, so we're not ready to say he's out of the woods quite yet. If he misses time, Goran Dragic and Josh Richardson will be leaned on very heavily, and Wayne Ellington could get more minutes. Stay tuned.

            Kelly Oubre had an efficient outing on Monday, going 5-of-9 from the field and 6-of-7 from the stripe on his way to 19 points in 35 minutes off the bench.
        
        
             Oubre added three 3-pointers, five rebounds, one block and two turnovers to his stat line, and he severely outplayed Markieff Morris in this one. He's been trending up over the past week with averages of 14.5 points, 5.3 boards, 2.5 treys and 1.8 turnovers per game on 56.3% shooting, so give him a look if those numbers are appealing.

            Markieff Morris was held to just six points on 3-of-6 shooting Monday, to go with six rebounds, four assists, one steal, one block and three turnovers in 24 minutes.
        
        
             Morris had a couple nice games to bring in the New Year, but he's gone back to garbage-mode over the past four with meager averages of 8.3 points, 4.8 boards, 2.0 assists, 1.3 triples and 1.8 turnovers per game on 54.2% shooting in 28.1 minutes a night. Basically, when Kelly Oubre is playing well, Morris' minutes suffer, and that's likely to remain a trend for the rest of the season.

            Otto Porter's shooting woes continued on Monday, as he went just 3-of-8 from the field on his way to eight points, six boards, two assists, three steals and two turnovers in 31 minutes.
        
        
             Porter's jumper has been off in January, as he's been connecting on just 37.9 percent of his field goal attempts, and this was his third game in a row without a single 3-pointer. He's also seen his usage rate dip to just 14.5 over the past seven games, so there's no denying that he's in a dreadful cold streak, but at least he's been coming through with the defensive stats to keep his value afloat. Porter should be able to right the ship soon, so now looks like a good buy-low opportunity.

            Bradley Beal netted 19 points on 8-of-17 shooting Monday to go with one 3-pointer, three rebounds, three assists, one block and an unfortunate seven turnovers in 41 minutes.
        
        
             Turnovers typically aren't an issue for Beal, so we'll chalk that up to some pesky defense from Milwaukee. On the whole, Beal is hitting career-highs in points (23.8), boards (4.4), dimes (3.8) and steals (1.2) this season, which translates to top-40 value in 9-cat leagues. He’s easily been Washington’s best player this year, and he has a good shot of making his first All-Star team this season if he can manage to stay healthy.

Corey Brewer should also step up in the rotation, and the Lakers will need a team-wide effort with Lonzo Ball (knee) also unavailable tonight.

             Wall has finally been trending in a positive direction over the past few weeks, posting averages of 25.9 points, 11.3 assists, 2.1 steals, 1.3 blocks, 1.4 triples and 5.3 turnovers per contest on 44.2% shooting from the field and 70.7% from the stripe, which has been good enough for top-15 value when punting turnovers. Wall hasn’t been great from the charity stripe this season, but as a career 78.5% shooting from the line, it should only be a matter of time until he’s draining those.

We're hoping it wasn't as bad as it looked, but Johnson could be looking at extended absence -- it shouldn't take long before Miami runs tests. With Dion Waiters (ankle) out of the picture, Miami can ill-afford to lose Johnson -- if he misses time, Goran Dragic and Josh Richardson will be leaned on very heavily, and Wayne Ellington could get more minutes. Stay tuned.

He’s been a steady top-40 play this season, hitting career-highs across the board, and if he could get his steals numbers (1.2) closer to his average from his 2015-16 campaign (1.7), he could easily work his way into a top-30 evaluation.

             This was a nice bounce-back performance from Bledsoe following Sunday’s 4-of-16 shooting performance, and it was particularly impressive given that he did it against the No. 9 ranked defense against point guards. Bledsoe has been a top-30 producer since landing in Milwaukee, and as long as he can stay healthy, he should be able to sustain his early-round evaluation.

            T.J. McConnell scored 18 points on 8-of-13 shooting Monday to go with six boards, eight assists, one 3-pointer, three steals, one block and two turnovers in 32 minutes off the bench.
        
        
             McConnell provided a nice spark off the bench in this chippy game, and with J.J. Redick going down with a left leg contusion, he could be looking at extended minutes on Thursday in Boston if Redick is forced to the sidelines. The scoring comes and goes with McConnell, but he's been flirting with mid-round value since Christmas due to his 5.0 dimes and 2.1 steals per contest, so he's someone to consider swooping up in deep leagues.

             Napier left during the second quarter of Sunday's game and this is an unfortunate break, as he'd been playing very well the past few weeks. Hopefully we'll get some good news after Portland's shootaround, but if he can't suit up Pat Connaughton should get extra run with the second unit.

             Embiid didn’t play very well in his previous meeting against the Raptors, but he got going early in this one, scoring 12 of Philly’s first 18 points and he never really took his foot off the gas pedal with his gaudy 40.2 usage rate. He did appear to tweak his right hand during the third quarter, which is the same hand that has been giving him issues over the past few weeks, but he did play through it and with the 76ers off until Thursday it would be surprising to see him forced to the sidelines.

             While Saric struggled with his shot for much of the game, he hit some big shots in the clutch to keep Philly on top in Monday's tightly contested matchup, and he rounded out his stat line with one 3-pointer, seven rebounds, one assist, one steal, one block and two turnovers. He's been playing some phenomenal basketball over the past month, so it would be surprising to see him lose his spot in the starting five if and when Markelle Fultz (shoulder) is able to return to the court.

             Covington has been struggling through the month of January, connecting on just 35.5% of his attempts over the past four games to go with measly averages of 8.5 points, 5.8 boards, 1.5 triples, 1.5 assists, 0.8 steals and 2.0 turnovers per contest. He's prone to the occasional cold streak, but it should only be a matter of time until he's churning out elite value again, particularly in the steals department.

             L.A. is erring on the side of caution, predictably, but it doesn't sound serious and an MRI has already ruled out structural damage. His absence opens up the backcourt for Tyler Ennis, Josh Hart and Jordan Clarkson, and maybe we'll even see Gary Payton II in the rotation tonight. Owners should consider Ball questionable for Wednesday's game in OKC.

Josh Hart is probably the best bet for success in Ball's absence, while it should also help Jordan Clarkson and make Tyler Ennis relevant today.

             Wright has actually been better with the second unit this season, so Kyle Lowry’s return isn’t necessarily a bad thing for his outlook. Fred VanVleet exited the game with a knee contusion, and if he can't play on Wednesday against the Pistons, Wright should be able to earn minutes in the mid-20s. He's played well enough this season to warrant ownership in most leagues.

             The minutes were a season-low for Ibaka, and this is just another example of Dwane Casey not being afraid to mess with his frontcourt rotations when the starting bigs aren't giving him the energy he'd like. That said, Ibaka's playing time was trending towards the 30s through the month of January, so hopefully, Serge's minutes will be back in that range on Wednesday against Detroit. Jonas Valanciunas finished with eight points, five boards, one assist and two turnovers in 14 minutes.

            Kyle Lowry (back) struggled with his shot on Monday, scoring 13 points on 3-of-16 shooting to go with one triple, seven boards, four assists, three steals and four turnovers in 37 minutes.
        
        
             While Lowry couldn’t get his shot to drop, he was out there for quality minutes and fell fairly hard on his tailbone a few times without needing to take any plays off, so hopefully, the bruised tailbone will be a non-issue moving forward. He did get ejected from the game with six seconds left after exchanging some choice words with Ben Simmons, and reportedly got into it with Simmons in the hallway after the game, so he could be looking at a suspension here.

            Nicolas Batum hit just 4-of-13 shots, but also had a 3-pointer, 14 points, eight rebounds, five assists and two steals in Monday's win over the Pistons.
        
        
             The shooting was bad, but it was nice to see Batum do some other things, as well. He's had a rough season and his gimpy elbow has slowed him down, but there's still a decent chance Batum has a nice second half. Turnovers have been an issue for him and he had four more today, but he's scored in double figures in three straight and has at least a steal and a 3-pointer in each of those.

             Dwight destroyed Drummond today, holding him to just three points, and posted his sixth game of the season with at least 20 points and 15 rebounds. Only DeMarcus Cousins and Anthony Davis have more of those than Howard, and if you discount free throw percentage, he's been worth a fifth-round pick this season.

             The fact 21 points is a season high for Marvin tells you how his season is going, but he has played well recently, scoring at least 15 points in four of his last five games, while grabbing some rebounds and knocking down some 3-pointers. He's probably going to be busy for a few more games as Frank Kaminsky left Monday's game late with a right ankle injury that could keep him out for a few games. Williams looks like a solid add if he's available in your league right now.

He'll end his evening with eight points, two rebounds and one turnover in 16 minutes, and for now, we'll consider him questionable for Wednesday's game against the Pistons.

             This was his best game in recent memory and he clearly had some luck working with his shot today. Tolliver would be worth a look if he was starting for the Pistons, but Stan Van Gundy has decided to roll with Reggie Bullock instead. Tolliver's currently not worth owning in most fantasy leagues, despite the nearly perfect shooting day.

             This might have been Smith's best game of the season and if it wasn't, it was his first double-double. Smith was projected to play very well in the absence of Reggie Jackson, but he's been a little bit disappointing.

             The scoring was a disaster, but he helped make up for it with the assists and steals. He was in some foul trouble and just didn't have it today, which was surprising considering he'd been playing well and had 21 points, 15 boards and three blocks on Saturday. It speaks to what kind of season Dwight Howard is having for the Hornets, as he simply dominated Drummond in this one.

             Bullock usually scores and hits some 3-pointers, but the steals were a new wrinkle to his game today. Bullock was fading hard, scoring 10 or fewer points in three straight games, but looked fantastic today. He's mostly a one-trick pony that can score and hit some 3-pointers, so keep that in mind if you make a move on him.

             Turner has been diagnosed with a ligament sprain and muscle strain in his right (shooting) elbow, and while the injury will not require surgery, he'll be fitted with a brace and be listed as week-to-week. Unfortunately, it sounds like this could be a long-term absence, but Turner offers way too much upside to outright cut in most scenarios. Domantas Sabonis will be the starter moving forward, and he needs to be owned in all leagues with no clear return date in sight for Turner.

             He was defending a driving Tobias Harris and rolled it pretty badly on the play. He was down for several moments and in obvious pain, and couldn't stand up the first time he tried. He limped to the bench, and then locker room, and given the amount of pain he was in, it would not be surprising to see him miss at least a game or two due to the injury. Marvin Williams and Johnny O'Bryant would get some extra work if he's out.

            Kawhi Leonard (quad) will not play Monday vs. the Hawks.
        
        
             This is the same quad issue that delayed Leonard's start to the season, and it's extremely concerning that it's become an issue again with how careful the Spurs have been with him (he's played in just nine games this season). The Spurs take on the Nets in Brooklyn on Wednesday, and for now, we'll be considering Leonard questionable for that one. With him unavailable tonight, Kyle Anderson will draw the start with LaMarcus Aldridge doing the heavy lifting on offense.

             In case you missed it, THJ will be unavailable for the Knicks' MLK Day game against Memphis with it being the second game of a back-to-back set, but it sounds like there's a good chance he'll replace Lance Thomas in the starting five on Wednesday. With Hardaway Jr. on the sidelines on Monday, there will be more minutes available for Michael Beasley and Courtney Lee will see a slight uptick in usage.

             He just can't catch a break and neither can his fantasy owners. His shoulder seemed fine in Saturday's game, but this quad injury has been an issue since the offseason. Don't be surprised if the Spurs hold him out in what should be an easy win. If he sits, Kyle Anderson and Davis Bertans will step up with LaMarcus Aldridge carrying the offense.

            The Nets will sign forward James Webb III to a two-way contract.
        
        
             In 21 G-League games, Webb posted averages of 11.6 points, 6.7 rebounds, 1.4 assists, 1.3 steals and 2.0 steals. The Nets have five centers, but don't have great depth at forward behind Rondae Hollis-Jefferson and DeMarre Carroll. For now, Webb is safe to ignore in fantasy leagues.

             Kyle Lowry (back) is back in the lineup a little sooner than expected, but Wright should still have some value in a four-game week. He was playing really well before Lowry's injury, so his owners might want to see if he can get it going again.

Delon Wright will head back to the bench, but he was playing really well as a reserve before Lowry's injury. Fred VanVleet is likely the biggest loser in terms of fantasy value.

""And he’s going to have more of a featured role in that group as well."" Zach LaVine is going to be limited for quite some time, so Valentine could still see a decent amount of minutes.  However, he had just two points on 1-of-3 shooting, five rebounds and three assists in 21 minutes on Saturday, so his fantasy arrow is pointing down at the moment.

Coach Luke Walton said Zubac entered the summer as the starting center, but the acquisition of Brook Lopez changed things and the Lakers have been using Julius Randle, Larry Nance and Kyle Kuzma at the five this season. The Lakers are expected to be sellers at the deadline, so maybe a trade opens things up.

            Kyle Lowry (tailbone) said he's planning to play on Monday vs. the 76ers.
        
        
             Barring a setback in warmups, Lowry will be back in the starting lineup after a three-game absence. Delon Wright would return to the bench if Lowry plays, but he'll still have some value as a combo guard off the bench with Toronto playing four times this week. Fred VanVleet has been on fire lately, but he loses most of his streaming appeal with Lowry back.

            Heat coach Erik Spoelstra had nothing but good things to say about Hassan Whiteside's performance on Sunday.
        
        
             ""He was also protecting the paint for us as well,"" Spoelstra said. ""This is a dynamic attacking team. When he’s locked in, he can be elite at what he does. We just have to build on that. The next challenge is to be consistent. I love what he did in the third quarter."" The Heat went away from him in the fourth quarter because Spoelstra said the current group was rolling, but this has been a trend lately -- he's only played in three out of five fourth quarters in his last five outings and has played about 15 minutes total in that span.

             ""I know this: There are not coaches on this staff that don’t believe in the kid,"" Clifford said. ""I think he’s done fine. But he’s playing behind some kids who are playing [better]: Jeremy Lamb’s summer changed things for Malik Monk. You can’t not play Jeremy; you can argue he’s been our third-best offensive player."" Monk's biggest strength is supposed to be his shooting, but he's not hitting his shots and is also a liability on defense. The Hornets will eventually give him a look if they decide that a playoff run is out of the question, but he's off the radar in re-draft formats.

             Len hit 6-of-7 field goals but he was 0-of-2 at the line, and his extreme efficiency masks the fact that he played fewer than 20 minutes for the fifth consecutive game. The potential is obvious, but Len is impossible to trust while Tyson Chandler is active and the frontcourt rotation includes Marquese Chriss, Dragan Bender and (occasionally) Greg Monroe.

             Teague just missed his season-high of 23 points, which he set back on Oct. 30. The Wolves are now 4-0 when he scores at least 20 points, but the fact that it's only happened four times is indicative of his supporting role most nights. The best news for fantasy owners is that his knee injury hasn't limited him, and he's again producing mid-round value on a nightly basis.

""When [Bjelica] plays the small forward position, it makes us real long,"" he said. ""The 3-point shooting is obviously something we need and it opens up the floor. He complements all of our players well, the starters and the bench guys."" Thibs' high praise aside, Bjelica isn't a standard-league asset while the Wolves' frontcourt is healthy.

He'll only be worth DFS consideration if Napier misses more games, which is far from certain.

             Aminu came in averaging 33.0 minutes per game but was the victim of a slow start for Portland -- trailing by 14 points at halftime, coach Terry Stotts wasn't shy about mixing up his rotations in the second half. His shot still isn't falling (42.1 percent in January) but Aminu chips in enough elsewhere to be worth holding in most formats.

             Napier was efficient with 3-of-5 FGs and 2-of-2 FTs, but his back ""tightened up"" during the game, according to coach Terry Stotts. His recent play has ensured him a solid spot in the rotation, but owners will need to check for updates on Monday before relying on him in weekly lineups. If he does miss time, expect Pat Connaughton to pick up most of the slack.

Turner's starting gig has given him borderline value in roto leagues over the past month, in 28.4 minutes per game, but he's limited by a low usage rate (15.0%) and perpetual lack of supporting stats.

             Monroe hadn't played since Jan. 3, a stretch of three consecutive DNP-CDs, and he was barely a blip tonight -- he gave up a pair of baskets to Al Jefferson and was immediately yanked by coach Jay Triano.

             Jackson went from being questionable due to hip and groin injuries, to starting for the 15th time in his NBA career. He had a few sloppy turnovers but was otherwise a bright spot for Phoenix in this blowout home loss. Warren should be day-to-day, so this doesn't do much for Jackson's immediate value heading into a two-game week, but it's a nice reminder of his long-term upside.

             Canaan missed three games with the injury and his return predictably cut into the workload of starting PG Tyler Ulis (24 minutes). If you're looking for a Suns PG to own, Canaan is the better option with top-100 value over the past month.

             Bender also committed three turnovers in 30 minutes, so there was nothing to salvage the line for fantasy owners. In the previous two games without Marquese Chriss (hip), Bender was averaging 17.0 points, 4.5 triples, 7.0 rebounds, 3.0 assists and 2.5 blocks. Owners should hold tight until we've seen Chriss take the court, although it doesn't help that Phoenix plays just twice again this week.

             Booker was in foul trouble tonight but that wasn't a real issue, especially since Phoenix let him play down the stretch of a blowout 120-97 defeat. He continues to run the offense more often and the Suns coaching staff is pleased with his playmaking. ""Just as a point guard, he’s setting us up, he’s getting us into our offense,"" coach Jay Triano said before the game. ""We’re asking him to be a big scorer, to set everyone up ... It’s a little bit of a new role for him."" Booker is poised for a big finish in 2018.

Cousins is averaging career-highs in assists (5.1) and 3-pointers (2.3) this season, and he's yet to miss a game.

            Anthony Davis powered the Pelicans to a 123-118 overtime win over the Knicks on Sunday, erupting for 48 points, 17 boards, two triples, four steals, three blocks and four turnovers in 50 minutes.
        
        
             Davis helped the Pelicans overcome a 19-point halftime deficit, hitting numerous circus shots (an example of one in the video below) while rocking a ridiculous 40.9 usage rate through the second half of action. He's now scored at least 40 points in his previous two outings at Madison Square Garden, and this was also the first time we've seen a player go off for 48 points, 17 rebounds and four steals since Michael Jordan did it back in 1990. That's some elite company.

             Holiday also went 4-of-5 from the stripe to give him a 73.1 true shooting percentage, and he was particularly impressive during the overtime period with his 47.5 usage rate. He’s hitting career-highs in points (18.1), boards (4.4), triples (1.6) and field goal percentage (48.9) this season, which has him flirting with top-35 value on the year, and there's no reason to expect a sudden drop off in production.

             Rondo struggled with his shot, was sloppy with the rock and played some very subpar defense against Jarrett Jack, which resulted in him getting benched down the stretch in favor of Ian Clark. We'd expect a bounce-back performance on Tuesday with a potential revenge game against the Celtics in Boston.

             Porzingis had a hot start to the game, but he cooled off after halftime, going 4-of-11 from the field through the second half of action and his usage rate also dipped to 24.5. The Knicks blew a 19-point lead, which was partly due to some miraculous play from Anthony Davis, but they also played fairly horribly as a team on the defensive end. Speaking of terrible defense, Enes Kanter finished with 18 points, 10 rebounds, one assist, two blocks and one turnover in 36 minutes.

             Lee suffered from some suffocating defense from Jrue Holiday, but he’s also just been less involved in the offense since Tim Hardaway Jr. returned to the court. In the two games since THJ has gotten back out there, Lee’s usage has dipped to 15.0, so it looks like his value will take a bit of a hit once Hardaway Jr. is fully up to speed.

             He did add two triples, five boards, three dimes, three steals and three turnovers while he was out there, but the main takeaway is the leg injury. The injury occurred on a non-contact play on New York's final possession, and while he was able to walk off the court under his own power, he was sporting an obvious limp. The Knicks play again on Monday in Brooklyn, so it wouldn't be surprising to see THJ hit the sidelines for the second leg of this back-to-back.

             We should get another update following Monday morning's shootaround, but Jordan is likely headed for a game-time decision. If he's out, Willie Reed would be in line for another start, and he'd be someone to think about as a streamer after posting a 14-point, 13-board double-double as a starter on Saturday. Montrezl Harrell would also have the opportunity for extended minutes. Stay tuned.

             Chriss was unable to practice on Saturday, so there wasn't really ever a chance of him suiting up for Sunday's game. Dragan Bender has been fantastic in his absence with averages of 17.0 points, 7.0 boards, 4.5 triples, 3.0 assists, 2.5 blocks and just 1.0 turnover per game over the past two, so he'll be a popular DFS play tonight. The Suns play again on Tuesday in Portland, and for now, we'll be considering Chriss questionable for that one.

             Jackson was a full participant in Saturday's practice and considering he only missed one game, he shouldn't be dealing with any sort of minutes limit tonight. He could be looking at playing time in the mid-20s with Marquese Chriss (hip) unavailable, and it'll be interesting to see if he affects Dragan Bender's minutes. Jackson has been up-and-down this season, so he's not the best fantasy target with a tough matchup against Indiana.

             Canaan will be returning from a three-game absence, and he should slot back into his 20-minute bench role, which will result in fewer minutes for Tyler Ulis. Jackson's return to action could push Danuel House out of the rotation entirely. Canaan was playing pretty well prior to going down, so he could be someone to consider grabbing in deep leagues.

            Khris Middleton had another rough shooting performance on Sunday, going 3-of-16 from the field on his way to 16 points, six boards, one 3-pointer, two assists, two steals and three turnovers.
        
        
             Middleton simply couldn’t find his shot in this one, and while Miami did play some nice defense against him, he also missed some wide-open looks. He’s been struggling mightily over the past two, connecting on just 17.9% of his shot attempts, but he should be able to turn things around sooner rather than later.

             Brogdon was excellent on both ends of the floor, picking his spots and getting some easy buckets under the basket while playing some tough defense against Goran Dragic. He’s been thriving since re-entering the starting five with averages of 13.6 points, 6.0 boards, 3.2 dimes, 0.8 steals and 0.8 turnovers per game on 50.8% shooting. We wouldn't expect Tony Snell to replace him in the starting group anytime soon.

             Bledsoe couldn’t buy a bucket in this one, missing all six of his 3-point attempts and finishing just 4-of-16 from the field and 2-of-3 from the charity stripe. Milwaukee's inability to connect from long-range (4-of-28 from distance) in this one made it easy for the Heat to clog up the paint, which made it tough for Bledsoe to get to the basket. That said, we'd expect a bit of a bounce-back performance from Bledsoe on Monday in Washington.

            Hassan Whiteside posted a 15-point, 10-board double-double during Sunday's easy win over Milwaukee, adding two steals, four blocks and four turnovers in 25 minutes.
        
        
             Whiteside racked up all four of his swats during the first quarter, and he also got his points efficiently, going 5-of-6 from the field and 5-of-7 from the charity stripe for an 82.6 true shooting percentage. He was a beast on the glass with his 30.0 defensive rebounding rate, and he likely would have earned some more minutes if the game weren't a blowout. That said, as long as he's earning at least 25 minutes a night, he's capable of producing elite value in fantasy hoops.

             Richardson also hit both of his free throws to give him an elite 81.0 true shooting percentage on the evening, and he's been absolutely crushing it over the past month with averages of 17.8 points, 3.7 assists, 1.8 triples, 1.4 steals, 1.1 blocks and 1.9 turnovers per contest on 51.9% shooting, which has been good enough for top-20 value. He's hitting career-highs in every relevant category this season, and there's no reason to expect him to suddenly slow down.

            Goran Dragic kept his hot streak alive on Sunday, scoring 25 points on 9-of-17 shooting to go with three rebounds, four 3-pointers, two assists, one steal and two turnovers in 33 minutes.
        
        
             The Dragon has really picked up his play over the past seven games with averages of 21.9 points, 2.1 triples, 6.9 dimes, 5.1 boards, 0.9 steals and 2.9 turnovers per contest on 45.6% shooting, which has been good enough for top-60 value in 9-cat leagues. He’s seen his usage rate spike to 28.8 and his assist percentage has jumped to 31.0 over that seven-game span, which has unsurprisingly coincided with a seven-game win-streak for Miami. He had a sluggish start to the season, but he looks primed for a strong second half, particularly with Dion Waiters done for the year.

             He’s been a mid-round guy ever since Dion Waiters (ankle) hit the sidelines, pumping out averages of 16.0 points, 2.3 assists, 1.8 triples, 1.1 steals and just 0.8 turnovers per contest on 45.4% shooting from the field and 88.9% from the stripe. There really isn’t anyone on the roster to challenge him for minutes with Waiters done for the year, so he should be able to sustain his mid-round evaluation.

             The shooting wasn’t pretty as Johnson went just 2-of-8 from the field, but he did do a fantastic job defensively against Giannis Antetokounmpo and had a nice two-man game going with Tyler Johnson. JJ has been better as a starter this season, but Erik Spoelstra will likely continue to alternate the starting four-spot based on the matchup. Kelly Olynyk finished with seven points, seven boards, one steal and one turnover in 18 minutes off the bench.

             Russell still hasn't been able to go through any 5-on-5 work, although he did recently go through some 3-on-3 drills and looked good according to head coach Kenny Atkinson. The Nets will practice again on Tuesday, and if Russell is able to go through 5-on-5, full-contact work, there's a chance he could make it back out there for Wednesday's game against the Spurs. He's close enough that he needs to be stashed in all leagues.

There's a video making the rounds on Twitter of Fultz getting some shots up at practice, and his jumper certainly looks awkward to say the least. There's a decent chance Fultz won't be taking the court this season, so he's not a great stash in most 12-team leagues.

            Andre Roberson (knee) was a full participant in Sunday's light practice, but he will not play Monday vs. the Kings.
        
        
             ""We didn’t have a lot of contact in practice, but he went through the entire practice, so he’s getting better,"" Thunder coach Billy Donovan said Sunday. While Roberson is improving, Monday will mark his eighth straight game on the sidelines, which will likely result in Terrance Ferguson earning another start.

             Shams Charania of Yahoo! Sports reported on Saturday that Sefolosha is expected to undergo season-ending knee surgery, but it sounds like Sefolosha is trying to avoid going under the knife. Surgery still seems like the most likely scenario, and with just late-round value on the year, there's not much reason to hang onto Thabo.

He's a must-own fantasy asset regardless of where he begins the game.

             Johnson returned from a five-game absence back on Wednesday, but he felt tightness in his hip after just 20 minutes. He's not a big part of the rotation and wasn't able to practice on Saturday, so the Pistons may play it safe and hold him out, especially with the trade deadline coming up. Reggie Bullock should have some low-end value this week for his 3-pointers and steals.

            Jason Jones of the Sacramento Bee said the Kings ""rave"" about Harry Giles' potential.
        
        
             He had some red flags coming out of high school and college due to some knee problems, so the Kings want to make sure he ""builds up the strength"" in his legs and core. The Kings ruled him out through January before the season started, but we haven't been updated since. Jones added that ""his knees are fine"" and the Kings are not concerned, so maybe we'll finally get a look at him down the stretch.

             ""It’s got to come from us, but it’s got to come from us holding each other accountable,"" WCS said. Like, enough is enough. I think Coach is at that point where he’s not going to play you if you’re not doing the right thing, and I think that’s how it should be."" The Kings have lost four straight and seven out of their last eight, but WCS has been terrific with 15.6 points, 7.8 rebounds, 2.4 assists, 1.6 steals and 0.5 blocks over his last 10 games. We wish he blocked more shots, but he's getting the job done for fantasy owners.

             Harris and Nikola Jokic were the only two players to show up in the 112-80 blowout loss, finishing as the only double-digit point producers. He is having quite the January, averaging 21.8 points, 3.3 rebounds, 2.7 assists and 1.7 steals per game in six outings. He continues to put up top-40 fantasy value in nearly all formats, and he is showing no signs of slowing down.

             Jokic was very productive, hitting 3-of-6 from behind the arc and 4-of-4 from the free-throw line, persevering despite a blowout on the scoreboard. He was one of just two Nuggets (Gary Harris) to go for double-digit point totals and please his fantasy owners. He also chipped in with nine rebounds, seven assists and steals. Jokic and his teammates have just three games on tap in the upcoming week, but favorable home games against the defensively-challenged Mavericks and Suns highlight the slate.

He was able to extend his streak to 12 straight games with five or more rebounds. Chalk it up as just one bad outing. He has been a top-70 fantasy option over the past month. He'll remain a decent fantasy option until Paul Millsap (wrist) is healthy enough to return.

The two-point stinker snaps a career-high 10-game streak with double-digit points. He has hit just 2-of-14 (14.3 percent) from the field over the past two outings, as The Blue Arrow is in a bit of a funk. It didn't help facing a decent defensive club on their home court. He should find more room to operate on Tuesday against Dallas.

             He came in averaging 24.7 points over the past three games, with 2.7 triples, 5.7 rebounds, 2.0 assists and 0.7 steals, so owners should be willing to overlook tonight's rough shooting. Harris has only three games with more than two turnovers this season, which highlights his unique appeal in 9-cat leagues -- his 1.0 turnovers per game are third-lowest among players averaging 30+ minutes per game, trailing only Trevor Ariza and Otto Porter.

             Stanley Johnson (hip) was out tonight due to tightness in his hip, which allowed Bullock to log unfettered minutes as the starting SF.

He's been extremely efficient for the past month with 57.8% field goals and 83.3% free throws, while hitting 2.4 triples per game, so owners might as well ride the hot hand.

             Moreland had two turnovers but generally looked good, and he made some smart passes from the high post tonight. This will help him hold off Boban Marjanovic (DNP-CD) for backup-center minutes, but he's not a fantasy asset while Andre Drummond is healthy.

            Andre Drummond had another big all-around game on Saturday with 21 points (8-of-13 FGs, 5-of-6 FTs), 15 rebounds, four assists, three blocks, two steals and one turnover.
        
        
             Drummond committed just one turnover and two fouls in 34 minutes, and it's safe to conclude that his rib injury is no longer a concern. He missed one game on Jan. 6, but in the three games since he's averaging a stellar 19.7 points, 16.3 boards, 4.0 assists, 2.0 steals and 2.0 blocks. That was against a trio of vulnerable frontcourts, though, and he'll draw a tougher matchup vs. Dwight Howard on Monday. Trainers did look at Drummond's right foot in the second quarter tonight but he looked fine after halftime, so we'll leave him off the injury report.

             Parker didn't last long, but it wasn't due to any type of setback with his injury. He and the starters received plenty of rest in the second half, giving way to the reserve in a blowout victory. The Spurs are next in action on Monday afternoon in Atlanta. They have four games on tap in the upcoming week, but no back-to-back situations.

            Avery Bradley's shot finally started falling on Saturday, as he went 10-of-19 from the field for 26 points, with a 6-of-10 mark from downtown.
        
        
             Bradley added three rebounds, two steals, one assist and one block in 38 minutes vs. the Bulls tonight. Fantasy owners probably did a double-take when looking at the boxscore tonight, as this is the sixth time all season AB has made more than half of his shots. He's starting to warm up after missing a chunk of time with a groin injury, so hopefully owners' patience will continue to pay off.

             Mirotic missed one game due to illness but looked fine vs. Detroit tonight. He's eligible to be traded on Monday and teams like the Pistons and Jazz have been mentioned as possible suitors -- for now, the Bulls are reportedly holding out for a first-round draft pick. Heat coach Fred Hoiberg referred to playing Mirotic and Lauri Markkanen together as ""a fun lineup,"" so as long as he's with Chicago his role appears safe.

             Bertans was a very efficient 6-of-8 from the field, including 6-of-7 from behind the 3-point line. He and Manu Ginobili are the only Spurs to post six triples in a game this season. Bertans also accomplished the feat back on Jan. 8 against the Kings. He is having a nice January, posting 13.0 points per game while averaging 3.0 3-pointers per game. If you need triples Bertans is worth scooping up while running hot.

             Chicago opened the game 15-of-20 from the field against a listless defensive effort from Detroit, and they held on for an impressive 107-105 victory. Dunn has now recorded at least eight assists in six consecutive games, which is a career-long streak, and he's thriving as the undoubted starting PG for Chicago. Zach LaVine's return is primarily a threat to Denzel Valentine and David Nwaba, so Dunn's owners can keep him locked in active lineups going forward.

             Harris and Nikola Jokic were the only two players to show up in the 112-80 blowout loss, finishing as the only double-digit point producers. He is having quite the January, averaging 21.8 points, 3.3 rebounds, 2.7 assists and 1.7 steals per game in six outings. He continues to put up top-40 fantasy value in nearly all formats, and he is showing no signs of slowing down.

             Jokic was very productive, hitting 3-of-6 from behind the arc and 4-of-4 from the free-throw line, persevering despite a blowout on the scoreboard. He was one of just two Nuggets (Gary Harris) to go for double-digit point totals and please his fantasy owners. He also chipped in with nine rebounds, seven assists and steals. Jokic and his teammates have just three games on tap in the upcoming week, but favorable home games against the defensively-challenged Mavericks and Suns highlight the slate.

He was able to extend his streak to 12 straight games with five or more rebounds. Chalk it up as just one bad outing. He has been a top-70 fantasy option over the past month. He'll remain a decent fantasy option until Paul Millsap (wrist) is healthy enough to return.

The two-point stinker snaps a career-high 10-game streak with double-digit points. He has hit just 2-of-14 (14.3 percent) from the field over the past two outings, as The Blue Arrow is in a bit of a funk. It didn't help facing a decent defensive club on their home court.

He's been extremely efficient for the past month with 57.8% field goals and 83.3% free throws, while hitting 2.4 triples per game, so owners might as well ride the hot hand.

            Eric Moreland set a career-high with five assists on Saturday, adding three points and five rebounds in 14 minutes off the bench.
        
        
             Moreland had two turnovers but generally looked good, and he made some smart passes from the high post tonight. This will help him hold off Boban Marjanovic (DNP-CD) for backup-center minutes, but he's not a fantasy asset while Andre Drummond is healthy.

            Andre Drummond had another big all-around game on Saturday with 21 points (8-of-13 FGs, 5-of-6 FTs), 15 rebounds, four assists, three blocks, two steals and one turnover.
        
        
             Drummond committed just one turnover and two fouls in 34 minutes, and it's safe to conclude that his rib injury is no longer a concern. He missed one game on Jan. 6, but in the three games since he's averaging a stellar 19.7 points, 16.3 boards, 4.0 assists, 2.0 steals and 2.0 blocks. That was against a trio of vulnerable frontcourts, though, and he'll draw a tougher matchup vs. Dwight Howard on Monday. Trainers did look at Drummond's right foot in the second quarter tonight but he looked fine after halftime, so we'll leave him off the injury report.

             Parker didn't last long, but it wasn't due to any type of setback with his injury. He and the starters received plenty of rest in the second half, giving way to the reserve in a blowout victory. The Spurs are next in action on Monday afternoon in Atlanta. They have four games on tap in the upcoming week, but no back-to-back situations.

            Avery Bradley's shot finally started falling on Saturday, as he went 10-of-19 from the field for 26 points, with a 6-of-10 mark from downtown.
        
        
             Bradley added three rebounds, two steals, one assist and one block in 38 minutes vs. the Bulls tonight. Fantasy owners probably did a double-take when looking at the boxscore tonight, as this is the sixth time all season AB has made more than half of his shots. He's starting to warm up after missing a chunk of time with a groin injury, so hopefully owners' patience will continue to pay off.

             Mirotic missed one game due to illness but looked fine vs. Detroit tonight. He's eligible to be traded on Monday and teams like the Pistons and Jazz have been mentioned as possible suitors -- for now, the Bulls are reportedly holding out for a first-round draft pick. Heat coach Fred Hoiberg referred to playing Mirotic and Lauri Markkanen together as ""a fun lineup,"" so as long as he's with Chicago his role appears safe.

             Bertans was a very efficient 6-of-8 from the field, including 6-of-7 from behind the 3-point line. He and Manu Ginobili are the only Spurs to post six triples in a game this season. Bertans also accomplished the feat back on Jan. 8 against the Kings. He is having a nice January, posting 13.0 points per game while averaging 3.0 3-pointers per game. If you need triples Bertans is worth scooping up while running hot.

             Chicago opened the game 15-of-20 from the field against a listless defensive effort from Detroit, and they held on for an impressive 107-105 victory. Dunn has now recorded at least eight assists in six consecutive games, which is a career-long streak, and he's thriving as the undoubted starting PG for Chicago. Zach LaVine's return is primarily a threat to Denzel Valentine and David Nwaba, so Dunn's owners can keep him locked in active lineups going forward.

He is having quite the January, averaging 21.8 points, 3.3 rebounds, 2.7 assists and 1.7 steals per game in six outings.

             Jokic was very productive, hitting 3-of-6 from behind the arc and 4-of-4 from the free-throw line, persevering despite a blowout on the scoreboard. He was one of just two Nuggets (Gary Harris) to go for double-digit point totals and please his fantasy owners. He also chipped in with nine rebounds, seven assists and steals. Jokic and his teammates have just three games on tap in the upcoming week, but favorable home games against the defensively-challenged Mavericks and Suns highlight the slate.

The two-point stinker snaps a career-high 10-game streak with double-digit points. He has hit just 2-of-14 (14.3 percent) from the field over the past two outings, as The Blue Arrow is in a bit of a funk. It didn't help facing a decent defensive club on their home court.

             He came in averaging 24.7 points over the past three games, with 2.7 triples, 5.7 rebounds, 2.0 assists and 0.7 steals, so owners should be willing to overlook tonight's rough shooting. Harris has only three games with more than two turnovers this season, which highlights his unique appeal in 9-cat leagues -- his 1.0 turnovers per game are third-lowest among players averaging 30+ minutes per game, trailing only Trevor Ariza and Otto Porter.

            Reggie Bullock missed a potentially game-tying layup at the buzzer vs. Chicago on Saturday, finishing with seven points on 3-of-9 shooting, five rebounds, two assists and one 3-pointer in 35 minutes.
        
        
             Stanley Johnson (hip) was out tonight due to tightness in his hip, which allowed Bullock to log unfettered minutes as the starting SF. Pistons coach Stan Van Gundy ruled out structural damage for Johnson, but Bullock should keep the starting gig even when he's healthy. He's been extremely efficient for the past month with 57.8% field goals and 83.3% free throws, while hitting 2.4 triples per game, so owners might as well ride the hot hand.

             Moreland had two turnovers but generally looked good, and he made some smart passes from the high post tonight. This will help him hold off Boban Marjanovic (DNP-CD) for backup-center minutes, but he's not a fantasy asset while Andre Drummond is healthy.

            Andre Drummond had another big all-around game on Saturday with 21 points (8-of-13 FGs, 5-of-6 FTs), 15 rebounds, four assists, three blocks, two steals and one turnover.
        
        
             Drummond committed just one turnover and two fouls in 34 minutes, and it's safe to conclude that his rib injury is no longer a concern. He missed one game on Jan. 6, but in the three games since he's averaging a stellar 19.7 points, 16.3 boards, 4.0 assists, 2.0 steals and 2.0 blocks. That was against a trio of vulnerable frontcourts, though, and he'll draw a tougher matchup vs. Dwight Howard on Monday. Trainers did look at Drummond's right foot in the second quarter tonight but he looked fine after halftime, so we'll leave him off the injury report.

             Parker didn't last long, but it wasn't due to any type of setback with his injury. He and the starters received plenty of rest in the second half, giving way to the reserve in a blowout victory. The Spurs are next in action on Monday afternoon in Atlanta. They have four games on tap in the upcoming week, but no back-to-back situations.

             Bradley added three rebounds, two steals, one assist and one block in 38 minutes vs. the Bulls tonight. Fantasy owners probably did a double-take when looking at the boxscore tonight, as this is the sixth time all season AB has made more than half of his shots. He's starting to warm up after missing a chunk of time with a groin injury, so hopefully owners' patience will continue to pay off.

             Mirotic missed one game due to illness but looked fine vs. Detroit tonight. He's eligible to be traded on Monday and teams like the Pistons and Jazz have been mentioned as possible suitors -- for now, the Bulls are reportedly holding out for a first-round draft pick. Heat coach Fred Hoiberg referred to playing Mirotic and Lauri Markkanen together as ""a fun lineup,"" so as long as he's with Chicago his role appears safe.

             Bertans was a very efficient 6-of-8 from the field, including 6-of-7 from behind the 3-point line. He and Manu Ginobili are the only Spurs to post six triples in a game this season. Bertans also accomplished the feat back on Jan. 8 against the Kings. He is having a nice January, posting 13.0 points per game while averaging 3.0 3-pointers per game. If you need triples Bertans is worth scooping up while running hot.

             Chicago opened the game 15-of-20 from the field against a listless defensive effort from Detroit, and they held on for an impressive 107-105 victory. Dunn has now recorded at least eight assists in six consecutive games, which is a career-long streak, and he's thriving as the undoubted starting PG for Chicago. Zach LaVine's return is primarily a threat to Denzel Valentine and David Nwaba, so Dunn's owners can keep him locked in active lineups going forward.

             Denzel Valentine shifted to the bench and logged 21 minutes tonight, while Paul Zipser found himself out of Chicago's rotation entirely. Zach LaVine (knee) was on a strict minute-limit and he sat out the fourth quarter, with Nwaba playing all 12 minutes, so that artificially inflated his playing time. Feel free to cut him for a more promising rest-of-season option.

             The Bulls kept LaVine on a 20-minute limit and he sat out the fourth quarter by design, but he looked spry while on the court tonight. Fred Hoiberg expects to keep LaVine around 20 minutes the next few games, after which his playing time should slowly ramp up -- it helps that Chicago doesn't play back-to-back games until Feb. 9-10. He played a handful of minutes at PG tonight, which is even more encouraging, and his fantasy owners are finally being rewarded for their patience.

            C.J. Miles came off the bench for eight points (2-of-9 FGs, 2-of-4 FTs), two rebounds and one assist in 22 minutes on Saturday.
        
        
             Miles started Thursday's game with Serge Ibaka suspended, and wound up scoring 16 points. His playing time was actually up tonight, going north of 20 minutes for the first time since Dec. 27, but we're not reading into it. Toronto needed him to spread the court as they clawed back from a big deficit, and Miles forced up a heavily-contested 3-point attempt late in the fourth quarter. There are better perimeter specialists on the wire in most leagues.

             The free throws set a career-high for Anunoby, which is noteworthy since he's usually just a spot-up 3-point shooter. Amazingly, the rookie ranks 3rd in the NBA in net rating, with Toronto outscoring opponents by 14.2 points per 100 possessions while he's on the court. That astounding metric doesn't mean he has fantasy value, unfortunately, as he's been hurting owners outside of the deepest formats.

             Wright went 1-of-4 from the field and 2-of-2 at the free throw line tonight. He's struggled over his past two starts with averages of 5.0 points on 30.8% shooting, showing some growing pains in a starting role without Kyle Lowry (tailbone). He was heating up as a featured option with the second unit and Lowry is just day-to-day, so owners should stay patient for at least a few more games.

             Kyle Lowry was out again with a bruised tailbone but he's day-to-day and could return as soon as Monday vs. the 76ers. VanVleet was instrumental in the Raptors' second-half run tonight, and this comes on the heels of Thursday's 22-point outburst, so maybe he'll earn more minutes regardless. Most owners should take a wait-and-see approach.

             Ibaka contributed to Toronto's incredible second-half comeback, cutting what was once a 27-point deficit to just one point late in the fourth quarter, but they couldn't get over the hump. He didn't have any assists, steals or blocks tonight -- it's the fourth time all season that's happened, so owners can expect better vs. Philly on Monday.

             DeRozan was phenomenal but Toronto's defense was the issue, as they gave up 81 points in the first half and trailed by as many as 27 points tonight. He added five rebounds, three assists and two turnovers in 38 minutes, with a huge usage rate in the absence of Kyle Lowry (tailbone). As a footnote, DeRozan's big game tonight also pushed him past Vince Carter as the Raptors' all-time leader in games with 30+ points (92 games). He's surging as a top-20 value over the past month.

             Leonard was aggressive on the offensive end, getting to the free-throw line a season-high 11 times, converting nine attempts. He was not tentative in his return to action, and he picked up four steals, too. He has four or more thefts in four straight games, the longest stretch of his career. He was limited to 28 minutes, but that was more the result of the lopsided nature of the score and not due to any type of setback with his shoulder.

             The Warriors dropped 81 points in the first half tonight, the first time they've accomplished that since 1990, yet they still had to fight for this road win in Toronto. McCaw went 2-of-4 from the field and 2-of-2 from the line, and it was the Warriors' veterans who did the heavy lifting -- Zaza Pachulia was the only starter to play fewer than 34 minutes. McCaw isn't worth owning while the starters are healthy.

He did a pretty solid job subbing for Otto Porter Jr. when he was hurt, and he hasn't skipped a beat heading back to the bench. However, as long as OPJ is healthy, Oubre is best used in deeper fantasy leagues only.

Inconsistency is a given for a rookie on a championship contender, but DNP-CDs are unsustainable. Bell has proven what he can do in 20+ minutes but it's time to consider safer options in most scenarios.

If you're wondering what sixteen is in Polish, and who wouldn't be, it's 'szesnascie'. Wall has managed nine or more assists in each of his six January outings, and seven in a row.

             Iguodala was walking gingerly after a drive in the first half and Steve Kerr confirmed afterward that he was ""dealing with some hip issues,"" although the Warriors haven't provided an official injury update. We should get clarification after Sunday's practice, and there's no doubt he'll be on the injury report prior to Monday's game in Cleveland.

            Marcin Gortat was an efficient 6-of-8 from the field Saturday against the Nets, finishing with 16 points, 13 rebounds, two assists, a steal and a blocked shot over 30 minutes.
        
        
             The Polish Hammer didn't disappoint on Polish Heritage Night at the Verizon Center in D.C. Before the game Gortat took pictures and honored a couple of Polish World War II veterans, and it was a huge turnout in the nation's capital. Fantasy owners were pleased with Gortat's line. He has back-to-back double-doubles for the first time since a three-game run with 10 or more points and 10 or more rebounds from Nov. 17-20. Na zdrowie, Marcin!

            Caris LeVert's shot was off again in Saturday's overtime loss in Washington, but he was able to finish with 12 points, eight rebounds and eight assists over 35 minutes.
        
        
             LeVert had an ugly 5-of-16 shooting night, including 1-of-7 from behind the 3-point line, and he is shooting just 34.4 percent (21-of-61) in five games in the month of January. With his shot not falling, he contributed in other ways, posting a season-high eight boards while his dimes were his third-most of the season. In the second half of the season you can expect the Nets to lean heavily on their younger players, and that means LeVert could see an even larger role down the stretch.

             Dinwiddie was able to chip in with six rebounds, four assists, a steal and a blocked shot to salvage the line for fantasy owners in standard leagues, but his awful field-goal percentage killed those in 9-cat formats. Chalk it up as one bad outing. More worrisome is the impending return of D'Angelo Russell, and how that will be handled. For now, head coach Kenny Atkinson has said he's considering starting both of them together, but it will be interesting to see whether his fantasy value takes a hit or not.

             Allen also added eight rebounds and an assist with just one turnover while finishing with a respectable plus-8 rating. He also scored 16 points on New Year's Day against the Magic. The rookie out of the University of Texas has shown some glimpses of brilliance in the month of January, posting 14 or more points in three of his seven games. Allen isn't someone to rely upon in the starting lineup just yet, but he is a nice stash option for his potential in the blocked shots department.

             Hollis-Jefferson has posted career highs in two of his past four outings. He snagged a career-high 17 rebounds on Jan. 8 against the Raptors, now this solid performance in the assists column. He continues to do a good job in the Brooklyn frontcourt, and he might see even heavier minutes going forward if the team elects to move DeMarre Carroll. He has some nice mid-round value in 9-cat fantasy leagues with a little bit of upside.

             Carroll finished 6-of-13 from the field, including 1-of-6 from behind the arc, while he was able to post his second double-double in five January outings. That's now five double-doubles in 2017-18, which is a new career high in a single season. Carroll has managed just five total double-doubles over his past three seasons (2014-17) combined. He looked much better than he did Friday in Atlanta, as he made his way back from a two-game absence due to a knee injury. Carroll remains a decent source of cheap rebounds, steals and 3-pointers.

             Graham hit 2-of-3 from the field and he picked up three personal fouls with a minus-6 rating in his limited work. The former VCU standout exploded for 14 points on Dec. 23, but he has just 39 total points in eight games since. He is averaging just over 16 minutes per game in five January outings, so he is part of the rotation. But he shouldn't be trusted outside of the deepest of fantasy formats unless something happens to Nicolas Batum to create a larger role.

             Monk has played 12 minutes in two of the past three games sandwiched around a DNP-CD. He still has a ways to go before becoming a regular in the rotation, and a team-worst minus-11 rating in limited action isn't likely to precipitate a change to his role. He isn't worth owning in most fantasy leagues at this time.

             An awful shooting percentage (28.2 percent) and high turnover rate has had him nailed to the bench lately. However, he has started to show some signs of life in January shooting 61.5 percent (8-of-13) with just two turnovers across 70 minutes over five games in the month of January. He might be potentially working his way back into a larger role, but he still cannot be trusted by fantasy owners outside of the deepest leagues.

The result is that Kyle Anderson, Bryn Forbes and Dejounte Murray are back in their typical bench roles, which should result in severely cut playing time. Anderson is still worth holding, though, at least while Rudy Gay (heel) is on the shelf.

While the Hornets were outrebounded just 57-50 overall, it was 19-9 in ORB which hurt Buzz City. While Williams snagged nine rebounds, he had none on the offensive end.

             Batum was able to hit a pair of 3-pointers while adding three rebounds, two assists, a steal and a blocked shot, but he also turned it over four times. He just hasn't been himself this season, and he started out behind the 8-ball with a rather serious elbow injury to start. It's uncertain if the ailment continues to bother him more than he is saying, but something is amiss, much to the dismay of his fantasy owners.

             This was the second solid outing in a row for Johnson, but these games do come with a bit of an asterisk as both were against Sacramento's porous defense. Sam Dekker also had a nice game with 13 points, five boards, one assist, one steal and one turnover in 19 minutes, but with how inconsistent these guys have been this season, we'll need to see a repeat before getting behind adding either of them.

             Both Kawhi Leonard (shoulder) and Danny Green (groin) are also expected to play Saturday night. Parker's return was anticipated, as he told reporters he could have played Thursday, ""but you know the Spurs, they are going to just be cautious."" Dejounte Murray will get bumped back to the bench with Parker in the starting five.

             Harrell should be flirting with minutes in the mid-20s while DeAndre Jordan (ankle) is on the sidelines, which is enough floor time for him to make a meaningful impact in fantasy hoops. Jordan's ankle injury doesn't seem very serious, but if you picked up Harrell during his recent three-game hot streak, you might as well just keep him until he gives you a reason to send him to the wire.

            Jerami Grant finished with nine points, three rebounds, an assist and a blocked shot across 21 minutes off the bench Saturday in Charlotte.
        
        
             Grant didn't take a lot of shots, but he didn't miss any. He was a perfect 3-of-3 from the field, including 1-of-1 from behind the arc, and he was 2-of-2 from the charity stripe, too. Grant was pretty sharp in this one, but he continues to have a rather minimal role in the OKC offense. Head coahc Billy Donovan lets the game dictate whether he uses Grant or Patrick Peterson alongside Steven Adams with the second unit. That makes it difficult to trust Grant outside of the deepest leagues.

             It's a very positive sign that Wallace has been able to log significant minutes with Milos Teodosic getting back to the court, and he's played very well since entering the rotation five games ago with averages of 13.2 points, 2.0 assists, 1.4 steals, 0.8 blocks and 1.2 turnovers per game on 48.9% shooting from the field and 79.2% from the line. He'll likely fall off once Austin Rivers (heel) and Danilo Gallinari (glute) get back to the court, but neither of those guys are close, and Wallace has played well enough to warrant a roster spot in most leagues.

             It was just another average night at the office for Westbrook, who hit 10-of-27 from the field while hitting 5-of-7 from the free-throw line. He has managed at least one steal in 19 consecutive games, perhaps an underrated part of his game. Better yet, he has turned the ball over just seven total times over the past two outings.

             As we saw last season in Miami when Hassan Whiteside was forced to the sidelines for a brief period, Reed is capable of consistently bringing this sort of effort when given the minutes, so he could be someone to consider as a speculative add in deep leagues if you've got someone to cut. Just know that he'll return to being a negligible fantasy option once Jordan returns to the court, so we wouldn't advise cutting anyone with long-term appeal.

             Ferguson is holding down the fort with Andre Roberson (knee), but really the latter cannot return soon enough. He was just 1-of-3 from the field, and he is averaging just 2.0 PPG over the past four outings. Even in a starting role, should Roberson need more time to mend, Ferguson warrants very little in the way of fantasy consideration. He isn't even worth using as a low-end DFS play at this point.

             Ugly shooting has been a consistent issue for Griffin this season, who is currently connecting on a career-worst 42.9% of his shot attempts. Some of that has to do with the fact that he's jacking up a career-high 5.7 triples per contest, but the lack of spacing in Los Angeles hasn't done him any favors either. That said, he's still managed to produce top-60 value on the year and there's room for improvement, so he's someone to think about as a buy-low target.

             Sweet Lou again led the Clippers in scoring as he paved the way to victory, adding four triples, one rebound, two assists, four steals and two turnovers in 35 minutes of action. Williams isn't likely to be traded this season, but it's worth pointing out that this torrid streak has come with Austin Rivers (heel) and Danilo Gallinari (glute) watching from the sidelines, so owners may want to consider selling high as his value could dip once those guys return to the court.

             Bogdanovic is arguably Sacramento's best player, so it should only be a matter of time until he finds himself in the starting five. He's been rolling over the past four games with averages of 17.5 points, 4.0 assists, 1.8 triples and just 0.8 turnovers per game on 58.1% shooting, and with the potential to get unleashed after the All-Star break, he's someone to consider swooping up in most leagues.

The only areas he has seen improvement is in steals per game (2.2 SPG) while hitting 3-pointers at a career-high clip (43.5 percent).

            Willie Cauley-Stein double-doubled in Saturday's loss to the Clippers, finishing with 23 points, 13 rebounds, four assists, one steal, one block and two turnovers in 33 minutes.
        
        
             As an added bonus, WCS knocked down his second career 3-pointer in this one, although we wouldn't expect that to develop into a trend considering he's shooting just 28.6% from long-range this year on seven attempts. Cauley-Stein's minutes have been all over the place this season, and he's not bringing many defensive stats to the table, so he's probably not going to be much more than a late-round guy this year.

             Malone likes what he's seen out of the old guy and wants to see ""what we have"" in him until further notice. Jefferson is 37 years old, so we're pretty sure Malone already knows what he has and only owners in super deep leagues need to take notice of this news. He had one rebound in two minutes on Sunday. Yee-haw.

He is 8-of-33 (24.2 percent) from the field over the past two outings, and went without a triple for just the second time in the past 13 games. His scoring is nearly five points down per game than last season in New York, and roughly seven per outing off of his career numbers.

             This was an unfortunate step in the wrong direction following Thursday's 21-point outburst, and it wouldn't be shocking to see the 31-year-old's minutes start to dwindle as we approach the second half of the season. Hill has been consistently inconsistent this season, and he doesn't have much going for him in Sacramento, so we'd recommend letting someone else deal with him.

             This was Fox's second-career double-double and both of his dub-dubs have come over the past four games. Aside from some lame shooting (he went 6-of-17 from the field tonight), Fox has been playing very well since getting back from the quad injury, and it's encouraging that despite George Hill's return he's still managed to see his minutes in the mid-30s. He could be a strong second half player, so make sure he's not floating around on your waiver wire.

             Ingram said he wasn't really able to push off his left ankle when he tried to play through the injury, but he'll try and run on it on Sunday and see how he feels. He wants to play on Monday in Memphis but said it will depend on how he feels, so he could be trending towards a game-time decision. Owners can expect to get another update on Sunday, but if he's out on MLK day, more minutes would fall to Kyle Kuzma and Julius Randle, while Josh Hart could earn a start.

            Harrison Barnes scored 17 points on 7-of-21 shooting Saturday to go with one 3-pointer, five rebounds, three assists, two steals and one turnover in 39 minutes.
        
        
             Barnes got off to a sluggish start in this one, but he really started to get going during crunch time, rocking a 37.0 usage rate during the fourth quarter and banking in a tough shot with six seconds left in regulation to send the game into overtime. The shooting wasn't pretty, but we'd expect a more efficient outing on Tuesday in Denver.

            J.J. Barea did not play during the second half on Saturday after aggravating a groin injury, finishing with five points, one 3-pointer, three rebounds, three assists and one turnover in 19 minutes.
        
        
             Rick Carlisle said he had ""no idea"" on the severity of Barea's injury after the game, so he's likely headed for an MRI. That said, groin injuries can be tricky, so it wouldn't be surprising at all to see this result in an extended absence for the 33-year-old veteran, and if he does need to miss time that would open up minutes for Dennis Smith Jr. and Yogi Ferrell. The Mavs take on the Nuggets on Tuesday, so we should get another update on Barea in the intervening days.

The Bulls can officially trade Mirotic on January 15, so this could be his final game in a Chicago uniform.

He's likely going to be a game-time call, but if Harris is able to get back out there tonight, Will Barton will head back to the bench and his value will suffer a slight hit. Stay tuned.

             Matthews has been rolling over the past few weeks, flirting with top-50 value in 9-cat leagues behind averages of 15.1 points, 3.4 dimes, 2.6 triples and just 0.7 turnovers per contest on 45.9% shooting from the field and 83.3% from the charity stripe. This is probably going to be the high water mark for Matthews this season, as his playing time could begin to dwindle after the All-Star break, so now would be good opportunity to try and sell-high on the 31-year-old swingman.

             Ferrell also added four assists, one 3-pointer and one steal in the loss, and he tends to play well when given the minutes. As a starter this season, Ferrell has produced averages of 12.1 points, 2.1 triples, 3.7 boards, 3.3 assists and just 1.1 turnovers per game on 43.9% shooting, so as long as he’s starting, he’s worth owning in deep leagues.

             Smith Jr. came out firing in this one, looking for his shot early and often while relentlessly attacking the rack, and he did a nice job defensively against Lonzo Ball which helped him stay on the floor. It’s been an up-and-down season for DSJ, as Rick Carlisle has made him have to earn everything, but this is his upside and he could be in for a strong second half to the season if he can keep playing like this. ""I thought he earned the minutes,"" Rick Carlisle said after the game. ""This is a game all of our young guys will learn from.""

             Clarkson caught fire down the stretch, scoring 11 of his 19 points in the fourth quarter and overtime while rocking a 30.4 usage rate, and there really wasn't anything the Mavs could do to stop him. The Lakers are reportedly looking to ship Clarkson out of Los Angeles, so he probably bumped up his trade stock a bit with his clutch performance. In terms of fantasy hoops, a trade wouldn't necessarily be a bad thing for Clarkson, as his minutes have been sporadic with the Lakers this season.

             Kuzma was on fire to start the game, and he didn’t even miss his first shot until late in the third quarter, finishing 8-of-13 from the field and 1-of-2 from the charity stripe. Brandon Ingram exited the game with an ankle sprain, and Larry Nance Jr. hit the sidelines after a cut opened up above his eye, so Kuzma be in line for big minutes on Monday if both those guys are out.

             Russell has been going through full-contact practices with Brooklyn's G-League affiliate, which suggests he's on the cusp of a return, so while he won't be taking the court tonight, he needs to be owned everywhere. He's next opportunity to play will come on Monday at home against the Knicks.

            Kentavious Caldwell-Pope went 5-of-8 from the field and 5-of-8 from the stripe on his way to 17 points, five boards, two 3-pointers and one turnover in 41 minutes on Saturday.
        
        
             Caldwell-Pope was quiet for much of the game, but he came through with some big shots in the clutch to keep the Lakers in the game. That said, KCP’s minutes have been rather sporadic lately, and the fact that his usage has dipped to 15.4 over the past six is concerning. The Lakers value his expiring contract more than his on-court contributions, so it wouldn’t be shocking to see him lose minutes to someone like Josh Hart through this second half of the season.

             Myles Turner (elbow) has already been ruled out for Sunday's game, and the Pacers may want to play it safe with Sabonis with Sunday being the first game of a back-to-back set. If he's out, Al Jefferson would have the chance to start and there would be more minutes available for T.J. Leaf. Check back for another update following Sunday morning's shootaround.

             This will be Turner's third straight game on the sidelines, and with Domantas Sabonis (shoulder) being listed as questionable for Sunday's game, Al Jefferson could potentially be looking at a start. Sunday will be the first game of a back-to-back set for the Pacers, so that may have factored into Indiana's decision to keep him on the sidelines with the sore elbow, but perhaps he'll be able to get back out there on Monday in Utah. Stay tuned.

             Sefolosha suffered the injury during Friday's loss to the Hornets, and unfortunately, his season is over. Jonas Jerebko will likely be the Jazz's starting four-man until Rudy Gobert (knee) can get back to the court, and Sefolosha's absence should also open up some minutes for Joe Johnson. However, neither Johnson nor Jerebko offers enough upside to warrant a pick up in most 12-team leagues. Sefolosha's timetable is expected to be set at six months, so he should be cut everywhere.

            Rudy Gobert (knee) was re-evaluated on Saturday and it was determined that he'll need to spend another 7-10 days on the sidelines.
        
        
             Gobert has recently begun going through light practices with non-contact work, so he is making progress. That said, until he's going through 5-on-5, full-contact work, we can assume he's not close. Derrick Favors will continue to hold down the five-spot in his absence, with Thabo Sefolosha and Jonas Jerebko moving in and out of the starting five based on the matchup.

             Ingram tweaked his ankle during the first quarter and tried to play through it after getting his ankle re-taped in the locker room, but after a second trip to the locker room the Lakers ruled him out for the remainder of the game. He'll end his evening with four points, six boards, five dimes in 14 minutes, and for now, we'll be considering him questionable for Monday's game in Memphis. His absence would translate to more minutes for Kyle Kuzma, Larry Nance and Julius Randle. Stay tuned.

             ""I'm not a doctor, but there's a chance,"" said Beverley when asked about a possible return this season. We'd take these comments with an enormous grain of salt and highlight the whole ""I'm not a doctor"" part of his statement. Beverley underwent both microfracture and arthroscopic surgery on his right knee, which is nothing to shrug at, so it would be quite shocking to see him back on the court this season. For what it's worth, he said he'd start traveling with the team in February.

Stay tuned.

             The good news is Rivers told reporters that he doesn't think Jordan will miss much time and that Jordan wanted to play on Saturday. Willie Reed will draw the start in place of Jordan at center on Saturday. However, Montrezl Harrell could be the biggest beneficiary from a fantasy standpoint. Harrell scored a season-high 25 points (on 11-of-12 shooting) and added six rebounds and a steal in 27 minutes on Thursday.

Nick Young and Patrick McCaw could see additional minutes off the Warriors bench if Iggy is unable to play.

             Dallas initially signed Collinsworth to a two-way contract back in December, but then waived him last week to open up a roster spot for Jalen Jones. Collinsworth can be ignored in all fantasy formats, as he is unlikely to crack the Mavs rotation.

The Magic, who are playing for ping pong balls at this point, have absolutely no reason to rush him back. He should be left on waivers in all re-draft leagues.

However, this is merely a game-notes designation, so we will have to wait until later this afternoon for a more reliable update on Curry's status. It was reported on Friday that Steph has a ""solid chance"" to return on Saturday and that the Warriors kept him out of Friday's game primarily because it was the front end of a back-to-back. If Curry can play, Patrick McCaw will get bumped back to the bench.

             Ulis will see a larger role as long as Isaiah Canaan (groin) is on the shelf, but he'll have to do much better than this.

The good news is he is averaging 6.7 assists and 2.0 steals per game with just 1.3 turnovers during the span. Even with the added responsibilities with Canaan out, he remains useful only in the deepest of fantasy formats.

The only complaint from fantasy owners might be his ugly nine turnovers, which was a season high. He has four or more turnovers in five of his past six outings, so fantasy owners have to take the good with the bad. Usually with Booker, it's way more good than bad.

            T.J. Warren finished with 21 points in Friday's 112-95 loss against the Rockets, hitting 10-of-17 from the field.
        
        
             Warren is averaging 22.0 points over the past two games since returning from a one-game absence due to illness. He has been shooting the ball well over his past 11 outings, 53.5 percent from the floor. He has been one of the most reliable fantasy producers in the Valley of the Sun this season, and he is posting top-75 roto value for most owners.

             Green's point total wasn't bad, but he was just 3-of-14 from the field, including 1-of-9 from behind the 3-point line. He helped himself with a 5-of-5 night at the free-throw stripe. He'll continue to have some fantasy appeal with added minutes until James Harden (hamstring) is healthy enough to make his way back.

             It was Gordon's worst shooting night since a 2-of-12 night in Utah back on Dec. 7. He was still able to extend his streak with two or more 3-pointers to 13 straight outings, and he has at least one triple in 25 straight outings dating back to Nov. 14. He'll continue jacking up shots and will be a secondary or tertiary scoring option behind Chris Paul until James Harden (hamstring) is able to return to the lineup.

             Anderson stepped up with Tarik Black (eye) and Nene Hilario (knee) on the shelf. He hit 6-of-12 from the field, including 4-of-7 from behind the arc, while adding 2-of-2 from the free-throw stripe. The 18 points were his most since Dec. 7 in Utah. It was a much-needed solid shooting night for Anderson, as he had a four-game streak with single-digit point totals, and nine or fewer points in seven of his past eight.

             He struggled from the line (2-of-5 FTs), but it was another solid outing for Lyles with five rebounds, one assist, one steal and two turnovers in 29 minutes. He failed to hit a 3-pointer for the first time since Dec. 8 and has been a top-70 value in standard category leagues for the past month, and the only thing that can slow him down is the eventual return of Paul Millsap (wrist).

             In case you were wondering, Capela's career high is 20 rebounds. He also chopped in with three assists, two steals and a blocked shot over 36 minutes while going an efficient 7-of-11 from the floor. He also tied a team-high with a plus-22 rating in the road win. Capela is on fire lately, averaging 14.8 points, 12.4 rebounds and 1.6 blocked shots per game over his past five outings. He and his teammates will have the weekend to rest up before a road outing Monday against the Clippers.

             Bledsoe added four rebounds, four steals and three assists while also going 2-of-2 from the charity stripe. He has posted at least one 3-pointer in each of his seven games in January, and he has at least one steal in each of his past 10 outings, averaging 2.5 swipes during the stretch. Bledsoe isn't required to do as much heavy lifting on the offensive end as his days in Phoenix, but he still does a good job chipping in across the board to make him a top-50 fantasy option since arriving in Wisconsin.

Beasley drew strong praise from his teammates and coaches for his defense tonight and coach Malone won't hesitate to turn to him again on Saturday if Harris is still away from the team. He'll be a streaming consideration in deeper formats on a seven-game Saturday.

             That's more like it. Barton was cold coming into tonight's game with January averages of 11.6 points, 5.2 assists, 2.0 rebounds, 0.4 steals and 1.6 triples on 35.9% shooting, so he was in need of a confidence booster.  Harris was tending to a ""private family matter"" and could be back on Saturday, so Barton will be back on the bench if that happens. He's worth owning even when his shot isn't falling, as his assists give him a decent floor.

If fantasy owners want something to complain about, he was 0-of-3 from behind the 3-point line and he has just one double-double in seven games so far in January. However, even when he has a subpar game he is still pretty good for his fantasy owners.

It likely won't get him closer to supplanting Malcolm Brogdon in the starting five, but it won't hurt, either. He is worth scooping up in all fantasy leagues if available, as he could easily move back into the starting five sooner rather than later if Brogdon hits the skids.

            Kevon Looney finished with nine points, eight rebounds, three assists and a blocked shot across 23 minutes Friday in Milwaukee, his hometown.
        
        
             Looney connected on 3-of-3 from the field, and he was 3-of-4 from the free-throw line. He could carry over the momentum into Saturday's game at Toronto and be a nice low-cost DFS option, especially if Kevin Durant (calf) is unavailable in the back-to-back set. Circle back around Saturday for the latest on KD, as Looney could be one of the biggest beneficiaries of his potential absence.

             He scored 20+ points in 10 of his previous 12 games, so credit to Denver's defense for slowing him down. The Grizzlies are shopping Evans' expiring contract and want a first-round pick in return, but Evans brushed off the rumors. ""I know it’s a business, I just gotta come and work, do what I do every day. I can’t, that’s not in my hands,"" he said. ""So, whether they trade me or they keep me, I’m coming to work every day, work hard, and just get better.""

             Durant was a solid 12-of-20 from the field, including 2-of-6 from behind the arc. If fantasy owners really want to quibble, they can find fault in his 0-of-2 night at the free-throw line and zero blocked shots. But don't be greedy. Circle back around tomorrow afternoon to double-check that he'll be available for Saturday night's game at Toronto, as he is fresh off a strained right calf and his status in back-to-back situations is uncertain.

            Klay Thompson finished with 12 points Friday at Milwaukee, but he was 0-of-2 from behind the arc to snap a 95-game streak with at least one 3-pointer made.
        
        
             Thompson was back from a rest on Wednesday, but apparently it hindered him more than it helped. His 95-game stretch with a triple was the third-longest in NBA history. He wasn't terribly broken up about it after the game, though. ""I didn't know. Oh well. Who cares?,"" he said. With Thompson back in action it was Nick Young heading back to a minor role off the bench.

             These types of nights are maddening for fantasy owners, as Rondo can be so special at times and look rather disinterested and uninvolved other times. He is just two games removed from posting 15 assists, and he has 12 or more dimes in three of his past eight with a few stinkers in between. The tease of elite-level assists makes him worth owning in most formats, but be ready for duds like this now and again.

             Gasol hit 8-of-19 shots and all five of his free throws, adding two assists, one block and one triple in 36 minutes. The Grizzlies are tied with the Kings for the worst record in the West and Gasol has voiced his frustration many times, so it's no secret that he'll be a popular trade candidate at the deadline. ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski reported early this week that the Grizzlies are still planning to keep him, but a lot can change in just a few weeks.

             Miller also contributed two assists, a blocked shot and was 6-of-6 from the free-throw stripe. It was a much needed performance, as he had single-digit point totals in each of his past seven outings. He is a solid fantasy option for his work behind the 3-point line, as he ranks in the Top 10 in 3-point field goal percentage. However, he remains useful mostly to those in deeper formats at this time.

            Damian Lillard (right calf strain) was in the lineup Friday at New Orleans, and he finished with 23 points across 38 minutes.
        
        
             Lillard didn't play with any type of minutes cap, and he hit 9-of-22 from the floor while adding eight assists, three steals and two rebounds. His shot was a bit off, and he was just 2-of-11 from behind the 3-point line, too, but whenever he is in the lineup he is an obvious must-start across the board in all fantasy formats.

            C.J. McCollum finished with 23 points Friday in New Orleans, hitting four 3-pointers while adding four assists and four rebounds.
        
        
             McCollum shot 40.0 percent from behind the arc, banging home 4-of-10, and he added a steal and a blocked shot over his 36 minutes. He was one of four Portland starters to tally at least two triples on the evening. McCollum will look to match a season-high streak of six in a row with 20 or more points when his team plays Sunday night in the Twin Cities against the Timberwolves.

             It was a step in the right direction after he looked rusty in his return on Wednesday with just eight points over 26 minutes. He was 3-of-11 from the field tonight, but playing 33 minutes in just his second back is a really good sign. It won't be long before he's churning out top-75 value again and that's being conservative.  He gets a matchup with the Blazers on Sunday.

             Nurkic was a very efficient 7-of-9 from the field and 5-of-6 from the charity stripe while adding five rebounds, three blocked shots, two assists and a steal. The Pelicans didn't do very well on interior defense and Nurk was able to take advantage. It was a very nice bounce back game after his dud Wednesday in Houston snapped a five-game streak with 10 or more points.

             Aminu hit 7-of-16 from the floor, including 3-of-9 from behind the arc, and he finished with a team-best plus-16 rating. In fact, he was the only Blazers player in double digits in the category. This was a nice game, but he has posted some pretty awful stat lines lately, too. In fact, he has yet to post back-to-back double-digit scoring totals so far through seven games in January. He is a bit erratic in terms of fantasy production, but remains a decent add in category leagues, especially 9-cat.

             When Payton is struggling, there is talk that his crazy hairdo gets in the way and affects his shooting vision. He entered the game with just 7.0 points, 5.5  assists and 1.5 rebounds per game over his past two contests, so the talk was creeping in again. This will silence the critics, as he banged home his only 3-pointer attempt and was 8-of-9 from the free-throw line, too.

             He's been remarkably consistent and this was just his fourth game under 20 points since the beginning of December. The Wolves have been on another level defensively and held each of their last seven opponents below 100 points before tonight. ""Now we're taking pride in our defense,"" Butler said. ""We're taking it personal with matchups. I like to see that."" The Wolves are 11 games over .500 for the first time since the end of the 2003-04 season and the strong play of Karl-Anthony Towns and Butler is the reason why.

             Simmons was also a perfect 6-of-6 from the charity stripe, but he did not contribute anything in the rebound, steal or blocked shot departments. Fantasy owners can't complain too vehemently, though, as the scoring total was solid and he really helped everyone's field-goal and free-throw percentages. The good news is that he appears to be over back spasms which were hindering him earlier in the week.

             He was 9-of-15 from the field and 3-of-4 from the line, becoming just the third player this season (Russell Westbrook, LeBron James) to record  23+ points, 15+ rebounds and 9+ assists. This was the third game of his career with nine or more assists and he now has a double-double in eight straight. He's been a monster lately and it's no coincidence that the Wolves have won each of their last four games by 10+ points, tied for the second-longest streak in franchise history.

             Biyombo was outstanding, hitting 8-of-9 from the field and 5-of-6 from the free-throw stripe. The Zaire native continues to be a decent fantasy option when the matchup is favorable, as he fills in for the injured Nikola Vucevic (hand).

             Gordon was a dismal 4-of-15 from the field, although he was still able to connect for 3-of-6 from behind the 3-point line while flirting with a triple-double. He was late for a team flight earlier in the week, benched in Dallas, and he just hasn't recovered in his two games back in the starting lineup. He is shooting just 8-of-33 (24.2 percent) over the past two outings. Still, the double-double was nice and remains a fantasy option in most formats through thick and thin.

We'll chalk this up as an off night and his owners should look for him to bounce back on Monday vs. the Spurs. He added three rebounds, one assist, one steal and one block.

             Fantasy owners won't be terribly pleased with the off shooting night, and the fact he chipped in with just two assists, two rebounds and two steals.

            Dennis Schroder's career-high of 34 points weren't enough in a 110-105 loss to the Nets on Friday.
        
        
             Schroder was getting whatever he wanted, but that's not a surprise with the Nets allowing the third most fantasy points to PGs this season. He finished 14-of-26 from the field, 3-of-3 from the line and 3-of-5 from beyond the arc, adding seven assists, three rebounds and three steals in 32 minutes. This was the sixth game of his career with 30+ points and second of the season, and now he gets a couple days off to prepare for Monday's matchup with the Spurs.

            Marcin Gortat was able to post 12 points and 11 rebounds over 27 minutes despite a bit of foul trouble on Friday against the Magic.
        
        
             Gortat picked up four personal fouls in his 27 minutes, so Ian Mahinmi stepped up and posted a season-high 17 points to fill the void. He and Mahinmi had their way with the Nikola Vucevic-less (hand) Magic, and only Bismack Biyombo was offering any resistance down low. Gortat and the Wiz are back in action in a very favorable home matchup against the defensively-challenged Nets on Saturday night.

             Mahimni also chipped in with an assist, a steal and just one turnover in his 21 minutes while connecting on 7-of-8 from the field. He saw some extended minutes with Marcin Gortat in a bit of foul trouble, excelling against a rather soft Orlando middle still missing Nikola Vucevic (hand). Despite the solid performance, Mahinmi remains nothing more than a deep-league fantasy asset as long as Gortat remains healthy.

             Okafor had 11 of Brooklyn’s first 14 points in the fourth quarter and finished 6-of-8 from the field and 5-of-6 from the line with one assist, zero rebounds and one turnover. Coach Kenny Atkinson said he was glad to see that Okafor's hard work is starting to pay off and called him a beast after the game. The Nets are still using four different guys at center, so it will be hard to trust Okafor until Atkinson shortens the rotation.

             He also added a steal, three triples and three turnovers in 30 minutes, and he carried the Nets down the stretch -- he went coast-to-coast to hit the go-ahead layup and knocked down a pair of free throws with nine seconds left to seal the deal. He's becoming a star right before our eyes and the Nets will figure out a way to make sure he stays relevant when D'Angelo Russell comes back -- coach Kenny Atkinson said he's considering starting them together.

             Jefferson was sharp in his second game back, hitting 4-of-7 from the field. He is seeing expanded minutes and a renewed role with Myles Turner (elbow) on the shelf. As soon as Turner is healthy enough to play, potentially as soon as Sunday in Phoenix, Jefferson's role is expected to shrink again. As such, don't count on him outside of the very deepest of fantasy leagues at this point.

             Harris loses a good bit of value with DeMarre Carroll back in the lineup, but he's still a nice source of 3-pointers in 14- or 16-team leagues. He was 4-of-6 from the field tonight and has hit at least two triples in four out of his last five games. He gets a matchup with the Wizards on Saturday and should see minutes in the lower to mid-20s again.

             Stephenson did what he does best -- he gave the team a nice injection of offense and defense off the bench, and he got under the skin of LeBron James at one point, causing the four-time MVP to shove him away. He also added four assists, a steal and a blocked shot to make his fantasy owners smile from ear to ear. He'll look to keep it going on Monday in Phoenix in a very favorable matchup.

             Collison also contributed four assists, two steals and two rebounds while adding a 3-pointer, and he was best among all Indiana starters with a plus-8 rating. It was a nice bounce-back game after his seven-point stinker against Miami on Wednesday. The 22 points are his most since he dropped 30 in Chicago on Dec. 29. He'll face a favorable matchup on the road against Phoenix on Sunday, as the Suns allow an NBA-worst 112.1 PPG.

             Needless to say, Carroll didn't look limited at all and the Nets felt comfortable enough to play him for 28 minutes -- that's a good sign considering how cautious they are. ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski reported earlier this week that ""teams are targeting the availability"" of Carroll, but he may not lose a lot of value if he's moved because he's not a high-usage player anyways. If Carroll was dropped and you need steals, triples and boards, go pick him up.

             Sabonis was a beast on the glass, and he might have done a little more if not for four personal fouls. It was a good matchup against the small-ball Cavs, and he excelled in place of the injured Myles Turner (elbow). He has some short-term fantasy appeal heading into Sunday's game in Phoenix as long as Turner remains on the shelf, and Sabonis is a great value in DFS with a low salary and plenty of upside.

             Lamb is easily having the best season of his career, but the Hornets don't rely on him too much when their roster is healthy. He's played 26 or fewer minutes in each of his last eight games, but he's still been productive with 12.5 points, 4.6 rebounds, 1.8 assists, 1.2 steals and 1.0 triples in that span. He's a decent player to keep on the end of your roster and he could benefit if the Hornets are sellers at the trade deadline.

Batum is averaging 9.8 points, 4.6 assists, 4.4 rebounds and 1.0 triples over his last five games, numbers you wouldn't expect from a guy who is owed nearly $100 million over the next four seasons.

             The Cavaliers are looking for all kinds of combinations to snap out of their current funk, and has been playing an increase allotment of minutes in the past week. He has 16 or more minutes in each of his past three games, and he is averaging 6.3 points and 3.4 rebounds. It isn't a huge performance, but he has shown he can be an asset in deeper fantasy leagues.

             Walker has been a popular name in the rumor mill with the Hornets sitting in 11th place in the East with a 16-24 record, and that makes sense because he's an All-Star player that has one of the best contracts in the NBA with $12 million owed to him in 2018-19. ""He does everything,"" assistant coach Stephen Silas said. ""He comes up with big steals. He goes for charges. He makes every big pick-and-roll play, every shot, every play for everybody else."" The Hornets haven't give up hope for a spot in the playoffs, but if they don't  turn their season around quickly they will have a very tough decision to make.

             Green has been a bright spot in an otherwise dreary week for the Cavaliers, as he is averaging 16.0 points per contest during the current three-game losing skid. He is shooting 53.1 percent (17-of-32) while going a perfect 9-of-9 from the charity stripe over the past two outings. He remains rather useful in deeper fantasy formats, and right now he isn't a bad low-end DFS play while running relatively hot.

             Angry LeBron is usually never a good thing for the opponent, and he was fuming after the team was whipped in Toronto by 32 points. While he had a huge performance flirting with a triple-double, the rest of the team shot rather poorly and they lost down the stretch after holding a lead late. Next up is a showdown with the defending champion Warriors on Monday.

             The Cavs are in a bit of a funk, but Love played well in this one. He was 8-of-14 from the field and a perfect 4-of-4 from the line while leading the team with a plus-9 rating. It was a much-needed good performance after he entered the game shooting just 12-of-43 (27.9 percent) from the floor over his past four outings. He'll look to continue the good work on MLK Day against the visiting Warriors.

             He briefly went to the locker room, but the Jazz diagnosed him with a ""mild left ankle sprain"" and he seemed fine the rest of the evening. Hood hit 4-of-13 shots in the loss and can't seem to snap out of his slump, as he's now averaging 10.6 points, 3.4 rebounds, 2.2 assists, 0.6 steals and 1.4 triples on 33.9% shooting over his last five games. If there's a hot free agent available, we wouldn't blame you for moving on.

             Dwight Howard and the Hornets have allowed the second fewest fantasy points to centers this season, so the matchup didn't do him any favors. Rudy Gobert (knee) is scheduled to be re-evaluated later this weekend and the Jazz have been linked to Chicago's Nikola Mirotic, so Favors' rest-of-season outlook is a little bleak unless he is a part of any deal.

             He was the only starter who scored in double digits as the Jazz dropped to 3-10 since Rudy Gobert went down with his latest knee injury. As phenomenal as Mitchell was, he ran out of steam late in the game and missed his final four shots with four turnovers in the final five minutes, but we're not about to complain and neither will his fantasy owners. This was his fourth game of the season with 30+ points and he's giving Ben Simmons a run for his money for the ROY award.

            Will Barton will start in place of Gary Harris (personal) on Friday vs. the Grizzlies.
        
        
             Harris is tending to a ""private family matter,"" but coach Malone is hopeful to have him back on Saturday vs. the Spurs. Barton has been in a slump lately and is hitting 35.9% from the field over his last five games, so maybe the move to the first unit will get him going again.

             The Warriors account Tweeted out that Quinn Cook would start, but several beat writers confirmed that it's McCaw getting the nod. Stephen Curry (ankle) is expected back on Saturday, so there's no real reason to pick up McCaw unless you want to stream him tonight.

Harris isn't a very attractive target while working with the second unit, and Nik Stauskas figures to lose some minutes with Carroll back in action.

He's not a must-play guy in his first game back from the long layoff, but he is must-own now that he's finally back out there. Michael Beasley's minutes will likely take a hit once Hardway Jr. is fully up to speed, and Courtney Lee's usage will dip. He'll come off the bench tonight, but Lance Thomas' days as a starter are numbered.

             No surprise here, as Derrick Favors (knee) is back in action tonight. Udoh was impressive in a fill-in start on Wednesday with 16 points (7-of-10 FGs, 2-of-2 FTs), nine rebounds, three steals, two assists and two blocks in 34 minutes, but he'll be hard to trust outside of very deep leagues while Favors is active. Rudy Gobert (knee) is nearing a return as well.

             With both these guys in the starting five, the corresponding move will likely be Jonas Jerebko and Ekpe Udoh returning to the bench, and both those guys will lose a lot of value with the demotion to the second unit. Sefolosha has played well as a starter this season with averages of 10.6 points, 8.0 boards, 1.2 assists and 3.0 steals per contest, so he could be someone to think about as a streamer in deep leagues.

Smith and Kyle Korver. For what it's worth, head coach Tyronn Lue said he talked to LeBron James, and he's feeling good, so King James will not be taking the night off on this back-to-back.

Owners can expect another update following Saturday morning's shootaround, but if he's not able to give it a go, Montrezl Harrell would likely have the opportunity to enter the starting five and he'd make for an intriguing DFS option. Stay tuned.

He's played well in Phoenix this season with averages of 9.1 points, 4.5 assists, 1.1 triples, 1.0 steal and just 1.3 turnovers per game on 41.4% shooting, so he could be someone to think about grabbing in deep leagues.

             According to Warriors beat reporter Anthony Slater, Curry ""looked fine"" at practice on Thursday and there is a ""solid chance"" he returns on Saturday. The Warriors are being understandably cautious by keeping Curry out of both ends of a back-to-back. Shaun Livingston is expected to draw another start at point guard on Friday, with Patrick McCaw again seeing an uptick in minutes off the bench.RotoGrinders.com Daily Slant: With Curry and other inactive Warriors off the floor this year, Kevin Durant owns a 35.0% usage rate (+3.1%) and a 1.49 FPPM rate (+0.10). He’s quickly ascended to one of the top overall plays on the board. Draymond Green also gets a value uptick and is playable in all DFS formats.

             Turner played well on Wednesday, scoring 18 points in 32 minutes in the Blazers loss to the Rockets. If Turner is unable to play on Friday, Moe Harkless and Pat Connaughton would log additional minutes on the wing. Portland might also choose to occasionally use the three-guard lineup coach Terry Stotts experimented with earlier this season, which would mean increased playing time for Shabazz Napier off the bench.

            The Cavs would be willing to trade Tristan Thompson in the ""right deal,"" according to Shams Charania of Yahoo Sports.
        
        
             According to the published report, ""multiple NBA teams have cited Thompson as an asset Cleveland is willing to move in the right deal, such as one for the Los Angeles Clippers’ DeAndre Jordan."" Thompson is averaging career-lows across the board this season, including points, rebounds and minutes. A trade out of Cleveland would almost assuredly increase his fantasy value.

However, with Tim Hardaway Jr. returning to the lineup as soon as this weekend, Beasley is expected to see his playing time drop, according to coach Jeff Hornaeck. ""There were nights when Lance [Thomas] didn’t play. There were nights Mike didn’t play. So we’ll probably end up going back to that,"" said Hornacek.

Nance is worth owning, but he's not going to be all that reliable on nights when Randle, who failed to score in this one, and Kuzma are doing work.

             Ingram is finally feeling it and is shooting it much better of late. He's scored at least 20 points in three of his last four games and is averaging 20.8 points, 5.8 boards, 4.3 assists and 1.8 3-pointers over that stretch. And the best news is that his shots are falling, as he's hit 33-of-55 in those four games, good for 60 percent. He appears to be primed for a big second half for the Lakers after a rough start to the season and his confidence is growing by the day. But poor free throw shooting and a lack of peripheral stats will likely keep him from becoming an elite fantasy player any time soon.

            Julius Randle played just 18 minutes and missed all six of his shots, failing to score for the first time this season in Thursday's win over the Spurs.
        
        
             He picked up three fouls in the first half and saw his minutes limited, while Larry Nance had one of his better games of the season. It was a bad combination for Randle, who was coming off a big game on Tuesday when he had 22 points, 14 rebounds, six assists, a steal and a 3-pointer. Randle had been rolling, but it just wasn't his night. Don't drop him, but do look for him to bounce back against the Mavericks on Saturday.

             Owning Spurs in fantasy hoops is not fun and Manu is no longer someone who should be rostered in standard leagues. And tonight's 93-81 loss to the Baby Lakers marked the first time the Spurs have lost to them at home since 2013 (eight games).

             Forbes has quietly scored in double figures in five straight games, and while he's averaging 14.2 points, 1.2 steals and 1.8 3-pointers over that stretch, he isn't getting assists or rebounds. He's also not guaranteed to play much once Green and Leonard are back, making him very tough to trust. He should only be targeted in deeper leagues, and the fact he plays for the Spurs means he's going to be a mystery man on most nights. He's not worth the risk in 12-team leagues.

             Tony Parker, Kawhi Leonard and Danny Green were all out tonight and the Spurs threw the towel in midway through the fourth quarter. Murray's been bad, failing to score more than eight points in his previous eight games, so it was impossible to see this one coming. And since Parker (ankle) will probably be back in the next one, there's no reason to get excited about Murray

             Harrell's arrow was pointing down with the return of Blake Griffin tonight, but DeAndre Jordan went down with a sprained ankle and didn't return. Harrell should keep rolling if Jordan's going to miss time, and had 14 points and seven boards in his previous game. If you own him, just hang onto him until we find out how long Jordan will be sidelined for the Clippers. And for the record, Harrell actually played very well in the first half when Jordan was healthy, and then really turned it on in the second half. Just beware of his free throw shooting if you're thinking about grabbing him. He's hit just four of his last 14 shots from the line.

             Wallace has been making some nice noise with Milos Teodosic and Austin Rivers out, and had a huge steal and slam tonight to seal the win for the Clippers. And while Teodosic was back tonight, the Clippers started a small lineup that included Milos, Wallace and Lou Williams. Wallace is averaging 15.4 points, 4.0 rebounds, 2.8 assists, 1.6 steals, 0.8 blocks and a 3-pointer in 33 minutes a night over his last five games. He's at least worth a look in all leagues until Rivers is back from his Achilles injury, but the clock is ticking on him as the Clippers get healthy.

             Williams has now scored at least 30 points in three straight games for the first time in his career and is averaging 32.6 points, 6.0 assists and 4.6 3-pointers over his last five games after going for 50 against the Warriors on Wednesday night. Milos Teodosic and Blake Griffin were both back in action tonight, but they didn't slow Williams' roll, despite Milos getting 26 minutes and Griffin getting 33.

             Teodosic has been tough to own this season between the foot problems, poor shooting and lack of big numbers, but the upside and potential are real. He could have a big second half for the Clippers, who are still without Patrick Beverley and Austin Rivers, but the only thing that's guaranteed with him is some 3-pointers and assists. He's a luxury own right now, if you have room to let him grow on your bench, especially with Lou Williams playing so well for the Clippers.

But for now, Hield's nothing more than a borderline hold, at best.

The Kings need scorers and Bogdanovic is emerging as one of their best ones. He's averaging 15.8 points, 3.0 boards, 4.2 assists and 1.4 3-pointers on 55 percent shooting over his last five, and it's time to give him a look in all leagues.

             Hill missed a couple big free throws and didn't shoot it well (1-of-6 from downtown), but played well, especially in the second half when he scored 15 points. He might have been dropped in your league while he was at home, and while De'Aaron Fox is coming on, Hill is still going to play a lot of minutes beside the rookie. He's only played well in spurts this season, so he's not a must-own player, but if you need a point guard, Hill is worth a look if available, especially with Frank Mason (heel) out for several weeks.

            DeAndre Jordan will not play in the second half of Thursday's game due to a left ankle sprain. He tried to warm up and play, but was ruled out just before the start of the third quarter.
        
        
             When the Clippers broadcast cut to a commercial break before the third quarter started, they showed Jordan warming up and indicated that he would play. However, the ankle is obviously not well enough for him to go, so he'll focus on getting treatment with hopes of playing on Saturday against the Kings. He's yet to miss a game this season and is an iron man, so it's possible he'll be able to go on Saturday, but owners will want to watch the newsfeed over the next two days to see how he's progressing. Montrezl Harrell is playing well and Willie Reed will also see a boost for as long as Jordan is out.

             As much as we love Poeltl's upside, this game was a 34-point blowout, Serge Ibaka (suspension) wasn't playing and Jonas Valanciunas was in some foul trouble. Poeltl isn't always the backup center when Toronto is healthy because the Raptors will play Ibaka and Lucas Nogueira at the five, so he's tough to trust on a nightly basis.

            DeAndre Jordan came down on someone's foot and appeared to badly twist his left ankle in the second quarter on Thursday, causing him to go to the locker room.
        
        
             The good news is he walked off under his own power and was examined on the bench for a spell before retreating to the locker room. The bad news is that it didn't look great in replays and Jordan hasn't missed a game this season. He's likely getting X-rays and we'll let you know the diagnosis, but in the meantime, Montrezl Harrell and Willie Reed would get a boost if he's out. If Jordan's done for the night, he'll finish with eight points, seven rebounds and two assists on 4-of-4 shooting.

             He played 19 or less minutes for the seventh straight game, but probably would've played a little more if this game was closer. Miles has some value as a 3-point specialist, but he's not playing much these days because OG Anunoby's defense has been a key to Toronto's success. There should be better options on your wire such as a guy like Wayne Ellington.

             He didn't get the start, but Siakam took advantage of some extra playing time with Serge Ibaka (suspension) out and cleaned up in garbage time. He does have averages of 14.3 points, 4.0 rebounds, 2.3 assists, 1.0 blocks, 1.3 steals and 0.8 triples in four fill-in starts this season, so keep that in mind if Ibaka ever needs to miss time again.

             Sure he's not playing much, but Valanciunas has been a per-minute monster lately. He was well on his way to an even bigger night with Serge Ibaka (suspension) out, but the game was over by the end of the third quarter and J-Val also had some foul trouble. Despite playing 20.2 minutes over his last five games, J-Val is still rolling with averages of 12.8 points, 10.2 rebounds and 1.0 blocks in that span.

            Delon Wright was quiet against the Cavaliers on Thursday, scoring six points with four assists, two rebounds and two blocks in 18 minutes.
        
        
             Wright was a popular streamer and DFS play after scoring 13 points with seven rebounds, four assists, one steal, one block and one triple in his last start, but Fred VanVleet was on fire tonight with 22 points and six triples. This game also got out of hand by the third quarter and the Raptors ended up winning by 34 points, so Wright didn't see the floor much. Wright's owners should give him another chance, especially if Kyle Lowry (back) can't go on Saturday vs. the Warriors.

            Fred VanVleet went off for a career-high 22 points (8-of-11 FGs) in Thursday's 133-99 win over the Cavaliers.
        
        
             Kyle Lowry (back) missed his second game in a row, but VanVleet was much more effective this time around than he was on Tuesday, hitting six triples with four rebounds, four assists and one steal in 24 minutes compared to six points and four assists in 18 minutes for Delon Wright. Wright had the better fantasy line in the previous game, and it looks like the Raptors may go with a hot hand approach if Lowry continues to miss time. For now, Wright is still the better fantasy asset to own, but this position battle will be fun to watch.

             The Cavaliers were blown out for the second game in a row, so Love took an early seat along with Isaiah Thomas and LeBron James. Love is in a really bad slump right now, and if you take away his 27-point effort against Orlando he would have averages of 5.0 points on 4-of-26 shooting in his last three games. He'll bounce back and gets a great matchup on Friday vs. the Pacers to do so.

             He's not cleared for back-to-back sets and we haven't heard when the Cavs will lift those restrictions. Thomas has looked rusty for the most part since his return and Toronto exposed him on defense tonight despite missing Kyle Lowry. It's just a matter of time before Thomas returns to All-NBA form, so his fantasy owners should sit tight for now. He added three assists, two rebounds and one block in 25 minutes.

             The Cavaliers were trailing by 28 points at the end of the third quarter, so LeBron took an early seat. The Cavaliers have now lost seven out of their last 10 games and James' frustration was easy to see, as he lashed out at his teammates during a timeout. Cleveland even had a film session on Wednesday to go over their defensive woes, yet they still gave up 127+ points for the third straight game. LeBron will look to get his team back on track against the Pacers on Friday.

Wallace is worth a look as a streaming option tonight and is trending up in deeper formats. Jawun Evans and Wes Johnson will head to the bench and C.J.

             ""I could have played tonight,"" Parker said. ""But you know the Spurs, they are going to just be cautious. So the bad luck I had wasn't too bad."" Parker is expected to have restrictions for about another month and will be rested a ton down the stretch, so most fantasy owners should just leave him on the wire. Dejounte Murray will start at PG on Thursday vs. the Lakers along with Bryn Forbes, Kyle Anderson, LaMarcus Aldridge and Pau Gasol. The Spurs will list Parker as questionable.

             He will surely have restrictions and the Clippers may monitor his minutes for the foreseeable future because they don't want to risk another re-aggravation. He's worth picking up if you're targeting assists and triples, but he doesn't bring a lot to the table in other categories. Lou Williams loses some ball-handling responsibility with Teodosic back and Jawun Evans loses some value as well.

The Clippers played Blake for 32 minutes on Dec. 29 when he returned from a month-long absence (knee injury), so he may not have restrictions tonight. We'll let you know how he looks after the game, but with Griffin back that means Sam Dekker and Montrezl Harrell will lose most of their value.

Calderon doesn't have much appeal even as a streaming option, though, so there are no clear winners here.

It's reasonable to think he could return in mid- to late-January, therefore, and the next step is likely for him to start taking contact.

Delon Wright should earn another start with Fred VanVleet picking up minutes with the second unit.RotoGrinders.com Daily Slant: DeMar DeRozan leads the Raptors in usage at a massive 44.5% to go along with an elite 1.61 FPPM with Lowry/Ibaka off the floor. Jonas Valanciunas has logged only 20.3 minutes in that split, but he's averaging a healthy 1.10 FPPM with Delon Wright checking in at 0.91 and Fred VanVleet checking in at 0.87. DeRozan is an elite target in all formats while Wright is the preferred value target between he and VanVleet.

             Waiters opted not to have surgery last season, but after getting multiple second opinions this week, he reportedly decided he couldn't wait any longer. Waiters' expected absence for the rest of the season is a major blow for Miami's depth. Tyler Johnson, Josh Richardson and Wayne Ellington will continue to take on heavier workloads, with Johnson and Richardson in particular having the ball in their hands more often. Fantasy owners may want to wait for more confirmation before cutting Waiters, but not if there's a hot FA you might miss out on. We should have a rough timetable for Waiters' recovery soon after the surgery is performed.

            J.J. Redick caught fire early in Thursday's game, finishing 7-of-12 from the field with five 3-pointers for 22 points, seven rebounds, three assists and a rare block in 30 minutes.
        
        
             Redick poured in 18 points in the first half before cooling down, but you won't hear fantasy owners complaining. He's now scored 20+ points in four consecutive games, which ties the longest such streak of his 12-year career. Needless to say, he's found a nice groove at the halfway point of his first season with Philly.

            Robert Covington had another quiet game on Thursday, shooting 2-of-8 from the field with one 3-pointer for five points, three rebounds and one assist.
        
        
             Covington also committed four turnovers in 30 minutes today, and over the past eight games he's averaging a modest 8.3 points (40.4% FGs, 81.8% FTs), 1.4 threes, 4.8 rebounds, 2.0 assists, 1.4 steals and 0.1 blocks. His usage rate is just 13.5% in that span, compared to 17.9% on the season, and we're hopeful he'll be more involved when Philly returns to action vs. Toronto on Monday. This is a good time to make some buy-low offers.

             Embiid wanted to put on a show for the fans in London's O2 Arena on Thursday. Earlier this week he told reporters that he was ""really excited to play NBA in London and cannot wait to kick [Boston's] ass."" That didn't exactly go as planned, with Philly blowing a 22-point lead before eventually losing by double-digits. The loss dropped the Sixers to 19-20 on the season, just 1.5 games ahead of the No. 9 seed Knicks.

            The Sixers' four-game win streak was snapped on Thursday, despite T.J. McConnell coming off the bench for 12 points on 6-of-11 shooting, five assists, four rebounds and three steals.
        
        
             McConnell played 26 minutes today and he continues to be a sneaky source of assists and steals, which has kept him afloat as a late-round option in 12-team leagues. He was averaging 4.0 points in Philly's previous three games, though, and hasn't made a 3-pointer since Christmas Day, so there's not much upside while Ben Simmons and J.J. Redick are healthy.

             The win gave Brad Stevens his 200th victory as an NBA coach, and the Celtics are now tied with Golden State for the best record in the league (34-10). Afterward, Stevens had nothing but praise for Theis, saying, ""He has been terrific. He has come in, played his role … He never changes. That’s a real good quality."" His real-world value far exceeds his fantasy appeal, though, and he belongs on the wire in nearly all leagues.

             It was a tale of two halfs for the Celtics, who trailed by as many as 22 points in the first half before pulling away for a 114-103 victory. Morris was a steadying force early in the game and he moved well throughout, so maybe his nagging left knee injury is finally behind him. He added three 3-pointers in just 24 minutes tonight, but has been too inconsistent to trust in typical leagues.

             Brown's efforts helped the Celtics earn the victory in London, beating the Sixers 114-103. Boston was stuck in mud early tonight but Brown and Daniel Theis (six points, seven boards) made some energy plays to get their team going and they cruised in the second half. Brown is a terrific player to own if you're punting FT% with players like Dwight Howard or Ben Simmons -- tossing out his 56.5% FTs on 3.4 attempts, he emerges as a solid mid-round value.

             Horford missed Saturday's game with soreness, but that absence was precautionary and gave him five full days to rest, due to Boston's trip to London. He hit 5-of-10 FGs and 2-of-2 FTs tonight, with one 3-pointer, one block and only one turnover, and looked completely fine in 35 minutes of action. He'll get another long break, too, before facing the Pelicans on Tuesday.

The Grizzlies are also tied for the worst record in the Western Conference, and they could be sellers at the trade deadline, so there are a lot of moving pieces here. At least he continues to ramp up his activity in practices.

We've yet to hear about him taking contact, though, so his return date is still anyone's guess. With strict restrictions even when he's relatively healthy, there's no incentive to hold Parsons in re-draft leagues.

             This is the first we've heard about a hip injury for the Suns No. 4 pick, but it sounds like he'll be joining Marquese Chriss (hip) on the sidelines. Dragan Bender is already listed as a starter at PF, and if Jackson is out we're likely to see more of Jared Dudley, with T.J. Warren getting as many minutes as he can handle.

             Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry said on Wednesday that there was a ""good chance"" Davis would be ready to go vs. Portland. We'll assume he's a bit closer to 'probable', therefore, but should know more after Friday's shootaround. If he is ultimately ruled out, expect Dante Cunningham to earn another start with DeMarcus Cousins being even more of a focal point offensively.

Friday is the first half of a back-to-back set, though, so maybe he's targeting a return on Saturday. After that, the Nets return home for three straight home games, beginning Monday vs. the Knicks.

Shabazz Napier will benefit if Dame is at all limited, but for now we're expecting him to be fine. Check back after Portland's shootaround on Friday for confirmation.

             The Rockets are going to be thin up front on Friday with Nene resting his knee and Tarik Black dealing with a corneal abrasion in his right eye. Expect Clint Capela to play heavy minutes with Ryan Anderson spending some time at center.

Again, I think we’re about a month away from having him back."" Parker has already been cleared for full-contact 5-on-5, but the Bucks are being cautious and want to make sure he's in top shape before activating him. Based on this timetable, we should see him the week before the All-Star break.

So, there’s so many boxes still to check. It’s great that he’s making good strides, but the timelines and those things don’t change."" The Celtics aren't giving him an official timetable and he's considered doubtful to return during the regular season, but both the team and Hayward have said that they are hopeful that he could be back for playoffs.

             ""They just gave me some pills to try and relax it, try and relax the muscles that kind of tighten up,"" Johnson said. ""I still can’t really turn my head. It’s still hard to turn my head. But we got it to somewhere where it was manageable, the pain, the movement and being able to at least lift my shoulder up, which to me was the most important part."" Johnson wasn't supposed to play on Wednesday, but ended up playing 31 minutes after Udonis Haslem convinced him to fight through it. The Heat are off until Sunday's game vs. the Bucks, so hopefully the time off will help.

""Forget positions, forget roles, make a team play you. Bam, he’s done that in a lot of different roles so far in his young career."" The Heat have been experimenting with Adebayo next to Hassan Whiteside and it's gone really well, as Adebayo is averaging 15.5 points, 8.5 rebounds, 4.0 assists and 2.5 blocks in his last two games. He's worth picking up to see if he can keep it going, but he'll take a hit with James Johnson back for their next game.

""He did not [talk to me],’’ Kanter said of coach Jeff Hornacek. ""I’m ready [to play in the fourth]. It’s a little weird to me too. I guess he’s trying to make everybody happy. That’s what he’s doing. The most important thing is if we’re winning or not. If we’re winning we’re good. If we’re losing, there’s a problem."" The Knicks have been using Kyle O'Quinn for his defense and Michael Beasley is also spending more time next to Kristaps Porzingis these days, but Kanter is still a nightly double-double threat despite seeing a small dip in minutes.

             Despite opening the season as the starting point guard, Sessions has fallen behind both Jarrett Jack and Frank Ntilikina. He's played in just five games since the beginning of December, so there aren't any fantasy implications here. If he is waived, the veteran should be able to find another home as a second- or third-string PG.

Both sides are still evaluating their positions and Shams Charania of The Vertical said no deal is imminent, but it makes a lot of sense for the Clippers to extend him if they don't think they can get good value in return at the deadline in the form of drafts picks or young talent.

Lou Williams might also be forced into heavier action after a monster 50-point game, and the Clippers can only hope that Milos Teodosic (foot) is cleared to play vs. the Kings.

             Kevin Durant (calf) was back in action tonight, but Golden State was without Klay Thompson (rest) and Stephen Curry (ankle). Nick Young also didn't fare well as a fill-in starter at SG, and Shaun Livingston is on a perpetual minute-limit, which left plenty of time for Iguodala and Patrick McCaw (four points, three rebounds, two assists in 25 minutes). If you're using Iguodala in a deep league, just be mindful that he could rest during back-to-back games on Friday and Saturday.

            Draymond Green (right knee soreness) had seven points, 10 rebounds and four assists in 29 minutes vs. the Clippers on Wednesday.
        
        
             He went 5-of-6 from the FT line tonight, but shot 1-of-9 from the field while missing all six of his 3-point attempts. This is the sixth time all season he's been held without any defensive stats, so that's nothing to worry about. Despite being a constant presence on Golden State's injury report, Dray hasn't missed a game since Dec. 20.

            Kevin Durant (right calf strain) returned from a two-game absence on Wednesday with 40 points on pristine 14-of-18 shooting, making 6-of-7 threes with four boards and four assists.
        
        
             Durant added one steal, one block and a 6-of-8 mark at the free-throw line, and he did his damage in just 31 minutes tonight -- in the process, he became the 44th player in NBA history to score at least 20,000 points. The Warriors fell apart when he was off the court, though, and they gave up 125 points to the severely depleted Clippers tonight, which led to Durant being rested for the final 3:03 as the score got out of hand. All signs point to KD being ready for Friday's game vs. the Bucks, but owners should double-check his status since it's the first game of a back-to-back set.

             Stephen Curry (ankle) was out tonight, but he and coach Steve Kerr both downplayed the injury before the game. Golden State declined to give Steph any imaging tests, so they really must not be concerned -- he said they're just playing it safe because he's hurt his right ankle in the past. That leaves Livingston with temporary value, at best, and he doesn't have much upside even when starting.

             Klay Thompson was resting tonight and the coach Steve Kerr opted for Swaggy's shooting with the starters, while Patrick McCaw logged 25 minutes off the bench. The Warriors were shredded defensively, both in the paint (60 points allowed) and beyond the arc (33 points), and it's safe to assume coach Steve Kerr can't wait to get Klay back in the starting five on Friday. Young belongs on the waiver wire.

             The steals were the only saving grace for Wes tonight, but that's not nearly enough to satisfy owners who streamed him as a starter in a fast-paced game. Blake Griffin (concussion) was among the long list of injured Clippers tonight, and C.J. Williams (ankle) exited early, and if Johnson can't produce in these conditions it's very hard to trust him in standard leagues.

             Wallace made his only 3-point attempt and didn't turn the ball over tonight, rounding out an exceptional performance. This will be completely overshadowed by Lou Williams' 50-point eruption, but Wallace is quietly making a case for fantasy ownership over the past five games with averages of 17.0 points, 0.8 triples, 4.4 rebounds, 2.8 assists, 1.6 steals and 1.7 blocks. We'll see if he can keep it up with Milos Teodosic (foot) possibly returning as soon as Thursday vs. the Kings.

             Blake Griffin is still in the league's concussion protocol but he could be cleared in time for Thursday's game vs. Sacramento.

             Williams scored 27 of his points in a scintillating third-quarter performance, the highest total in any quarter during his 13-year NBA career. Golden State simply had no answers defensively with Stephen Curry (ankle) and Klay Thompson (rest) both unavailable. Sweet Lou has surged into top-20 value over the past few weeks and he's inside the top-50 on the season. You're unlikely to get that type of value back in a trade, so it's hard to even call him 'sell-high' at this point. That said, his monster usage should dip once Blake Griffin (concussion) and Milos Teodosic (foot) return to action -- Doc Rivers has repeatedly said he doesn't want to tire out Williams, but basically couldn't take him off the court tonight.

He took advantage of a short-handed Pelicans team tonight, which was playing without Anthony Davis (ankle), so we're still skeptical of him, but it can't hurt to grab him in deeper leagues in case his upswing proves to be sustainable.

            Dante Cunningham started on Wednesday in place of Anthony Davis (ankle), posting nine points, five rebounds, one 3-pointer and one steal in a tough loss at Memphis.
        
        
             Cunningham played 18 minutes but as usual he had low usage and did little to satisfy owners, even in deep leagues. The Pelicans are optimistic that AD will be ready to go for Friday's game, too, so there's no incentive to grab Cunningham tonight.

             Anthony Davis (sprained right ankle) was out tonight, so predictably Cousins was very busy despite being the focal point of the Memphis defense. He committed five turnovers tonight but that's nothing new, as his 5.0 miscues per game lead the NBA by a wide margin (Russell Westbrook is second at 4.5). Cousins hasn't missed a game this season, of course, so it's all good for his fantasy owners

             He's scorching over the past four games, averaging 24.8 points, 3.5 triples, 6.5 assists, 4.3 rebounds and 1.0 steals. His numbers are way higher as a starter this season, for obvious reasons, but it sounds like James Harden (hamstring) could be back relatively soon -- Gordon's owners should enjoy the inflated production while it lasts.

             Anderson is shooting 36.9% from deep this season, but that plummeted to just 31.1% in December. ""My looks have been kind of sporadic, but that's the way the game goes,"" he said. ""I just gotta be aggressive."" The shots will start falling again eventually, but Anderson's role leaves him as little more than a 3-point specialist with a handful of rebounds. He should get a ton of minutes on Friday, however, since both Tarik Black (eye) and Nene (knee) have already been ruled out vs. the Suns.

             Green came in averaging 17.3 points, 3.0 rebounds, 0.7 steals and a whopping 4.1 triples per game for Houston, while hitting 51.3% FGs and 90.9% FTs. Even so, he said he's still getting up to speed. ""My conditioning is picking up pretty quick,"" he said. ""I give myself another week or two, I think I should be right there."" Tonight's supporting stats were a nice twist, and he's a staple of fantasy lineups at least until James Harden is healthy -- and maybe beyond.

             Dedmon's been back for two games after missing extended time with a leg injury and was playing very well before the injury. But he now has to deal with guys like Miles Plumlee, John Collins and Mike Muscala, meaning it could be tough for him to get back into the groove he was in before the injury. The Hawks have too many big men in their pocket right now, and Collins is the guy we'd prefer stashing. Just keep an eye on Dedmon in case he starts getting more than 20 minutes a night.

             Turner seems to have locked down the starting SF job, but the usual asterisks apply -- he's inconsistent and a poor source of supporting stats. You don't have to look far for examples, as he was averaging 8.3 points, 1.7 rebounds, 1.7 assists and 0.3 steals over his previous three games. He's just a fringe option in most formats.

             Nurk did have eight rebounds, three blocks and one assist, so it wasn't a total loss. Part of his low minutes were due to early foul trouble, but he also took a backseat with Ed Davis (11 points, 10 boards) playing well off the bench tonight. Nurk's shooting was trending up prior to this rough night, which included a handful of easy misses near the rim. The Pelicans' interior defense is suspect most nights, so we're anticipating a bounce-back effort on Friday.

             Damian Lillard (strained right calf) was back in action tonight, which bumped Napier to the second unit and eroded his minutes. He was terrific filling in as the starting PG, though, and may have secured an 18-24 minute role from coach Terry Stotts. Napier is also a great handcuff for Lillard, even though Dame has been extremely durable throughout his career. Barring a pessimistic update about Napier's ankle, we'll leave him off the injury report.

            John Collins played just 17 minutes and hit 3-of-4 shots and 2-of-2 free throws for eight points, two rebounds, two assists and a block in Wednesday's win over the Nuggets.
        
        
             He had five fouls, which hurt him, while Mike Muscala and Dewayne Dedmon are also back for the Hawks. The Hawks aren't very good at tanking, as they probably should not have been trying to win this game. Collins would have played more minutes had he not been in foul trouble and you still have to think the 11-win Hawks are going to eventually turn him loose this season. The Hawks are in the trade market, don't need to win games, and Collins is a key piece to the future. Be patient with him if you can, and only drop him if you're getting a sure thing off your waiver wire. He should eventually explode at some point in the second half.

             Lillard was on an unspecified minute-limit tonight, as the Blazers seek to avoid any setbacks after their star PG missed seven of the past nine games. He still played 32 minutes, however, and returned the type of all-around, efficient line that owners love. His calf injury didn't appear to limit him at all, so fire him up for games on Friday (at New Orleans) and Sunday (at Minnesota).

             Butler was a solid 7-of-13 from the floor and 11-of-12 from the free-throw line.

He is averaging 22.7 points, 8.3 assists, 7.3 rebounds and 2.7 steals per game over his past three outings, as he is putting up top-10 fantasy numbers in 9-category formats.

             He hit 8-of-16 shots and four 3-pointers on Monday and appears to be out of his shooting funk. He hit just 8-of-32 shots over his previous three games and his scoring was down, along with most of his other numbers, but he has been awesome in his last two, averaging 18 points, 4.5 rebounds, 3.0 assists, 1.0 steals, 1.5 blocks and 4.0 3-pointers on 48 percent shooting. It's only a two-game sample size, but Prince is back.

             Teague's minutes were rather limited because of the lopsided nature of the score in the second half, not by any kind of a setback. He also chipped in with a 3-pointer, four rebounds, three assists, two steals and a blocked shot. Despite the shaky outing it appears safe to plug him back into the active fantasy lineup in all seasonal leagues. DFS players might want to see him do a little more before trusting him again, however.

             This was Lyles' lowest scoring game since before Christmas and he's absolutely been crushing it for his new fantasy owners. And while tonight's line wasn't ideal, the minutes were good and he had every opportunity for a big night, just like teammate Nikola Jokic. Lyles will obviously take a big hit once Paul Millsap is back from his wrist injury, but until that happens, he looks like a must-start fantasy player. Look for him to bounce back on Friday against the Grizzlies.

             The Timberwolves cruised to their third consecutive easy win, as all three victories have come by at least 16 points. Despite the lopsided scores on the board in the second half, KAT has logged at least 30 minutes in each outing thanks to head coach Tom Thibodeau. Fantasy owners love Thibodeau, as most others NBA head coaches would have their players resting for longer stretches while limiting their fantasy production.

He can't stay this hot forever, but he's shooting 49 percent on the season and appears to be locked and loaded for a big second half. He's also averaging 35 minutes a game right now, so he should have a lot more big nights coming in the near future, especially if his shot keeps falling.

             In addition to simply earning more minutes this season, LeVert is doing more while he's on the court -- his per-36-minute stats have increased in scoring (16.1 points per 36), triples (1.6), assists (5.6), steals (1.8) and blocks (0.5). His turnovers have nearly doubled, however, which is taking a toll on his 9-cat value. Still, he should only see his role increase as the Nets develop young guys over their final 41 games.

             Crabbe came down awkwardly on his left leg vs. the Raptors, which forced him to miss overtime, but it obviously wasn't serious. This is the first time in his career that he's scored 20+ points in consecutive games, according to the Nets PR department, and he's heating up at the midway point of the season. If he was cut by an impatient owner, go get him.

             Oh, what could have been. If Jokic would have hit half his shots (he's a 54 percent career shooter), his scoring number shoots up to about 25 points, and who knows where his head would have been for the rest of the game. But as it stands, he backed up his triple-double on Monday with a full stat line, and the only thing missing was his shot falling. This was his second highest shot total of the season and the arrow is pointing straight up for Jokic. Hopefully he stays as active and sees more shots fall against the Grizzlies on Friday.

             Gibson hit 4-of-5 from the field, but his playing time was rather limited due to foul trouble. In fact, he ended up fouling out, giving Gorgui Dieng and Nemanja Bjelica a little more time. He'll look to avoid the referee's whistle and build on his solid shooting night on Friday evening against the visiting Knicks.

            Terrance Ferguson made another start Wednesday at Minnesota, but he was limited to just three points across 23 minutes.
        
        
             Ferguson's night was a disaster, as he hit just 1-of-7 from the field, including 1-of-6 from behind the arc, and he grabbed just one board with one assist and one steal. Hey, the good news is that he didn't turn it over once. However, Andre Roberson (knee) cannot get back soon enough. For now, Ferguson might be a decent low-priced contrarian play in DFS, but he has no fantasy appeal in standard formats.

             Dinwiddie earned praise from former coach Stan Van Gundy before the game, with SVG saying, ""He’s playing very well. It passes the eye test, too, and not just numbers."" Maybe he psyched out Dinwiddie, who finished with his lowest scoring total since the Nets' season opener. He was soaring in his previous three games with 25.7 points, 6.7 assists, 2.7 triples and 1.3 steals, so we're expecting a major bounce-back effort vs. Atlanta's defense on Friday.

             Adams certainly had his hands full with Karl-Anthony Towns, Gorgui Dieng, Taj Gibson, etc. down low. He was able to extend his streak of games with five or more rebounds to 21, but his string of five straight outings with 10 or more points came to a conclusion. He might have another rough night on the offensive side when he squares off against Dwight Howard and the Hornets on the road Saturday night.

             Drummond did whatever he wanted vs. starting Tyler Zeller and backups Jarrett Allen and Jahlil Okafor tonight, but that's not a big surprise. The Nets are giving up the third-most rebounds to opposing frontcourts (only the Kings and Lakers yield more), and this was a perfect matchup for Drummond. He hit 9-of-15 FGs and 4-of-6 FTs, and should also fare well vs. Robin Lopez and the Bulls on Saturday.

Those two will continue swapping starts depending upon the matchup, which makes it hard to trust either one in standard fantasy leagues. The return of Stanley Johnson (hip) tonight is just one more reason to avoid Bullock.

             Johnson came off the bench behind starter Reggie Bullock, who had already claimed the job prior to Johnson getting hurt.

             Westbrook was pretty careful with his shot and the ball in this one, hitting 15-of-23 from the field while turning it over just four times. Unfortunately for Westbrook the rest of his teammates decided to take the night off. The Thunder are in a nosedive, losing three in a row and five of the past seven, but Westbrook continues to persevere regardless of the win-loss column.

            The Jazz continued their road trip on Wednesday with a 107-104 win in D.C., aided by Donovan Mitchell's 16 points, five rebounds, four assists, one steal and one block.
        
        
             Mitchell shot just 7-of-20 tonight (2-of-10 from deep), but he came up with a huge defensive play to prevent a potentially game-tying 3-pointer from Bradley Beal. That won't go unnoticed by coach Quin Snyder, who pointed to the defensive end as the source of Utah's recent struggles. ""We’ve had a consistency of effort, but the defensive execution, the focus that’s required, is where I see potential progress for us."" Rough shooting aside, this was another positive step for Utah's impressive rookie.

             Rubio hit three 3-pointers with four steals, three assists and two rebounds in 41 minutes. He was coming off an 0-of-6 shooting dud and is at just 39.2% on the season, so owners should enjoy shooting nights like this whenever they occur. After a very rocky start to the season, Rubio is starting to find a rhythm with backcourt partner Donovan Mitchell -- he's still just flirting with top-100 value over the past month, but that's going up after tonight's strong effort.

             The 17-year veteran continues to log solid minutes for Utah, which could be trying to bolster his appeal around the league -- with an expiring $10.5 million contract, he might attract a team in need of a backup scorer. He added four rebounds, four assists and three steals tonight, but all-around games like this are very much the exception.

             Jerebko added four rebounds, one assist and one steal, and he started ahead of Thabo Sefolosha tonight. He was coming off a pair of DNP-CDs and this may have simply been a situational move from coach Quin Snyder -- either way, Jerebko hasn't done nearly enough to be worth adding.

             Before the game, coach Quin Snyder said that Thabo would ""probably"" play tonight -- the Jazz hadn't played since Sunday, so this looks like a lineup decision and not based on Snyder wanting to rest his veteran swingman. Thabo is a steals specialist when getting enough minutes, but his role is far too chaotic to trust.

             Derrick Favors (ankle) was out tonight, and with Rudy Gobert (knee) still on the shelf Utah's frontcourt was razor-thin. Udoh is among the most prolific shot-blockers on a per-minute basis this season (2.7 blocks per 36 minutes), but he doesn't often get the run needed to help fantasy owners. He'd be worth streaming if Favors misses more games or is traded in the coming weeks, so keep an eye on Utah's news page.

             Malcolm Brogdon has supplanted Snell in the starting five and he isn't doing anything to play himself out of the role. As such, Snell's minutes continue to shrink. In fact, his 17 minutes on Wednesday represent a new season low. Still, the situation isn't engraved in stone and the bottom could fall out on Brogdon at any time. Snell isn't a bad guy to scoop up and stash if you have the roster flexibility, as he might be just a bad Brogdon game or two away from returning to the starting lineup.

             Bledsoe isn't throwing up eye-popping stats, but he is posting consistent numbers since arriving with the Bucks. He is posting top-50 fantasy value over the past six weeks. While he isn't needed to do as much heavy lifting at the offensive end as his days in Phoenix, he can still fill up the basket on occasion when the others are having an off night.

             Middleton didn't light the world afire in any one area, but he was pretty strong across the board. He was a solid 9-of-14 from the field, and perhaps the only area fantasy owners have a beef is with his 4-of-6 line from the charity stripe. Middleton is working on a string of 22 consecutive games with at least 12 points, and he has three or more rebounds across each of his past 11 outings. He continues to be a very consistent fantasy option in most formats.

             This was the first time in six games that Lance has made at least half of his shots. The counting stats are good enough to own him in deeper points leagues, but he continues to hurt owners in percentages (43.3% FGs, 67.2% FTs) and turnovers (1.7) without contributing enough 3-pointers or defensive stats to compensate. He's a liability in category-based leagues, at least while Victor Oladipo is healthy.

            Domantas Sabonis (left wrist) finished a start vs. Miami on Wednesday with 18 points on 8-of-15 shooting, seven rebounds and four turnovers in 31 minutes.
        
        
             Myles Turner (elbow) is out at least one more game, which means Sabonis should continue to see a hefty workload. He navigated foul trouble tonight and the only disappointment was a complete lack of supporting stats -- we still like his odds of going off vs. the small-ball Cavs on Friday.

            Giannis Antetokounmpo ended up with 26 points, seven rebounds, an assist and a blocked shot over 34 minutes in Wednesday's victory against the Magic.
        
        
             Antetokounmpo met very little resistance in the middle from the Magic, hitting 10-of-15 from rather close range. He struggled a bit from the charity stripe, hitting just 6-of-10, but fantasy owners complaining about that are just being petty. It was another solid night at the office for The Greek Freak, who recently went No. 1 overall in the Rotoworld Fantasy Hoops Staff Midseason Draft.

             Oladipo continues to establish himself as a cornerstone for the Pacers, and his 24.5 points are on pace to be the third-highest in franchise history. He did commit four turnovers tonight, while going 0-of-6 from downtown in 38 minutes, but those are caveats fantasy owners can happily ignore. He's soaring as a top-20 value in almost any format.

             Collison is averaging a mere 6.6 shot attempts in his previous five games, and it sounds like he's intentionally deferring to teammates. ""When we are moving the ball, it’s easier shots for everyone,"" he said. ""We know [Victor Oladipo] is going to be one of our top scorers, but everyone else is going to chip in with good ball movement."" While not ideal for fantasy purposes, DC can still put up mid-round value with a usage rate in the teens.

             Erik Spoelstra opted to bring Johnson off the bench behind Goran Dragic, Josh Richardson and Derrick Jones Jr. That gave the second unit more offensive firepower, especially without James Johnson (suspension) tonight, so this could be a temporary move. He said afterward that he ""still can't really turn [his] head"" because of a pinched nerve in his neck that was causing pain when he raised his shoulder, but Miami is off until Sunday so he shouldn't be in danger of missing time.

             The Heat are in the midst of a road-heavy stretch, with 10 of 13 games coming away from Miami. ""Now it’s time to show we are good on the road, too,"" Dragic said before the game. ""It’s a lot of games away from home, but I think we are ready for that."" They looked ready tonight despite missing James Johnson (suspension), and will be going for their seventh straight win vs. the Bucks on Sunday.

He is in the midst of his best run of the season, averaging 12.3 points, 9.0 rebounds and 1.7 steals per game over the past three.

Tonight he shot 4-of-9 from the field and 7-of-9 from the line, and it's the second time all season he's logged 30+ minutes in consecutive games. The absence of James Johnson (suspension) was an obvious factor, though, so Bam is just a speculative add if you have a guy you're itching to cut.

He'll have to wait his turn for more playing time, but that chance could come sooner rather than later if the team finds a trading partner for Evan Fournier. Iwundu isn't a bad stash option just in case a transaction is made, bumping up his minutes and fantasy appeal in the process.

             It's the first triple-double for the Knicks since Carmelo Anthony posted one in 2012. Jack was part of the biggest play of the game as he set up Kristaps Porzingis off a cut to get a dunk at the buzzer to send this game to overtime (video in link below). Jack's minutes continue to trend up and perhaps he heard the whispers of coach Jeff Hornacek looking at starting Frank Ntilikina. Jack isn't exactly the sexiest fantasy asset in fantasy leagues, but he's a fine player to own until further notice.

            Dwight Howard notched 15 points, 12 rebounds, four blocks, two assists and one steal in a tough loss to the visiting Mavericks on Wednesday.
        
        
             Dallas allows the fourth most opponent rebounds per game, so Dwight was a lock for a double-double tonight. He hit all five of his field goals, but was an atrocious 5-of-18 from the FT line. That's nothing new for fantasy owners, but it was a huge difference in a game Charlotte lost by four points. Overall, Dwight's fantasy owners have to be thrilled that he's stayed healthy while averaging a strong double-double with defensive stats.

             After the first quarter, he really disappeared in this game with only four points in the second, third and fourth quarters, but Porzingis did show up in overtime with a dunk at the buzzer (video in link below). He was 0-of-4 from the line in this game, but that seems like a fluke after going 17-of-18 in his previous three games. The Unicorn will be a stud as long as he's in the lineup.

             After his birthday on Tuesday, he's a year older and he only needed to miss one game from an ankle injury. Beasley continues to see minutes next to Kristaps Porzingis with that duo handling the most of he forward minutes.

             Augustin was also a dismal 0-of-5 from behind the arc while adding four assists, three rebounds and no other stats. He was unable to carry over the momentum from a solid 18-point performance the previous night against the Mavericks. This is why he is only a recommended fantasy option in the deepest of formats. Augustin is just too inconsistent.

             Jarrett Jack is playing his best basketball of the season, so it may be a little longer before we see Ntilikina take over as the starter. Coach Jeff Hornacek did say he's ""looking at"" starting the rookie, but it's starting to feel it won't be until after the All-Star break. There is upside for steals and dimes, but Ntilikina is more of a stash.

             He did not go to the line today, but that' still a very efficient line. Lee's 96.1 percent from the line puts him on pace to be the second Knick ever to lead the NBA in free throw percentage for a season (Allan Houston), and he continues to yield mid-round value in standard leagues. He's been a major bargain in nine-cat leagues.

            Mario Hezonja was back to the bench Wednesday in Milwaukee, but he responded well with 13 points, four rebounds and two steals across 31 minutes.
        
        
             Aaron Gordon was benched Tuesday for being late for a team flight, so Hezonja slid into the starting five. Hezonja was back to the bench, but he was way more effective than Gordon in this one. He isn't likely to move back into the starting five anytime soon, but he is one of the first options off of the bench. He remains a solid option in deeper fantasy play, and isn't a bad stash option in case Evan Fournier is moved.

             MKG has played between 21-26 minutes in seven straight games. It's possible that the Hornets are reluctant to play him heavy minutes due to his lengthy injury history, but whatever the cause it's doing his fantasy value no favors. He won't carry you in any category and is hurting from the line (64.9% on 2.3 attempts), but is still a decent low-end option.

             Those treys were a career-high for the Finnish marksman and he match a Bulls rookie record for most treys in a game. Markkanen was already tearing it up in 2018 with an incredible 71.1 TS% on his 18.3 usage rate in his previous games this month, so this monster game isn't a surprise. There's a chance Zach LaVine (knee) takes a small chunk out of the rookie's usage, but his fantasy owners should not be worried whatsoever, especially with how lights out he's been lately.

He handled himself with aplomb and is now averaging 8.8 points, 9.7 rebounds and 1.7 blocked shots per game over the past nine outings. Biyombo is making the sting of Nikola Vucevic's (hand) loss a little more tolerable lately.

             That is one ugly shooting line, but Dunn hit a huge bank shot in the lane to help earn this win. The steals were somewhat expected from Dunn this year, but now in the mix with Russell Westbrook for No. 2 in the league in steals per game. Dunn's scoring has been a pleasant surprise and the return of Zach LaVine (knee) shouldn't hurt Dunn's scoring output too much, and maybe it'll open up the floor for him to boost his FG%. Dunn should continue to coast in what has been a mini-breakout season.

            Aaron Gordon finished with 11 points, four rebounds and an assist across 30 minutes Wednesday in Milwaukee, but he hit just 4-of-18 from the field.
        
        
             Gordon returned to the starting lineup Wednesday after being benched Tuesday for showing up late for the team's flight. He supplanted Mario Hezonja, who was very efficient off the bench. Despite the poor shooting night, it's unlikely Gordon will be removed again from the starting five anytime soon. If you normally depend on Gordon for fantasy purposes, get him back in the active lineup.

            Maxi Kleber came off the bench vs. Charlotte and had four points on 2-of-7 shooting, one rebound, one assist and a pair of steals in 12 minutes.
        
        
             Kleber was trending down in a hurry as a starter, and the bottom fell out on Tuesday as he played only four minutes and was nearly a DNP in the second half. This was the first time since mid-December that the Mavs used a different starting lineup, and coach Rick Carlisle didn't make the move lightly, so presumably Kleber will stay on the bench for the foreseeable future.

            Dwight Powell had another quiet game on Wednesday with three points, two rebounds and one block in 12 minutes.
        
        
             Powell was surging in late December and early January, but in the past three games he's fallen off with averages of 4.0 points, 3.0 rebounds, 0.7 assists, 0.3 blocks and zero steals. Unless your waiver wire is totally barren, it makes sense to cut Powell for another flavor-of-the-week big man like Ekpe Udoh.

            Justin Holiday scored 16 points with nine rebounds, two assists, one steal and two 3-pointers in 45 minutes against the Knicks during a double-overtime win on Wednesday.
        
        
             While the Holiday season is over, there should still be a decent opportunity for Justin even when Zach LaVine (knee) makes his season debut on Saturday. Holiday's minutes have held steady at 34 per game, so that number is probably going to move close to 30. He should still get a chance in the starting lineup, and coach Fred Hoiberg still went to him to close even though both Denzel Valentine and David Nwaba played well -- he was the main wing in OT, too. Holiday should still be held in standard leagues with owners expecting double-digit scoring, two-plus treys and plenty of other counting stats.

            David Nwaba scored 13 points with five rebounds, one assist, one steal and one block in 32 minutes against the Knicks on Wednesday.
        
        
             He only scored four points in the first three quarters, but Nwaba really played well late with seven points in the fourth and had a huge block on Michael Beasley in the last minute. Coach Fred Hoiberg loves his hustle and that's a big reason why he saw so much run in OT, but Nwaba is likely looking at a hit to his playing time. Zach LaVine (knee) is expected to make his debut on Saturday, so Nwaba should be dropped in most leagues now.

             This comes on the heels of a career-high 19 points on Monday night, but he still didn't play most of the late minutes in the game with David Nwaba out there. Valentine did hit a huge 3-pointer with 7:42 left in the game to give the Bulls their first lead of the game, and this was one of his better games of the year. The timing of this is interesting because Valentine is fully expected to take a hit in playing time with Zach LaVine (knee) set to make his Bulls debut on Saturday. Despite this great line, Valentine is probably more of a drop than an add.

""[Ferrell] always finds a way to fit in because he goes hard and he maximizes his minutes,"" he said. ""[On Tuesday] we couldn’t have won without him."" It's unclear whether Carlisle intends to make this a permanent change, but that's a real possibility given his play over the past few games. Ferrell is a very intriguing pickup while we wait to find out.

             Hood already had one technical and he jawed at the refs again to end the third quarter, which earned him an early exit. He knocked a phone out of a fan's hand after the ejection, so he could get fined, but we doubt he'll face a suspension. It can't hurt to double-check his status, but he should be back to his usual 28-30 minute role vs. Charlotte on Friday.

            Jason Kidd said he's hopeful to get Jabari Parker (knee) back to the floor the week before the All-Star break.
        
        
             Parker has been ramping up his activities recently, getting through full contact, 5-on-5 work with Milwaukee's G-League affiliate, and him getting out there prior to the All-Star break would be an impressive achievement. That said, he's suffered two ACL tears to the same knee over a three-year span, so he'll assuredly be dealing with a plethora of restrictions early, and back-to-back sets will likely be a season-long issue. He has enough upside to justify a stash in deep leagues, but know that he might not even be worth using in fantasy hoops until March.

             Jones' recent stint as a starter wasn't exactly a goldmine for fantasy purposes, and he takes a big hit with Teague back in action. Check back after the game to see how he fared.

            Jeff Teague (knee) will be in the starting lineup for Wednesday's game against the Thunder.
        
        
             With Teague back in action, Tyus Jones will likely return to the bench, and Jones value will take a massive hit with the move back to the second unit. We haven't had any word on a minutes limit for Teague, but it's worth pointing out that he logged 34 minutes in his return from a four-game absence earlier in the year (oddly enough that game was also against OKC), so he's probably safe to activate in season-long settings.

             Ujiri said that Lowry is still in a lot of pain and that the Raptors will be ""smart"" with bringing him back from this injury, so it sounds like there's a decent chance he'll be watching from the sidelines on Thursday against the Cavs and Saturday against the Warriors. Delon Wright should continue to start in his absence with Fred VanVleet backing him up, with DeMar DeRozan's usage going into the ridiculous range.

            Anthony Davis (ankle) will sit out Wednesday's game against the Grizzlies, and Dante Cunningham will start in his place.
        
        
             While Cunningham will get the start, he rarely brings meaningful statistics to the box score regardless of his minutes allotment, so he's still not a great target in most leagues. Per nbawowy.com, with Davis off the court, DeMarcus Cousins' usage rate spikes to 38.2, so he'll be a very attractive DFS target today. The Pelicans play again on Friday against Portland, and for now, we'll be considering Davis questionable for that one.

            Damian Lillard (right calf strain) will play Wednesday vs. the Rockets, but coach Terry Stotts said that Lillard will ""probably"" have a minutes limit.
        
        
             Lillard missed each of the Blazers last two games but returns with a favorable fantasy matchup against the fast-paced Rockets. However, with a possible minutes limit looming, Lillard is a risky DFS option. Shabazz Napier gets bumped back to the bench, and back to waivers in standard fantasy leagues, with Dame healthy.

As a starter this season, Jerebko has posted averages of 9.1 points, 4.0 boards, 1.4 triples and 1.1 assists per contest, so he's basically just a low-end streaming option in deep leagues.

             Dallas made the move to open up a roster spot for Jalen Jones, but there's no fantasy spin to this news as Collinsworth was a negligible part of the rotation.

             In case you missed it, Curry slipped and tweaked his ankle at shootaround and will sit out Wednesday's game, but the Warriors don't seem overly concerned about the ankle tweak, and the fact that they're not even seeking a precautionary MRI is definitely good news. Klay Thompson (rest) will be joining Curry on the sidelines tonight, so Shaun Livingston and Patrick McCaw could be guys to think about streaming, while Kevin Durant (calf) will make for an attractive DFS option.

             Green has spent the past four games on the sidelines, and we haven't seen any reports of him ramping up his activities at practices, so we'd peg him closer to doubtful than questionable. If he's out again on Thursday, Bryn Forbes will get another chance to start with more minutes and there will be slightly more minutes available for Brandon Paul. Stay tuned.

             Parker sprained his ankle during the fourth quarter of Monday's win over the Kings, and given the way the Spurs tend to handle injuries with their older guys, it wouldn't be surprising at all to see Parker hit the sidelines on Thursday. Dejounte Murray will start if he sits and there will be more minutes available for Patty Mills. Check back for official confirmation on Parker's status following Thursday morning's shootaround.

             We are still mostly in the dark when it comes to Leonard's shoulder injury. Hopefully, we'll get a thorough update from coach Gregg Popovich shortly. However, this is the Spurs we are dealing with, so transparency is not what we should expect. Rudy Gay (heel) has also been ruled out for Thursday, and Danny Green (groin) is listed as questionable, so Kyle Anderson will likely draw another start and log 30-plus minutes. Bryn Forbes will see an uptick in playing time as well.

             Chriss was unable to return to Sunday's game after exiting in the second quarter due to the hip injury. Dragan Bender started the second half in place of Chriss and finished with 20 points, six 3-pointers, six boards, four assists and three blocks. Triano did say that Bender would draw the start on Friday if Chriss is unable to suit up.

Assuming Johnson doesn't appeal the suspension, he will not be available for Wednesday's game vs. Indiana. The Heat could go in any number of directions based on matchups, with Jordan Mickey, Bam Adebayo, Kelly Olynyk and Derrick Jones Jr. all potentially logging a few extra minutes.

             Curry slipped at practice on Wednesday and sprained his right ankle. This is worrisome because it's the same ankle that sidelined him for 11 games in December. However, beat writer Connor Letourneau is reporting that a Warriors source told him Curry's ankle ""doesn’t look serious at all, but we’re not taking any chances on anything this year."" Let's hope that's the case. Shaun Livingston will likely start at PG on Wednesday. Kevin Durant (calf) has been cleared to play and will be the focus of the Dubs offense.

            Damian Lillard (right calf strain) is questionable for Wednesday's game vs. Houston.
        
        
             Lillard told reporters that he felt ""really good"" on Tuesday. The Blazers didn't hold a shootaround Wednesday morning, so we haven't had heard from Lillard or coach Terry Stotts today. We will likely have to wait until Stotts addresses the media pregame to get a reliable update on Dame's status for this evening. If Lillard is unable to play Shabazz Napier will draw another start and will be a chalky DFS play.

             Earlier in the week, Teodosic said he was hopeful he'd return on either Wednesday or Thursday. It appears he has a decent chance of getting back on the floor for the second night of this back-to-back. With Teodosic sidelined on Wednesday, Lou Williams and Jawun Evans are expected to once again start in the Clippers backcourt. Williams has been a fantasy monster the last few weeks, and Evans tallied 13 points, eight rebounds, four assists, four steals and one block in 39 minutes on Monday. He'll be a popular DFS target Wednesday.

             This is not surprising, as Griffin said on Tuesday that he was expecting to miss this contest. The Clippers next game is Thursday vs. the Kings, and there is an outside chance he clears concussion protocol by then. Wes Johnson, Sam Dekker and Montrezl Harrell should continue to divvy up additional minutes in Griffin's absence.

             Scott Brooks already said on Tuesday that Porter would be back out there for Wednesday's game, so the probable tag is just a formality and owners can go ahead and get him active following his one-game stint on the sidelines. With Porter back, Kelly Oubre will return to the bench and his value will take a bit of a hit with the demotion to the second unit.

Teague appears to be on track to return from a seven-game stint on the sidelines tonight, which would shift Tyus Jones back to the second unit and his value would take a major hit. Tom Thibodeau wouldn't say how many minutes Teague would play if he gets out there, but it's worth noting that in Teague's return from a four-game absence earlier in the year, he logged 34 minutes in his first game back.

            Tyler Johnson (shoulder) is being listed as questionable for Wednesday's game against the Pacers.
        
        
             The Heat won't host a shootaround with this being the second game of a back-to-back set, so Johnson is essentially a game-time call tonight. He said he shoulder flared up on him while going through a ballhandling exercise during Tuesday's shootaround, but said it wasn't the same sort of pain he experienced when he required surgery on his rotator cuff back in 2016. The Heat may want to play it safe and keep him on the sidelines, which would present Derrick Jones Jr. with another opportunity to start. Stay tuned.

             This means that Turner will miss Wednesday's game against the Heat as well as Friday's matchup with Cleveland, which will shift Domantas Sabonis into the first unit, and he could be someone to think about in daily leagues. After Friday's game, the Pacers have a Sunday-Monday back-to-back set, so there's a chance he could miss Sunday's game as well. Stay tuned.

             ""I mean I was doing a ballhandling drill and I don’t know,"" Johnson said of how the injury occurred. ""It just kind of got real and I felt kind of a sharp pain, an irritation. We’re not 100%, but it doesn’t feel like how it did in the past. In the past it was a totally different [pain]... it wasn’t a soreness, it was an actual pain that was going through my shoulder. So I don’t feel that. It doesn’t feel anything close to what that was like."" It's unclear if Johnson will be able to get back out there for Wednesday's game vs. the Pacers, but if he's out again, Derrick Jones Jr. will have another opportunity to start.

That said, he wasn't playing very well prior to going down, and he might not have a spot in the starting five once he's back with how good Dario Saric has been lately, so it's tough to justify stashing him outside of deep leagues.

             ""It’s just a habit for him of doing more, of getting more, of being more consistent with all of it,"" said Spoelstra of what he's looking for from Whiteside. ""And I won’t stop with my expectations for him and what this team needs from him."" Whiteside finally saw his playing time hit the 30-minute mark during Tuesday's win over Toronto, a game in which he finished with 13 points, 15 boards and two swats, so hopefully, that's a trend that will continue moving forward.

Green has excelled in Mike D'Antoni's uptempo offense sans James Harden, posting averages of 17.3 points, 3.0 boards and 4.1 triples on 51.3% shooting through seven games in Houston, so he's worth owning everywhere while he's this hot.

             ""Maybe it’s more face-ups and just shooting over guys and living with that result,"" said Gasol. ""Although it might not be the best shot, it might be the only shot I’m going to get... You want to be able to attack the paint and do stuff. But the paint has been very populated lately."" Outside of Tyreke Evans, the Grizzlies don't have a legit perimeter threat, which has made it easy for opposing teams to send double teams at Gasol. As a result, he's connecting on a career-low 41.4% of his FGA this season, and as long as Mike Conley (Achilles) is out, it'll be tough to correct that issue.

             Favors and Mirotic make roughly the same amount of money, so this could be a straight-up swap, although the Bulls reportedly would like a first-round pick as well. If the Bulls bring on Favors without parting ways with Robin Lopez, Favors would find himself in an unfavorable situation fighting for minutes in Chicago's crowded frontcourt. A trade can't officially go down until January 15, and the Bulls have also received interest from the Pistons, so it'll be interesting to see how this plays out.

For what it's worth, if Durant can score at least 25 points tonight, he'll become the second-youngest player in NBA history (behind LeBron James) to hit the 20,000-point mark.

I did a workout [Tuesday] morning, worked out [pregame] again, did some conditioning, and felt good."" The Blazers won't have a shootaround this morning with Wednesday's game being the second of a back-to-back set, so we likely won't get another update on Lillard until he's going through his pregame routine. If he's out again, Shabazz Napier will draw another start and he'll make for a solid DFS option.

            Bogdan Bogdanovic replaced Malachi Richardson in the starting lineup in the second half on Tuesday and finished with 19 points, two rebounds, four assists and a steal, but also missed all three of his 3-point attempts.
        
        
             He hit 7-of-13 shots and played 32 minutes. The Kings are desperate for offense and Bogdanovic might be one of their most capable scorers. He's quietly scored in double figures in four straight games and might be worth a look right now. He's averaging 13 points, 3.2 rebounds, 4.8 assists and 1.0 3-pointers on 51 percent shooting over his last five. He had some kind of right foot problem that caused him to go to the locker room briefly, but quickly returned and played through it.

            Garrett Temple started the second half over Buddy Hield on Tuesday but hit just 1-of-6 shots for three points and two steals.
        
        
             He took a hard shot to his left thigh from Larry Nance in the second half, but was able to stay in the game. If he does miss any time with the injury, it would benefit Hield slightly, but neither player is at a must-own level right now.

            Kosta Koufos came off the bench for six points, a season-high 15 rebounds, two assists and three steals in 21 minutes on Tuesday.
        
        
             Not only was this one of his best games in recent memory, but it was his first double-digit rebound game since Nov. 11. Koufos would need for Willie Cauley-Stein to go down with an injury to have any real fantasy value, but he does have six steals in his last three games.

             He may have tweaked an ankle tonight, but looked fine in the second half, despite coming off the bench. Hield has struggled for most of the season, but is playing a little better, averaging 11.6 points and 2.8 3-pointers over his last five games, despite hitting just 36 percent of his shots. He doesn't do much besides mediocre scoring and hitting threes's, making him  a borderline hold right now, depending on who else is on your waiver wire.

             George Hill was out again for personal reasons and Fox played pretty well, despite a late airball that kind of summed up the Kings' night. Fox is playing much better right now, averaging 15.3 points, 2.8 rebounds, 6.0 assists, 1.3 steals and 1.3 3-pointers over his last four games, shooting 46 percent. He could be poised for a second-half breakout and has scored in double figures in four straight games, so make sure he's not available in your league.

             A replay appeared to show Hield tweaking his right ankle before halftime, but he is playing in the second half.

             He pulled himself out of the game and didn't seem to be limping too badly, and started unlacing his right shoe before being taken to the locker room. He was able to return later in the game, so the injury isn't an issue.

             He hit the game-winning shot, which was surprisingly a layup instead of a 3-pointer, and was one of several heroes for the Heat on Tuesday. Ellington's a 3-point specialist, but the Heat are banged up and he's getting a lot of run right now. He's averaging 14.4 points, 4.4 rebounds, 1.2 steals and 3.8 3-pointers over his last five games. He's shooting just 41 percent during that stretch, but is also getting 34 minutes a night. If you need threes he's an automatic pick up, but he probably belongs on waivers if your team is already solid in that area.

             Jonathan Simmons (back) was back in the starting lineup, but Aaron Gordon was brought off the bench for violating a team rule (he was late for the team's plane on Monday). Hezonja came off the bench to start the second half, but he looks so much more confident these days and his stash appeal is growing with the Magic expected to be sellers at the deadline -- Evan Fournier is one of the names linked to a move out of Orlando.

             The Magic usually turn to Speights when they are in comeback mode and that was the case tonight. This was his first game with 20+ minutes since Nov. 24, so he's not worth adding in most formats.

             He had four fouls, was a -28 in his 20 minutes and added just two assists and one rebound. Orlando only had a couple players play well tonight, so this loss wasn't just on Simmons. He's been battling back spasms for nearly a week and that may be why he's slumping, as he's hit just 13 of his last 53 shots (24.5%). His owners may need to move on if he doesn't get it going against the Bucks on Wednesday.

             This was Ferrell's highest scoring game since before Christmas and he combined with Dennis Smith Jr. and J.J. Barea to help the Mavs' backcourt dominate the Magic tonight. Barea added eight points and tied his season high with 12 assists in the win. We'd still rank the three Smith Jr., Barea and then Ferrell, but Yogi looked good after scoring six points in each of his previous two games.

             The Magic brought him off the bench because he was late for their team plane on Monday, but he saw his normal allotment of minutes (33) and finished with eight rebounds, two assists and one triple. He was 6-of-16 from the field and 6-of-8 from the line, but it says a lot about his improvement that this is considered an off night. He should be back in his usual role on Wednesday vs. the Bucks and will likely see a lot of Giannis Antetokounmpo.

He did a lot of his damage late in the fourth quarter with the Mavs holding a commanding lead, but it was also good for his confidence. He's scored in double figures in six straight games and this was his first game with an attempted free throw where he didn't miss at least one since November. He's coming on, averaging 16.7 points, 4.7 rebounds, 6.5 assists and 1.5 steals over his last six games.

             Dirk was tied with Dennis Smith Jr. as the team's leading scorer and still hasn't missed a game this season. Dirk was just 1-of-7 for five points on Sunday, so it was nice to see him bounce back in this one. He's been a pleasant surprise this fantasy season, returning seventh-round value in nine-cat leagues.

             The Blazers are now 9-3 when McCollum scores 25 or more points, and he also finished the night with seven assists, three rebounds, one steal and one triple in 33 minutes. McCollum has a 30.7 usage rate when Damian Lillard (calf) is off the floor, so he'll be a popular DFS target once again on Wednesday vs. Houston if Lillard can't go.

             Nurkic picked up four fouls, so that prevented him from having a monster night. His owners should still be thrilled with this line, as Steven Adams and the Thunder have allowed the sixth fewest fantasy points to centers this season. Nurk Alert gets a boost when Damian Lillard (calf) is out, but it's unclear if Portland's franchise player will be available on Wednesday vs. Houston.

             The Thunder have allowed the seventh fewest fantasy points to PGs this season, making Napier's performance even more impressive. He made 10 trips to the free throw line and connected on nine of them, adding five rebounds, two assists, two steals and two treys in 34 minutes. He's become a must-start player every time Damian Lillard (calf) misses a game and was averaging 18.2 points, 5.4 assists, 4.8 rebounds, 2.0 steals and 1.8 triples in five previous starts. Lillard's status for Wednesday's game vs. Houston is up in the air, so be on the lookout for an update.

             Since going off for 24 points on 9-of-12 shooting last Wednesday, Ferguson has scored a total of 13 points with 11 fouls and not much else over his last three games. He might have one or two more big games in his future this season, but if you picked him up on a whim, it's probably time to go fishing on your waiver wire. Andre Roberson (knee) isn't expected to play on Wednesday, so Ferguson could be looking at another start.

             This was a bad loss for OKC after falling to Phoenix on Sunday, while this is the sixth time this season Westy has missed a triple-double by just one assist or one rebound. The turnovers and poor shooting continue, but the guy just puts up monster numbers every time out. Paul George, Carmelo Anthony and Steven Adams all scored between 16 and 22 points, but the Thunder didn't have an answer for the Blazers tonight.

             He was terrific on both ends, finishing 5-of-9 from the field and 2-of-2 from the line without a turnover in 29 minutes. Wright has really nice upside in category leagues for his defensive stats and triples, and this was his sixth game out of his last nine with at least one steal, one block and one triple. He's trending up and is worth owning while he's hot, especially while Kyle Lowry is day-to-day with a back injury.

             James Johnson was ejected for fighting and should be facing a one-game suspension, which means we could see a lot more Bam on Wednesday night. He was also playing alongside Hassan Whiteside tonight, which is more good news. Bam should be a strong play on Wednesday and is worth keeping a close eye on going forward.

             DeRozan was one of the hottest players in the NBA coming into tonight's game with 35.5 points over his last four outings and he has a 39.2 usage rate with Kyle Lowry (back) off the floor, but Josh Richardson's defense slowed him down. He narrowly missed a full-court heave with 0.3 seconds left on the clock, but he had an altercation with Goran Dragic after the game and may have thrown a punch (link below). If you own him, just make sure he's not suspended for Thursday's game vs. the Cavaliers before deploying him.

             Tyler Johnson was out and Josh Richardson appeared to be playing point guard for much of the night, so Dragic focused on scoring and rebounding, helping the Heat to a season-high 64 boards. Johnson doesn't sound likely for Wednesday with his shoulder injury, so Dragic should have another big game. Dragic got into a scuffle with DeMar DeRozan while walking off the court, but if anyone threw a punch, it was DeRozan. However, it was more of a slap or push than a punch, in our opinion, so a suspension probably isn't coming.

            Jonas Valanciunas was quiet on Tuesday vs. the Heat with eight points, three rebounds and two blocks.
        
        
             He was 4-of-8 from the field, but only played 21 minutes even though Serge Ibaka was ejected early in the third quarter. J-Val is coming off two monster games in a row, but he's only played 20+ minutes in two out of his last five games. With Ibaka likely suspended for Thursday's game vs. the Cavaliers, he'll be in a great spot to bounce back.

             J-Rich still filled the stat sheet, but had one of his toughest nights of the season. He injured his left shoulder late in the game, but stayed in and said he'd ice it and be ready for Wednesday. The Heat have won five straight games and Richardson has played the entire fourth quarter in all five of them.

             Ibaka gave JJ a little shove, but the Heat forward responded by throwing a punch. Ibaka threw one back, so both players were ejected with double technicals. He'll be facing a fine at the very least, and don't be surprised if he's suspended as well. We'll consider him questionable to play on Wednesday vs. the Pacers. The Heat are giving the Bam Adebayo-Hassan Whiteside combo a look, so the rookie could see a bump if JJ misses time.

The Clippers do play again on Thursday vs. the Kings, so maybe he'll be back in time for that one. With Griffin out, we should see more minutes falling to guys like Wes Johnson, Sam Dekker and Montrezl Harrell.

             Tuesday's game tips off at 8:30 pm EST, so we should have confirmation, one way or the other, within the hour. Simmons will be somewhat difficult to trust if he does suit up, as he will likely play relatively limited minutes. If Simmons is ruled out, Mario Hezonja will probably draw another start.

             Lowry was ruled out earlier in the day due to a back injury suffered in Monday's win over the Nets. Wright has been playing well of late and has a chance to log heavy minutes in his first start of the season. Over the Raps last three games, Wright is averaging 14.7 points (on 63.0 percent shooting), 6.7 rebounds, 4.0 assists and 2.0 steals in 26.3 minutes. Wright will be a very chalky DFS play Monday night. Fred VanVleet will also see an uptick in minutes off the bench.

That won't stop the Hawks from throwing Prince on the injury report with the probable tag, though.

             All these guys were probable on Monday, and they all played, so that trend should continue on Wednesday night. Knowing how Atlanta likes to list injuries, this group could see the probable tag for the next month. Dedmon logged 20 minutes in his return to action on Monday, so maybe he'll get closer to the 25-range on Wednesday.

Head coach Erik Spoelstra wouldn't commit to having Johnson available for Wednesday's game in Indiana, and with that one being the second of a back-to-back, there will not be a shootaround so we likely won't get an update until just prior to tip-off. Goran Dragic, Josh Richardson and Wayne Ellington figure to log heavy minutes tonight.

             While we typically don't go off the game notes, Wright starting sans Lowry just makes the most sense and Dwane Casey tends to not release lineup changes until just a few minutes prior to tip-off, so we're throwing this out there. Wright has played very well as a reserve this season, and with him likely to see his minutes in the 30s tonight, he'll make for a strong DFS option. Check back for official confirmation on the starters closer to tip-off.RotoGrinders.com Daily Slant: With Lowry and all non-rotation members off the floor, DeMar DeRozan leads the Raptors in usage by a huge margin at 43.5%, a massive +11.9% differential from his seasonal number. Wright and VanVleet have nearly identical usage rates and FPPM marks (20.4 vs. 20.5 and .89 to .86), but we'll give Wright the nod due to his ability to rack up defensive stats.

Crabbe fell awkwardly after making a game-tying layup. Afterward, he said he was confident he'd be able to play Wednesday, but is apparently in more pain than he expected. We should have another update after Wednesday's shootaround. DeMarre Carroll (knee) has already been ruled out. Caris LeVert and Joe Harris could be forced to log heavy minutes.

             The Pistons and Jazz have now officially been named as teams that are looking to acquire the 26-year-old power forward, but the Bulls can't officially trade him until January 15. They're reportedly seeking a first-round selection in any Mirotic trade, but it is worth noting that a clause was put into Mirotic's contract this summer that gives him veto power in any trade. However, with Mirotic being the one that requested the trade in the first place, that veto thing might not end up being an issue.

            Paul Millsap (left wrist surgery) had his cast removed on Tuesday.
        
        
             To be clear, Millsap still isn't expected back until after the All-Star break, but this is a small step in the right direction. We'll continue to track Millsap's progress every step of the way, but if you're in a league without an IR-spot, it's probably still a bit too early to stash him.

             It looks like Wednesday will mark Parsons' fifth straight game on the sidelines, as he just can't seem to shake this knee issue, so Jarell Martin and JaMychal Green will continue to pick up the slack in his absence.

             It looks like he'll be returning from a one-game absence on Wednesday, which will likely shift Wayne Selden back to the second unit and Mario Chalmers minutes could take a hit. As a starter this season, Harrison has produced averages of 8.0 points, 2.4 assists and not much else on 37.5% shooting, so even as a starter, he's not worth owning in most leagues.

             The Nets did briefly open the year with a Jeremy Lin-Russell starting backcourt, so it wouldn't be too shocking to see Atkinson role with a slightly different two PG lineup. Atkinson said that Russell has proven he can play well off the ball, and Dinwiddie's size allows him to defend other two-guards, so maybe Dinwiddie's value won't take quite as big of a hit once Russell gets back to the court.

             This was Carroll's surgically repaired knee, so it's fantastic news that he's not dealing with any sort of structural damage, and while he could miss Wednesday's game against the Pistons it doesn't sound like he'll be out long. Joe Harris logged 37 minutes as a starter on Monday with Carroll unavailable, finishing with 12 points, six boards, two triples, two assists and a steal on 36.4% shooting, so he could be used a streamer in deep leagues on Wednesday sans Carroll.

             Mason is now one-week removed from his initial rough one-week timetable, but there haven't been any reports of him ramping up his activity level at practice, so it doesn't seem like he's all that close. The Kings have zero incentive to have a guy play at less than 100 percent this season, so Mason might miss Thursday's game against the Clippers as well. De'Aaron Fox has been playing well with Mason and George Hill (personal) on the sidelines, so he's officially put himself on the DFS radar.

We'll have a better idea on his status based on his activity level at practices leading up to Friday's tip, but if he doesn't need to spend any time on the sidelines, Dragan Bender's value will take a fairly substantial hit.

            Domantas Sabonis (wrist) practiced fully on Tuesday and said he is ""good to go"" for Wednesday's game vs. the Heat.
        
        
             Sabonis fell on his wrist late in Monday's win over Milwaukee, but the X-rays taken after the game came back clean. Myles Turner (elbow) is listed as questionable for Wednesday's game. Sabonis would likely replace Turner in the starting lineup if Myles is unable to suit up. Sabonis is averaging an impressive  12.9 points, 11.0 rebounds, and 3.3 assists in the eight games he has started this season.

            Coach Nate McMillan said Myles Turner is dealing with a sore elbow and is questionable for Wednesday's game vs. Miami.
        
        
             Turner finished with 15 points, six rebounds and three blocks across 24 minutes in the Pacers blowout victory over the Bucks on Monday night, but injured his arm on a dunk. If Turner is unable to play, Domantas Sabonis (wrist) would likely slide into the starting lineup. Turner said he hopes to feel better on Wednesday. We should have another update on Turner's status after the Pacers shootaround Wednesday morning.

             Simmons was unable to finish Wednesday's game vs. Houston and was ruled out of Saturday's game vs. the Cavs. The fact that he was able to shoot around this morning is a positive sign, but we'll have to wait and see how his back is feeling this evening. If Simmons is unable to play, Mario Hezonja will likely draw another start in his place. Hezonja tallied 16 points and ten rebounds across 39 minutes on Saturday.

            Kyle Lowry has been diagnosed with a bruised tailbone and back spasms and has been ruled out of Tuesday's game vs. Miami.
        
        
             Today's update, including the fact that Lowry's X-rays came back negative, certainly qualifies as good news. When Lowry crashed to the floor on Monday night, and then crumbled back down to the court as he tried to get up, before being carried back to the locker room, it seemed as though he might be dealing with a serious injury. However, Lowry is considered day-to-day and could be back in the lineup by the end of this week. Fred VanVleet and Delon Wright are expected to divvy up Lowry's minutes on Tuesday.

             This is wonderful news, as it appeared Lowry might be dealing with a significant injury after he had to be carried off the floor and into the locker room after a scary fall Monday night in Brooklyn. The Raptors have yet to provide an update on his status for Tuesday's game vs. Miami. However, even if he has to miss a game or two, it appears he is expected to return to the Toronto lineup sooner rather than later. Raptors fans and Lowry owners can now exhale.

Paxson also stated that LaVine will be held out of the second night of back-to-backs through the All-Star break. These restrictions were expected and it means we have to temper our expectations for LaVine out of the gate. Nonetheless, it's great news that he's cleared all the necessary hurdles and has been medically cleared to get back on the floor. He averaged 18.9 points, 3.4 rebounds, 3.0 assists and 2.6 treys per game for Minnesota last season.

""It’s always been weird since my rookie year when I’d play 35 [minutes], and then I’d play seven [minutes],"" said Hezonja. ""I’ve been asked many times if it is confidence, but it’s not confidence at all. It’s just that rhythm and it’s NBA rhythm.""

            Joe Young is earning increased playing time due to his improved play on both sides of the ball.
        
        
             Young averaged just 6.3 minutes per contest over his first 18 appearances this season. However, over the Pacers last four games, Young is averaging 10.0 points, 2.8 rebounds, 1.8 assists and 1.3 treys in 19.1 minutes. He's not yet on the fantasy radar in standard leagues, but he's heading in the right direction.

             Morris has yet to play more than 27 minutes in any game this season. He's also been held out of back-to-backs. Hopefully, he's turning the corner in regards to his knee issue, but as of now, he's still difficult to trust in standard leagues. We'll see how he is deployed Thursday and over the next few contests.

             Horford did not play Saturday after experiencing some soreness in Friday's game. The Celtics don't play until Thursday, when they take on the Sixers in London, and then have four more days off after that contest. The fact that he is already practicing fully is a good sign that he'll be ready to roll on Thursday. We'll update his progress throughout the week.

             Bogut was released by the Lakers on Saturday and reportedly cleared waivers Monday night, which means he is eligible to sign with any team he chooses. The Bucks traded away Greg Monroe in the deal for Eric Bledsoe, so they could use a rebounder off the bench. However, Bogut it's highly unlikely he would make enough of an impact to have fantasy relevancy.

             The Clippers were probably hoping to play him more, but C.J. Williams had the hot hand tonight and hit the game-winning triple. It's just a two-game sample size, but Wallace has certainly looked like an NBA player so far and is worth keeping an eye on with the Clippers so banged up.

Evans is now averaging 12.5 points, 6.0 rebounds, 5.5 assists and 2.5 steals in his last two starts, making him an intriguing short-term pickup with Austin Rivers (heel) out at least a couple more weeks and Milos Teodosic's (foot) timetable still up in the air. The Clippers also play three more times this week.

He finished 12-of-29 from the field and 6-of-6 from the line, adding four assists, three rebounds, four triples and six turnovers. ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski reported on Monday that Williams will be a popular name at the trade deadline and it's easy to see why with his expiring cap-friendly contract.

             ""I've made that shot before. Just a rhythm dribble to my left,"" Williams said. ""I felt the momentum and the excitement of the moment. I shot it with confidence and as soon as I let it go, I knew it was good."" Williams has been playing big minutes for the injury-depleted Clippers, but his production has been anything but consistent and he scored a combined 12 points in his last two games. The Clippers will have to decide later this month if they want to sign him for the remainder of the season, as players with two-way contracts only have NBA eligibility for 45 days.

             We're not sure what's going on in Atlanta, but it's definitely odd to see Tyler Cavanaugh, Miles Plumlee and Mike Muscala play more than one of the top rookie bigs this season. Dewayne Dedmon returned to action and played 20 minutes, so this frontcourt rotation could be very crowded in the short term until coach Mike Budenholzer makes some necessary changes. ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski reported on Monday that the Hawks will be active sellers at the deadline, so treat Collins like a high-upside stash.

             He played a team-high 36 minutes, adding four rebounds, three assists, one steal, two blocks and four 3-pointers. He was all over the place on both ends of the floor, but his final shot attempt to win the game went wide left. ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski reported on Monday morning that the Hawks will be shopping veterans such as Kent Bazemore, Ersan Ilyasova and Marco Belinelli at the deadline, but Prince's role is safe as one of the building blocks of the franchise.

             Iguodala has been a regular on the Warriors' injury report lately, but he played 30 minutes tonight due to Kevin Durant's absence. There's no reason to think he'll miss the Warriors' final two games this week, Wednesday vs. the Clippers and Friday vs. the Bucks. Still, Iguodala's deep-league owners know the drill -- confirm his status after each shootaround, just to be safe.

             Green's constant presence on the Warriors' injury report makes him seem like more of an injury risk than he really has been -- other than a mid-December stretch with five DNPs, he's missed just one game (Nov. 24). He also averaged 38.0 minutes in a back-to-back set in early January, which is a great sign, and owners shouldn't fret about his availability until the bitter end of the regular season.

             Curry came in with a sore left knee and he'll undoubtedly be on the Warriors' injury report for Wednesday's home game, but we'll get a better sense of his status on Tuesday. He was coming off a 45-point gem and Kevin Durant's absence has ensured Curry is very busy offensively -- he's now averaging 35.3 points over the past three games. To quote Nuggets coach Mike Malone, Curry is playing ""at a ridiculously high rate."" Check back after Tuesday's shootaround for the latest on his knee.

His lack of fantasy upside is self-evident, but it's worth mentioning that tonight's 11-point game was the result of his third-highest usage all season (26.5%).

             Casspi's appeal in 12-team fantasy leagues is negligible, although he's occasionally worth streaming if Kevin Durant is out. Tonight, Durant was out with a calf injury tonight, which gave Casspi just enough playing time, but that could end vs. the Clippers on Wednesday.

             The Kings have used Bogdanovic as a playmaker a lot more recently, especially while George Hill (personal) and Frank Mason (heel) have been out. He recorded five assists, five rebounds and two triples in 33 minutes, and he's now dished out at least five dimes in five out of his last six games. His rest-of-season outlook is really promising and the Kings have three more games this week, so this is a good time to take a flier on him if he's available.

             Barton had been slumping from the field at 37.5% in his previous four games, but the low playing time was an unusual twist. This is the second time all season Barton has played fewer than 20 minutes, and the first time since Nov. 24, so we'll keep an eye out for any explanations. It looks like Denver just stuck with bigger lineups that were effective down the stretch.

             Nuggets coach Mike Malone recently vowed to ""trust"" his bench more, to avoid burning out his key players, but he basically stuck with an 8-man rotation tonight. Jamal Murray logged 42 minutes, Gary Harris logged 35 minutes, and the frontcourt was a combination of Nikola Jokic, Wilson Chandler, Mason Plumlee and Trey Lyles. That's great if you own the aforementioned players, but it makes Mudiay and Faried irrelevant unless they're traded.

             Lyles said his confidence is at an ""all-time high,"" which isn't surprising considering he's averaging 17.4 points on 57.6% shooting over the past month. When coach Mike Malone was asked about Lyles' meticulous pre-game shooting routines, he replied, ""The level he’s playing at right now —  whatever you’re doing, Trey, keep on doing it.""

The Kings have told him to be more aggressive recently and he averaged 17.5 points, 5.5 assists, 3.0 rebounds, 1.0 steals, 0.5 triples and 3.5 turnovers in his previous two games, so hopefully that is an indication that coach Dave Joerger is loosening the leash.

             His athleticism was too much for the Spurs to handle as WCS notched 20+ points for the fifth time this season. He was 8-of-12 from the field and 6-of-8 from the line with nine rebounds and three turnovers in 30 minutes, but he didn't record any blocks or steals. You'd think he'd have more than one block over his last five games for as athletic and long as he is, so until he improves in that area he will be a low-end big in standard 9-category leagues.

             The four fouls slowed him down, but it wasn't a strong game from him by any means as he hit 4-of-12 shots with two turnovers. Until the Kings turn their focus towards player development, Randolph will continue to be a steady source of points and rebounds. Expect a better performance against the Lakers on Thursday.

             He hit just 5-of-13 shots, but he played 30 minutes and closed this game next to Patty Mills. The Spurs are going to be really cautious with Danny Green (groin) and it's unclear how long Kawhi Leonard (shoulder) will be out, so Forbes does have some low-end value in very deep leagues. In 10 previous starts, Forbes averaged  9.8 points, 1.9 rebounds, 1.6 assists, 0.6 steals and 1.3 triples.

             He went back to the locker room in the fourth quarter and never returned, but maybe the Spurs were just being cautious. Parker did have a limp after the game and he said ""we'll see"" when asked if he would miss time. Dejounte Murray and Patty Mills will hold down the fort vs. the Lakers on Thursday if Parker can't go.

Aldridge's usage rate climbs from 22.0 to 29.6 when Kawhi Leonard (shoulder) is off the floor, so LMA will see a significant bump in value if Leonard's shoulder continues to sideline him. He hit 13-of-20 shots and 5-of-6 free throws with 12 rebounds, one assist and one block and has now scored 30+ points in back-to-back games for the second time this season.

             His six triples tied Manu Ginobili for the most triples by a Spur this season. He's been a consistent part of the rotation since the new year and has been tremendous with at least two triples in each of his last five games. He's averaging 14.2 points, 4.0 rebounds, 1.8 assists, 0.8 blocks and 3.0 triples in 27.0 minutes in that span, so he's trending up in a hurry. The Spurs are really banged up and rest their veterans a ton, so give Bertans a look if you need triples.

He really should be getting more MVP consideration for how good he's been.

             The rib injury is a question of pain tolerance for Drummond, but he looked great in heavy minutes during a very physical game tonight. Five of his boards came on the offensive glass, and the only negatives were four turnovers and an 0-of-2 mark at the FT line. He should be ready to go vs. the Nets on Wednesday, but owners should still confirm his status prior to tip-off.

             The Pistons didn't actually update Johnson's availability prior to tip-off, so owners in deep leagues were left guessing if he'd take the court. Reggie Bullock has established himself in the starting lineup, with Anthony Tolliver taking his spot when Detroit goes big, which leaves Johnson mopping up minutes with the second unit. It's not a promising situation for fantasy value.

             Even in a 28-point win, KAT still reached 30+ minutes because that's what coach Tom Thibodeau does. Minnesota has now held their last six opponents below 100 points, and Thibs gave KAT a lot of credit for their improvement. ""Defensively, he’s really starting to see things,"" Thibodeau said. ""He’s becoming more of a multiple-effort guy. The rebounding, that’s as good as it gets. Part of it is experience. He has a lot of pride, and he works at it."" His fantasy arrow is pointing straight up for the new year.

            Anthony Tolliver started the third quarter vs. New Orleans on Monday, making 1-of-4 shots to finish with two points and three rebounds in 26 minutes.
        
        
             Reggie Bullock shifted to the bench after halftime to counter the Pelicans' size up front, which made sense since Anthony Davis was torching them. Stanley Johnson (strained hip) was also out for this game but he's day-to-day, and his return will give coach Stan Van Gundy one more situational weapon to deploy. Tolliver is way too unreliable to roster in fantasy leagues.

             This was his third game of the season with at least 22 points, but he scored eight of his points in garbage time. This was a total blowout, so there's no need to read into this. At least he can tell his kids one day that he scored just as many points in a game as LeBron James (10), Isaiah Thomas (9) and Kevin Love (3) combined.

             Rondo came in averaging 18.5 minutes in the Pelicans' two previous games, and coach Alvin Gentry challenged him to be more aggressive at both ends tonight. He's not always fun to own, but elite assists make him worth the trouble in most formats -- among players outside the top-100 for roto value this season, Rondo is easily the leader with 8.0 assists per game. The only players close are Lonzo Ball (7.0), Elfrid Payton (6.6), J.J. Barea (6.0) and Jarrett Jack (6.0).

             Alvin Gentry said his team ""[wasn't] ready to play"" in a loss to the Wolves on Saturday, Anthony Davis felt the Pelicans ""weren't physical enough,"" and Darius Miller felt the Wolves ""played with more intensity."" They responded tonight with a bruising 68 points in the paint, while doubling up the Pistons in transition (30 points vs. 15 points), and Holiday had his fingerprints all over the game. He also came in shooting 54.1% over the past month, so we're not at all worried about tonight's misfires.

            The Cavaliers were embarrassed by the Wolves in a 127-99 loss on Monday with LeBron James scoring a season-low 10 points.
        
        
             LeBron was 4-of-8 from the field and 1-of-3 from the line with eight rebounds, five assists, two blocks, one triple and three turnovers. He was outplayed by Jimmy Butler all night and posted the worst +/- rating of his career (-39). He's been one of the most consistent players in the NBA for the past decade and this was just his 12th career game with 10 or fewer points, so expect him to respond in a big way on Thursday vs. Toronto.

             Cousins didn't score in the first quarter and he let his frustration boil over with a technical foul. That gives him eight technicals after the Pelicans' first 39 games, so he's on pace to flirt with the maximum 16-tech limit this regular season. Anthony Davis sprained his ankle late tonight and didn't return, leaving him questionable for Wednesday's game in Memphis -- if he can't suit up, Cousins should have an atmospheric usage rate.

             Moore played 35 minutes in a thrilling 112-109 win vs. the visiting Pistons tonight, and maybe he just needed to come home -- he began 2018 averaging 7.0 points on 35.7% shooting in a pair of away games. There are plenty of 3-point specialists in the league, but Moore stands out with his ability to score in other ways, while chipping in enough boards, assists and defensive stats to make up for off-shooting nights.

             The 23-year-old Dunn is in the midst of a breakout season, and he's surged into top-60 fantasy value over the past month. ""I’m more comfortable times 10 than last year,"" Dunn said recently. ""I didn’t know what I was doing last year. This year, I understand my role is learning how to be a leader every day."" He has a long leash for the rebuilding Bulls, and continues to make the most of it -- he was aggressive at both ends tonight, and even Zach LaVine's eventual return shouldn't slow him down.

             Nikola Mirotic (illness) was out tonight, which allowed Portis to earn more than his usual 18-24 minutes off the bench. That wasn't the only good news for his fantasy value on Monday, though, as Adrian Wojnarowski reported that Chicago ""still plans"" to trade Mirotic this season. Robin Lopez could also be on the block, and the departure of either veteran would open things up considerably for Portis. He's a solid hold in most formats.

             The Bulls' haul for Jimmy Butler looks a lot better with Markkanen thriving as a stretch-PF, and coach Fred Hoiberg has nothing but praise at the halfway point of the season. ""We wouldn’t trade [Markkanen] for anybody,"" Hoiberg said. ""He has great instincts. He has athleticism ... the ability to step up and take big shots ... We love him."" Fantasy owners will echo that sentiment, and he should only get better if Chicago manages to trade Nikola Mirotic before the deadline.

             The caveat here is that Chicago went small early and often, and they were up against a Houston team that's been hemorrhaging points to opponents lately. Valentine is holding steady as a late-round value, thanks to solid 3-pointers and a trickle of across-the-board value, but he and Justin Holiday (11 points in 40 minutes) are increasingly threatened by Zach LaVine's eventual return from ACL surgery.

            Cristiano Felicio was back in Chicago's rotation on Monday, posting four points (1-of-2 FGs, 2-of-2 FTs), three rebounds and one assist in just seven minutes.
        
        
             Nikola Mirotic (illness) was out and the Bulls don't have a ton of frontcourt depth, so they tabbed Felicio for backup C minutes tonight. He's spent most of the season in the G League, where he's averaging 20.5 points, 11.8 rebounds, 2.5 blocks, 2.3 assists and 2.0 steals. He's at least worth remembering in case Robin Lopez gets traded and Chicago doesn't bring in another big man.

             Lowry landed very hard on his backside during overtime on Monday, he needed help getting off the court, and he had X-rays after the game. The diagnosis of 'back spasms' could mean that the X-rays were negative, but we'll have to wait for more information. Fred VanVleet, Delon Wright and Norman Powell all stand to benefit if this costs Lowry any games.

             Curry has been battling left knee soreness lately, so it's not clear if this is related. He was back in the locker room for just a couple minutes before it was reported that he's probable to return, so it sounds like he dodged a bullet. We'll have an update after the game.

             The defensive stats and triples are what it makes him so valuable in category leagues -- he was a top-24 player in his previous six games with averages 11.8 points, 4.7 rebounds, 3.0 assists, 1.5 steals, 1.2 blocks and 1.0 triples. Kyle Lowry had to be carried off the floor with a potentially serious injury and the Raptors play three more games this week, so it makes a lot of sense to pick Wright up if he's available.

             His five blocks were his most since he had six back on April 2, 2017. Ibaka didn’t have it going offensively and missed a couple easy looks, but we’re not about to complain about this line. He’s been flirting with top-30 value in 9-category leagues over the past month and is showing some bounce that he didn’t have earlier in the season. He gets a matchup with the Heat on Wednesday.

             The Raptors went away from him in overtime in favor of a small-ball lineup with Serge Ibaka at center, but that has been a common theme this season. Valanciunas had 20 points, 13 rebounds, one block and an assist in just 17 minutes in his last game, but he had two duds earlier in January and is averaging just under 20 minutes per game this month. He's still an excellent per-minute fantasy contributor as evidenced by his last two games, so his owners just have to take the good with the bad.

             Green added three assists in 26 minutes tonight, helping the Rockets hold on for a road win in Chicago. He's still not contributing much beyond scoring and 3-pointers, though, which makes him very boom-or-bust -- it's all good when his shots are going in, but if he goes cold he'll be a fantasy liability. Plan accordingly.

             Yuck. Anderson shot 37.2 percent from the field in December, including 31.1 percent from deep, and he's fared no better in four January games. With mediocre rebounds and a near total lack of assists or defensive stats to bolster his value, he's hurting owners in the vast majority of leagues. Simply put, there should be better 3-point specialists on your waiver wire.

Houston won for just the fourth time in their past 11 games, and Gordon will be critical to any success they have in James Harden's absence. In the three games since Harden went down, the Rockets have four players with usage rates between 25-28 percent -- Gerald Green, Chris Paul, Clint Capela and Gordon. He's a high-upside option every night as a starter.

             He was just named the Eastern Conference Player of the Week and you'd be hard-pressed to find a hotter player since the new year. Derozan is averaging 35.5 points over his last four games, shooting a blistering 52.7 percent from the field in that span. Kyle Lowry hurt himself late in the game and had to be carried off by two teammates, so DeRozan may be asked to do even more going forward -- his usage rate climbs from 27.9 to 39.2 when Lowry is off the floor.

             The Nets will need Harris to play big minutes while DeMarre Carroll (knee) is out and he's definitely earned them lately.  ""He’s gaining confidence, getting better by the day,"" coach Kenny Atkinson said. ""We’re just so pleased with his progress. He’s been a big help."" He played 32 minutes in his last outing and is averaging 2.0 triples per game over his last six games, so he's a quality 3-point specialist to add if you missed out on a guy like Wayne Ellington.

             This was the 23rd game of his career with double-digit boards and he finished one rebound ahead of his previous career-high. The Nets are going to need him to play even heavier minutes going forward with DeMarre Carroll (knee) banged up, so his fantasy owners can expect a short-term bump in value. He has seventh-round value in 9-cat leagues and has plenty of room to grow.

             Ariza's usage rate hadn't budged without James Harden the past three games, at just 14.4%, so hopefully that starts to trend up. The minutes are there and he's contributing across-the-board stats without hurting you anywhere (tonight's FG% excluded), and he gets promising matchups vs. the Blazers and Suns to close out the week. As usual, he's fantastic in category-based leagues but drops a few notches in points-based leagues.

            Spencer Dinwiddie scored a career-high 31 points in Monday's 114-113 overtime loss to the Raptors, hitting 10-of-24 shots and 8-of-9 free throws with eight assists, five rebounds, two steals and three triples in 42 minutes.
        
        
             Similar to last game, Dinwiddie wasn't happy with the officiating down the stretch and said to the camera, ""that’s exactly what I was talking about."" Foul or no foul, Dinwiddie was special tonight and this performance comes a day after the Nets guaranteed his contract for the rest of the season -- he's also owed a non-guaranteed $1.6 million next season which makes him one of the best values in the league. With D'Angelo Russell (knee) back any day now, it's going to be exciting to see how those two mesh.

             There was some obvious rust with a couple airballs, but at least he had his normal explosion. He was supposed to have minute restrictions tonight, but he ended up playing 27 with the game going to overtime. LeVert was averaging 16.3 points, 8.3 assists and 5.3 rebounds, 1.3 steals and 1.5 triples in his previous four games before the injury, so his owners should forget about this dud and expect a better performance in his next outing.

             Crabbe made a game-tying layup to send this one to overtime, but he injured himself by landing awkwardly on his left leg. He injured his shin but said after the game that he's confident he'll play on Wednesday -- we'll add him to the injury report as a precaution. Crabbe was hitting 2.3 treys per game prior to this outburst, but his rough field goal percentage (37.7%) and lack of steals (0.7) is really holding him back in category leagues.

             Lowry landed really hard on his back, and when he tried to get up he was only able to take three steps before falling to the ground again. He attempted to stand a second time, but he wasn't able to and that's when his teammates stepped in and carried him to the locker room. He was in a lot of pain and we'll be watching closely for an update. If he misses time, Delon Wright and Fred VanVleet will soak up all the point guard minutes.

X-rays came back negative but the Pelicans ruled him out very quickly. They are always super cautious with Davis, so he may undergo additional testing. We'll likely have to wait until the post-game interviews before we get another update. Coach Alvin Gentry doesn't seem to trust Cheick Diallo, so there are no speculative pickups for now.

             He's going to have restrictions, but it's not clear exactly how many minutes he will be limited to. He's worth picking up if you need a center as he averaged 11.1 points, 7.8 boards and 0.9 blocks per game before the injury, but you will need to be patient with him early on. Once he has his legs under him, we'd expect Dedmon and John Collins to get the bulk of the center minutes going forward.

             The Pacers recently waived Damien Wilkins, who started in Bogdanovic's absence on Saturday, which was a clear sign that Bojan's injury wasn't serious. The 28-year-old swingman remains a borderline value in most 12-team formats -- he's probably not worth owning in points leagues, but is a decent source of 3-pointers and percentages in category-based leagues.

As long as he's this hot offensively, though, he's worth plugging into your lineups.

            Myles Turner chipped in 15 points (7-of-10 FGs, 1-of-4 FTs), six rebounds, three blocks, two steals and one assist in a winning effort vs. the visiting Bucks on Monday.
        
        
             Indiana was phenomenal to start the game and had a 21-point lead after one quarter. Turner was a big part of that, especially on defense -- he was on pace for a huge fantasy line but only played 24 minutes due to the lopsided score. Victor Oladipo's return has rejuvenated the Pacers at both ends of the court, and Myles should quickly regain his footing as a top-50 value with rest-of-season upside.

             Thaddeus Young deserves credit for not allowing Giannis to get the ball in his comfort zones early in the game, but this was just a fluky off night for the Bucks. Antetokounmpo has been one of the most consistent elite players in the NBA this season, and even in a 'bad' game he still contributed across the board. We expect him to come out firing vs. Orlando's suspect defense on Wednesday.

             The Bucks scraped up a season-low 38 points in the first half tonight, and headed into the locker room trailing by 26 points. The fourth quarter was garbage time and coach Jason Kidd rested most of his starters, so there's no cause for concern here -- Middleton even knocked down a pair of 3-pointers with one steal to satisfy most owners.

             Maker began the New Year with a streak of three solid games, averaging 12.7 points, 1.7 triples, 5.3 rebounds and 1.7 blocks in that span. He's predictably fallen off since, though, and his role tends to fluctuate based on the flow of the game and Jason Kidd's whims. Most of his production came in garbage time tonight and if you want reliable value, look elsewhere.

             He landed really awkwardly on his right ankle, but he did shoot his free throws before limping to the locker room. This is a really close game heading into the fourth quarter, so whether or not he returns will say a lot about the severity. We'll have an update shortly.

             Brogdon gives the Bucks a different look than Tony Snell (six points in 29 minutes), including more dynamic offense. There's no guarantee that Brogdon will keep the job, and it doesn't help that Milwaukee was blown out in Indiana tonight, but he was the only starter to earn minutes in the fourth quarter. Brogdon's stats are up in almost every category as a starter this season, though, so owners are certainly hoping he can fend off Snell.

             The Cavs were getting blown out and Thomas let his frustration get the best out of him -- he basically slapped Andrew Wiggins in the face. He wasn't playing well before the ejection and had just two points on 0-of-7 shooting in the first half, finishing with nine points (3-of-11 FGs), three assists, one triple and one rebound in 19 minutes. The Cavaliers have a back-to-back set coming up on Thursday and Friday, but it's unclear which one he will sit out to rest.

Shabazz Napier will get another start on Tuesday night, and with averages of 18.2 points, 5.4 dimes, 1.8 triples, 2.0 steals and 2.4 turnovers per game as a starter this season, he's someone to think about grabbing if you've got someone to cut.

             Johnson has spent the past four games on the sidelines with the hip issue, which has translated to more minutes for Reggie Bullock and Luke Kennard. It'll be more of the same if Johnson can't give it a go tonight.

             Mirotic skipped shootaround and was listed as doubtful, so it's not surprising at all to see him hit the sidelines. Lauri Markkanen and Bobby Portis will split most of Mirotic's minutes tonight, with Markkanen offering the most upside. The Bulls play again on Wednesday in New York and for now, we'll be considering Mirotic questionable for that one.RotoGrinders.com Daily Slant: If Bobby Portis is able to see his minutes climb into the high-20s this evening as a high-usage bench option, he's going to be a really strong DFS dollar per point play industry wide. With Mirotic and all inactive Bulls off the floor this year, Portis owns a 24.7% usage rate and 1.18 FPPM mark.

             ""We think he just sprained his knee a bit. He had an MRI [Monday], and we’re just waiting for the MRI results,"" a source of the NY Post said. ""So far he’s responded well. We think it’s just a sprain. There’s a little discomfort he has to work through and get that swelling down."" We'd like to see the results of that MRI before making any proclamations about his injured right knee, but a sprain would certainly be good news considering this is the same knee that caused him to miss over 50 games two years ago. With Carroll unavailable on Monday, Joe Harris will likely get the start.

            The Knicks have reportedly engaged in serious talks with Trey Burke on a deal.
        
        
             The club could come to terms with Burke on a deal by this weekend, and it'll be interesting to see who they cut in order to free up a roster spot. Ramon Sessions has fallen out of the rotation, so he could be an option. Burke isn't likely to have much value at all in New York.

Favors was able to get through portions of Monday's practice, and with another full day off until Wednesday's game, he should be fine.

With Roberson on the shelf, Terrance Ferguson should be looking at a few more starts, but Ferguson isn't much more than a low-end streamer in deep leagues.

The Dubs play against on Wednesday vs. the Clippers, and for now, we'll be considering Durant questionable for that one.

             He's still away from the team with his wife due to give birth to their child any day now, and with him out, there will be more minutes for De'Aaron Fox, Buddy Hield and Bogdan Bogdanovic. Hill hasn't been very good this season in Sacramento, and DNP-CDs could be a common occurrence for him over the final few months of the year, so he's not a must-own guy by any means.

Bryn Forbes and Brandon Paul will have the opportunity for some extended minutes sans Ginobili, with Forbes offering a bit more upside. Ginobili will be back in action on Thursday, but he's been too inconsistent this season to warrant ownership in most leagues.

Kyle Anderson will get another start tonight, and with both Danny Green (groin) and Rudy Gay (heel) joining Leonard on the sidelines, Anderson should be able to flirt with minutes in the mid-30s.

             This will be Green's fourth straight game on the sidelines and with all these guys unavailable, Bryn Forbes and Kyle Anderson could be forced into heavy minutes tonight, making them reasonable DFS targets with a favorable matchup in Sacramento. We haven't received another update on Green since Gregg Popovich's ominous quote suggesting he could be shut down for ""a while,"" and with just late-round value on the year, he's not really worth rostering through this injury in most formats.

If Porter can't go after a couple days of rest, Kelly Oubre will draw another start and will be a solid punt in DFS and streaming option in standard leagues.

            ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski said the Grizzlies want a first-round pick in return for Tyreke Evans.
        
        
             Evans is having his best season since his rookie year, but Wojnarowski adds that the Grizzlies are unlikely to get a first-round pick. He has an expiring contract and a lot of red flags because of his troublesome knee, but it makes sense for Memphis to at least shop him around before he hits free agency this summer.

            ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski reported on Monday morning that the Bulls are ""still planning"" to trade Nikola Mirotic.
        
        
             He's eligible to be traded on Jan. 15, so the Bulls will have a few weeks to move him before the Feb. 8 deadline. Wojnarowski mentioned the Jazz as a potential suitor, and that may not be a bad landing spot for him because it's no secret that Derrick Favors and Rudy Gobert aren't an ideal frontcourt pairing in today's NBA. If the Bulls do move Mirotic, Lauri Markkanen will have a higher fantasy floor and Bobby Portis would see a bump in minutes.

             Johnson is still considered questionable to play vs. the Pelicans and has missed the last four games. Reggie Bullock has leapfrogged him in the rotation, so he has very little appeal in fantasy hoops.

The Nets play tonight, so maybe coach Kenny Atkinson will drop a target date. Russell will likely have restrictions early on, but he'll have early-round upside once he's back up to full strength.

             Drummond went through shootaround and is on track to start on Monday barring a setback in warmups. Assuming Drummond plays, Boban Marjanovic and Eric Moreland will lose pretty much all of their streaming appeal. Drummond is a bit risky in DFS because this is an injury that is easy to aggravate like we saw on Friday, but season-long owners can pencil him into lineups.

             With the Hawks rebuilding, they are ""pushing"" to unload veterans in exchange for draft picks and young assets. Bazemore is owed $18.1 million in 2018-19 with a player option worth $18.1 million in 2019-20, but the Hawks may be able to find a home for him with so many teams in need of wing depth. A move would likely be a bad thing for Bazemore, as he doesn't have much competition in Atlanta and is having a career year with 12.4 points, 4.3 rebounds, 3.8 assists, 1.8 steals, 0.7 blocks and 1.6 triples.

We'll be on the lookout for any word on restrictions, but there's a good chance he sees his normal allotment of minutes. He was on fire before the injury and shouldn't be sitting on the waiver wire, especially with four games on the schedule this week.

             Wojnarowski previously reported that the Lakers would prefer to wait until the end of the season, but that doesn't seem to be the case any more. The Lakers are trying to shed salary for the free agent market in 2018 and have given up hope of trying to move Luol Deng's laughable contract, so Clarkson, Julius Randle and even Larry Nance could be moved. Clarkson is only averaging 23.1 minutes per game for the Lakers, so a change of scenery could be a good thing.

             It's not clear when they tried to acquire him or if they still are, but it sounds like the Pistons wanted to include Reggie Jackson (ankle) in any deal -- his injury could be a reason why the talks stalled. The Pistons could certainly use an upgrade on the wings and Fournier fits the bill as a scorer and playmaker, and he should be available with the Magic looking at another lost season. He'll be a name to watch as we approach the Feb. 8 deadline, but his value would likely take a hit if he joins a playoff-bound team.

             Jordan is fully expected to decline the player option on his $24.1 million contract for the 2018-19 season, and Wojnarowski adds that most teams believe he will be willing to re-sign with the team that trades for him -- that helps his market value because teams wouldn't just view him as a half-season rental. Milwaukee has been ""determined to find a center,"" but it remains to be seen if they have the assets to make an appealing package. The Clippers aren't set on trading Jordan at all costs according to Wojnarowski, but expect plenty of trade talk leading up to the Feb. 8 deadline.

Jackson had 17 points, 10 rebounds, five assists, three 3-pointers, one block and zero turnovers in 31 minutes on Sunday,  becoming the first Suns rookie to have at least 10 points, 10 rebounds and five assists in a game since Joe Johnson in 2002. The bad news is that the Suns have a total of four games over the next two weeks, so it's not a great time to pick him up if you need production.

I’ll probably miss my first five shots because I’ll be shooting the ball too hard and I’ll probably pick up three fouls quick."" Williams had surgery back on September 25 with a six-month timetable, so it sounds like he might be a bit ahead of schedule. He averaged 11.4 points, 9.1 rebounds, 0.8 blocks and 0.8 steals after the All-Star break last season, so he could become a waiver-wire pickup later in the campaign.

He's now played 17+ minutes in four straight games, so owners in very deep leagues should keep an eye on him to see if his role keep growing.

The league's coaches have rallied around Walton, but ultimately winning is the best response to critics -- the Lakers took this game 132-113, and Walton even joked about the episode to reporters after the game (see link below). Drama aside, Lonzo looks safe as a mid-round fantasy value who only rises higher if you ignore his percentages.

Kuzma shot 6-of-12 from the field and 2-of-3 from the line, but it's worth noting that the Lakers tied their season-high with 132 points tonight, so double-digit scoring lines weren't hard to come by. His value is depleted with the Lakers' frontcourt at full strength, but Kuzma's owners still have plenty of cause for optimism.

The good news is that his defense basically guarantees his role is safe going forward.

            Taurean Prince dislocated his right ring finger during Sunday's game, but returned to finish with six points (2-of-7 FGs, 2-of-2 FTs), seven rebounds and two assists in 25 minutes.
        
        
             Prince hurt himself while battling Julius Randle for a rebound, and the taped-up finger appeared to nag him for the rest of the game. He shouldn't miss any time, fortunately, but owners should still check back for updates after Monday's shootaround.

             Collins took a shot to the mouth and was treated by the team's trainers in the first half, but he soon returned and it shouldn't cost him any time. He made 5-of-7 field goals and 4-of-5 free throw tonight, and even hit the first 3-pointer of his NBA career -- he attempted two of them on Friday, so maybe the Hawks' coaching staff is encouraging him to extend his range. It's something to watch as we approach the halfway-point in Atlanta's season.

             Schroder continues to thrive when he attacks the basket, and his 10.2 points off drives this season ranks second in the NBA behind only James Harden (11.5). He settled for too many outside jumpers tonight, but it was the other end of the court that cost the Hawks -- they were out-scored 56-40 in the paint, and gave up 42 points in transition. Defensive issues aside, Schroder should have another big game vs. the short-handed Clippers on Monday.

             It was reported on Dec. 27 that the Hawks hoped to have Dewayne Dedmon (leg) back in 10-14 days, but we're on Day 11 and have yet to hear about him practicing. Even as the default starting center, though, Plumlee has unimpressive averages of 5.4 points, 4.4 rebounds, 1.1 assists, 0.6 steals and 0.6 blocks. If those numbers wouldn't help you, continue to ignore him.

""It's been tough for Patty,"" Gregg Popovich admitted recently. ""He's been all over the place. He's trying to help us any way he can. It has hurt his numbers a little bit."" Mills isn't even holding top-150 value in 9-cat leagues this season, and belongs on the wire in the bulk of fantasy leagues.

             The 40-year-old Ginobili is setting records on a nightly basis. On Friday, he became the oldest player in NBA history to score 20+ points in fewer than 20 minutes. Tonight, he became the oldest player to score 20+ points in back-to-back games, in addition to becoming the seventh player in NBA history with 8,000 career points off the bench. Fantasy-wise, though, he's still a sporadic value due to limited minutes and random DNP-CDs.

This was the first game of a back-to-back set, however, and based on Pau's workload he could get a rest day vs. the Kings on Monday. With luck, the Spurs will clarify which veterans might be rested after shootaround.

             Aldridge added one assist, one steal, one block and one 3-pointer without any turnovers tonight, but he bricked a potential game-winner in Portland. The Spurs held him out of Friday's game as a precaution and sporadic DNPs will be an annoyance for his owners down the stretch, especially during busy parts of the schedule -- they play the second of back-to-back games on Monday, so it can't hurt to confirm the status of guys like Aldridge and Pau Gasol prior to tip-off.

It's been below average most of the season."" They had a modest 19 assists tonight, on 48 made field goals, but that's partly because Damian Lillard (calf) was absent. McCollum would be leaned on more for playmaking if Dame were out long-term, but there's a good chance he'll return vs. OKC on Tuesday.

The Thunder rank 29th in bench scoring, ahead of only the Thunder, and Patterson belongs on the waiver wire while Paul George, Carmelo Anthony and Steven Adams are all healthy.

            Russell Westbrook triple-doubled in a losing effort on Sunday with 26 points, 11 assists and 10 rebounds in 34 minutes vs. the Suns.
        
        
             Westbrook hit 11-of-21 field goals but he was 3-of-7 from the FT line, while committing six turnovers. The poor FT shooting is an ongoing concern. Fantasy owners expected brutal turnovers (4.5 per game) and FG percentages (43.2% on 21.2 attempts), but Westbrook has also plummetted from a career-high 84.5% FT shooting last season to a career-low 71.8% this season. An upward correction seems inevitable, so roto owners should hang in there.

             Andre Roberson is still nursing a sore knee, while Alex Abrines (groin) was eased into the mix with just three minutes tonight. OKC coach Billy Donovan praised Ferguson for staying focused despite a rough shooting night on Thursday, saying, ""He kept guarding, he kept playing and he kept doing the things that you need him to do."" That's a solid vote of confidence, but he could easily fall out of the rotation once Abrines is up to speed and Roberson is healthy.

             The Thunder went 12-5 during a busy month of December, and they've appreciated the slower pace in January.  ""We can exhale a little bit, get a couple days of practice, fine tune some things, get our bodies right and get our minds right,"" said Melo. He's accepted his role as a spot-up shooter in OKC, and it had been paying dividends -- he came in averaging 21.3 points on 58.5% shooting in the past three games. He'll get three games next week, beginning Tuesday vs. the visiting Trail Blazers.

This could have been a simple precaution to avoid aggravating Abrines' groin injury, but even at full strength he's not worth a roster spot in fantasy leagues.

Inefficiency has dogged him all year, but over the past three games he's averaging 14.0 points on 48.6% shooting -- we're not sold yet, but he's worth watching closely on a rebuilding Suns team.

Chriss should be re-evaluated in the next few days and the Suns only play twice this week, which reduces the incentive to speculatively pick up Bender. Most owners should just keep an eye on the Suns' injury report, but it can't hurt to add him if there's a guy you've been itching to cut. Let's see him reproduce this gem before getting too excited.

            Dwight Powell was quiet in 14 minutes off the Mavs bench on Sunday, scoring two points with four rebounds and one assist.
        
        
             The Mavs are 0-3 during their current four-game homestand, leaving them just 0.5 games away from the the worst record in the West -- an ignominious spot currently held by the Lakers. Powell had been a bright spot recently, helping fantasy owners as a terrific source of FG percentages with some rebounds and defensive stats, so we're expecting a bounce-back effort vs. the Magic on Tuesday.

             Mavs coach Rick Carlisle blasted his team's defensive effort after giving up 127 points to the Bulls on Friday, saying, ""The starters were abysmal to start the game and our second unit was abysmal to start the fourth."" They did better on that end tonight, but were mauled on the glass 59-40, with Mejri's seven rebounds tying Harrison Barnes for a team-high. Tonight's efforts could earn him more run, but he's an unlikely fantasy asset while Dirk Nowitzki is healthy.

             Dirk couldn't find the range tonight and he went 0-of-3 from downtown in his 23 minutes. We'll give him a pass, though, as he came in averaging a solid 14.7 points on 55.9% shooting in his previous three games, with 1.3 triples, 5.0 boards, 1.3 assists and 0.7 steals. Most importantly, he has zero DNPs this season and seems determined to play 82 games at age 39.

             After Kris Dunn torched the Mavs on Friday, coach Rick Carlisle said, ""They're picking on Dennis. They're going at him."" The stats back up Carlisle's assertion -- Smith is allowing players to shoot 4.1% higher than their season average when he's defending them, which is 10th-highest among players with at least 10 possessions defended per game. The Mavericks nearly erased a 13-point deficit while he was benched down the stretch tonight, but this is unlikely to become a trend -- he should bounce back vs. Orlando on Tuesday.

He's scored double-digit points just once in the past 11 games, and during that span he's added a mere 0.4 triples, 3.8 rebounds, 1.0 assists, 0.9 blocks and 0.5 steals. There are more promising rest-of-season free agents on the majority of waiver wires.

             In case you missed it, Jack's contract will be guaranteed for the rest of the season. Ramon Sessions has fallen out of the rotation, so Jack continues to start and play minutes in the mid- to high-20s while Frank Ntilikina develops in a backup role. New York could turn Ntilikina loose eventually, though, so we don't recommend relying on Jack for rest-of-season value.

That part of him being aggressive [offensively] ...That’s the part I have to explore in my game."" The Knicks' rookie is averaging just 5.8 points per game, and more aggression would be welcome if it results in attempts at the rim -- he's shooting 45.9% in the restricted area, but just 28.7% everywhere else.

             Iguodala is dealing with soreness in both his left knee and hip, and he's had a few games off throughout the season, but it helps that this isn't a back-to-back situation. Check back after Monday's shootaround for the latest.

             Green recently dealt with a sprained left ankle, and he's had back and shoulder issues this season, but none of them have been overly serious. The Warriors are playing it safe with injuries and the fact that Dray is 'probable' suggests he won't miss any time. Check for confirmation after Monday's shootaround.

             Steph's knee sure didn't limit him on Saturday, when he dropped 45 points on the Clippers. This isn't related to the right ankle injury that cost him multiple weeks, so presumably he'll be fine, but we'll know more after Golden State's shootaround on Monday.

He'll get another day to rest before Tuesday's road game in OKC, and we'll consider him questionable for that one. In the meantime, expect Shabazz Napier to play big minutes as a starter with C.J. McCollum soaking up more touches offensively.

             ""I don’t know [when Kawhi will return],"" Pop said. ""It depends on how his shoulder goes."" The partial tear implies more than a Grade-1 strain, but we'll reserve judgment until the Spurs provide details -- he hasn't even been officially ruled out for Monday's game, which is encouraging. Danny Green (groin) and Rudy Gay (heel) are also nursing injuries, which temporarily shifts a big workload onto guys like Kyle Anderson and Bryn Forbes.

             Johnson made 6-of-12 field goals without any defensive stats tonight, and it didn't take him long to recover from Friday's 0-of-7 shooting dud. His recent ankle bursitis appears to be a non-issue, and his role is very safe with Miami running a tight rotation -- they went nine deep tonight, but two of those logged under 13 minutes. Johnson is safe to deploy in nearly any scoring format.

             Whiteside did a nice job early on of locking down the paint, sending away three shots through the first six minutes of action, although he was a bit passive on offense and was again benched down the stretch. Part of that had to do with the Jazz closing out the game with a small-ball lineup, but Whiteside's energy level also wasn't great during the second half of action. Still, it shouldn't only be a matter of time until Whiteside is cranking out monster stat lines again, so there's a nice buy-low opportunity here.

With Dion Waiters (ankle) not expected back anytime soon, Johnson should continue to start while seeing more opportunity on offense, so he's worth owning in most leagues.

             Ellington has been lights out from beyond the arc this year, draining an elite 2.9 triples per contest on 41.7% shooting from distance, which has him ranking in the top-8 in that category this season. Head coach Erik Spoelstra has seriously suggested that he wants Ellington to launch 20 triples a night, so he clearly has the greenest of the green lights to jack up the long ball. Give him a look if you need a boost in 3-point shooting.

            Josh Richardson had a game-winning layup on Sunday, finishing with 14 points, three boards, seven dimes, two steals, two blocks and one turnover in 37 minutes.
        
        
             Richardson did a nice job of finding open teammates on the pick-and-roll, and as per usual, he was phenomenal on the defensive end. Head coach Erik Spoelstra had some nice words for J-Rich after the game, saying: ""He's ready for the next jump and the jump is ready for him. The question is, when?"" Maybe now? After a slow start to the year, Richardson has been churning out top-20 value over the past month, and he's showing no signs of slowing down.

            Goran Dragic scored 16 points on 6-of-18 shooting Sunday, to go with one 3-pointer, three rebounds, six assists, one steal and three turnovers in 34 minutes.
        
        
             Dragic started very slow in this one as he fell victim to some suffocating Utah defense, but he did a nice job of turning things around after halftime, scoring 14 of his 16 points through the second half of action. He’s been trending up over the past four with averages of 21.0 points, 8.3 dimes, 4.5 boards, 2.3 triples and 3.3 turnovers per game on 44.2% shooting, which has been good enough for mid-round value in 9-cat leagues. If you've been looking for a good time to try and flip Dragic, now would be that moment.

            Rodney Hood went 7-of-16 from the field and 2-of-3 from the line on his way to 17 points, one 3-pointer, four rebounds and two assists in 30 minutes off the bench.
        
        
             Hood got cookin' late in the game, scoring nine of his 17 points through the final frame of action, although overall, this was a fairly empty stat line. Hood has been putting points on the board this season, but he's not bringing much else to the stat sheet, and lame shooting percentages have really weighed down his value. He's not necessarily a must-own guy anymore.

            Derrick Favors posted an 11-point, 10-rebound double-double on Sunday, to go with one steal, one block and one turnover in 32 minutes.
        
        
             Favors did briefly exit the game after Goran Dragic hit him with a knee-to-knee collision on a drive to the hoop, but he didn't need to go to the locker room and after taking a few possessions off, he got right back in there. This could be something that swells up on Favors overnight, but with Utah off until Wednesday, it might not be something that requires him to spend any time on the sidelines. We'll have a better idea on his status for Wednesday's game based on his activity level at practice.

             Sefolosha was a perfect 4-of-4 from the field, 1-of-1 from distance and 4-of-4 from the stripe, giving him a remarkable 112.8 true shooting percentage on the evening. He’s played well as a starter this season, posting averages of 10.6 points, 8.0 boards, 3.0 steals and 0.6 swats per contest, so he’s on the radar as a potential steals-specialist in deep leagues.

            Joe Ingles did a little bit of everything on Sunday, scoring nine points on 3-of-8 shooting to go with eight boards, three 3-pointers, one assist, one steal, one block and three turnovers in 32 minutes.
        
        
             Ingles went through a bit of a cold stretch through the month of December, but he’s gotten things back on track in January with averages of 8.7 points, 2.0 triples, 6.0 boards, 5.0 dimes, 1.3 steals and 2.7 turnovers per contest on 45.5% shooting, which has been good enough for top-100 value in 9-cat leagues. The scoring comes and goes with Ingles, but his ability to chip in across-the-board stats without hurting you in any one area makes him worth owning in most leagues.

             Miami bothered Mitchell with their length and did an excellent job of keeping him out of the paint through the first half of action, but Mitchell came out firing after halftime, opening the second half with 11 straight points. He also did an excellent job of making life difficult for Goran Dragic on defense, and he was yet again on the receiving end of an impressive alley-oop jam (link below). He's been flirting with top-30 value for a month now, giving him the edge in the ROY conversation.

             With so many people capable of initiating the offense in Utah, Rubio just hasn’t had the ball in his hands as much this season, and that’s a trend that unlikely to change anytime soon. Donovan Mitchell also tends to be the point guard on the floor during crunch time, which has negatively impacted Rubio’s minutes. He did do a nice job of setting up his teammates in this one, but it's tough to ignore the fact that he missed all his shots and failed to bring any defensive stats to the table.

""I'm regaining strength. The shoulder is healed. Range of motion is getting better. I'm starting to do stuff on the court, getting into basketball shape."" Until Houston provides more details, we'll consider him out indefinitely.

If you've been holding Canaan as a low-end option, this is your cue to cut him in standard leagues.

Jawun Evans drew the start in his place on Saturday, but finished with just four points, three boards, four assists and one steal in 23 minutes, so he's not a great target in most leagues despite the increased workload. Lou Williams is going to be very busy on Monday, particularly if Blake Griffin (concussion) is out.

            Michael Beasley (ankle) will not suit up for Sunday's game against the Mavericks.
        
        
             Beasley tweaked his ankle during Friday's loss to Miami, and while he was initially able to play through it, it sounds like swelling will keep him on the sidelines tonight. After today, the Knicks don't play again until Wednesday against the Bulls, so perhaps Beasley will be able to get back out there after having a full four days off. With him unavailable tonight, Doug McDermott and Lance Thomas will likely pick up most of his minutes.

             This will be Canaan's second straight game on the sidelines, which should translate to more minutes for Tyler Ulis. The Suns don't play again until Friday against the Rockets, so perhaps he'll be able to get back out there for that one. As a side note, Phoenix guaranteed Canaan's contract for the rest of the season on Sunday, so he'll finish the 2016-17 season with the Suns.

             Carroll suffered the knee injury during the final play of Saturday's loss to the Celtics, and given his history of knee issues, it wouldn't be surprising to see him spend more than a few games on the sidelines here. Joe Harris will likely return to the starting five with Carroll out, and there will be more minutes available for Nik Stauskas and Allen Crabbe. Carroll's numbers have been trending in the wrong direction for a month now, so he's not really worth hanging onto through this injury.

LeVert was playing very well prior to going down, so he should be owned in most leagues.

             Leonard suffered the shoulder injury during Friday's win over Phoenix, and it is indeed a real injury, so him sitting out Sunday's game should not be viewed as a precautionary move. The team will be monitoring him over the coming days, with the hopes that he'll be able to get back out there for Thursday's game against the Lakers, but it wouldn't be surprising to see him sit on Monday. Kyle Anderson will be starting in his absence, while LaMarcus Aldridge will see an uptick in usage.

His original timetable had him returning around mid-January, so if he's ahead of schedule then he could be back any day now. He'll be eased into the rotation very slowly and he'll have to compete with Lance Stephenson for minutes behind Victor Oladipo and Bojan Bogdanovic, so he doesn't have much stash appeal at the moment.

            Nene (right knee contusion) is listed as out in the game notes for Monday's game vs. the Bulls.
        
        
             This will be his third game in a row on the shelf as the Rockets continue to play it safe with the veteran. He's averaging under 15 minutes in 27 appearances this season and has little to no fantasy value. Tarik Black and Clint Capela will get a small bump with Nene out.

             Drummond played through his sore ribs on Friday vs. the 76ers, but he re-aggravated the injury and was held out on Saturday vs. Houston. It's unclear if the Pistons will practice on Sunday, but the latest his owners can expect an update is after the Monday morning shootaround. With the Pelicans starting Anthony Davis and DeMarcus Cousins, Eric Moreland and Boban Marjanovic should both get some run if Drummond can't go.

             He doesn't have a timetable and is getting a second opinion on his troublesome ankle. Waiters previously said he was going to wait until the offseason to have surgery, but maybe he changes his stance. We'll provide an update when we know more, but he's just a low-end stash in category leagues. Josh Richardson, Tyler Johnson and Wayne Ellington will continue to soak up the bulk of the wing minutes.

             Winslow was able to do some non-contact drills this week, but he's still considered week-to-week and there's no report of a target date. James Johnson and Kelly Olynyk are locked into significant roles, so Winslow doesn't have much stash appeal.

             The Knicks would prefer to keep the 23-year-old center and move Kyle O'Quinn, and Berman adds that they would only consider moving Hernangomez if they got a prime talent in return. Moving him now would be selling low, as he's been stuck behind Enes Kanter and O'Quinn all season. He's nothing more than a stash until his situation changes.

Dinwiddie is also on the books for a non-guaranteed $1.6 million next season, making him one of the best values in the NBA. He's been excellent as the fill-in starter for D'Angelo Russell and it's going to be interesting to see how he fits next to Russell when he returns this month. Nets coach Kenny Atkinson wouldn't rule out starting them together, so Dinwiddie's outlook is still promising.

             This is kind of what a lot of Hield fantasy owners didn't want to see. He's been a letdown recently, but this line shows some promise with big minutes and decent usage. In other words, it would have been better to have him be terrible and just cut, or be good and feel good about keeping him. Hield does have four games next week, but he's kind of on thin ice in standard leagues for so many empty stat lines. Chances are nobody is going to use their waiver if you drop Hield in most leagues.

             He did a fine job in the first unit and even attempted seven shots, making three of those. Richardson is still buried on the depth chart when the Kings are healthy, so he's not a strong hold in even very deep leagues.

             The Kings won by eight points against the visiting Nuggets, but it had nothing to do with Temple. He was an awful 1-of-9 from the field, including 0-of-3 from behind the 3-point line, while turning it over four times while posting a minus-21 rating, one of just two Sacramento players with a negative rating. Head coach Dave Joerger occasionally plugs Temple into the starting five, but even then Temple only has fantasy appeal in the deepest of leagues.

             The 40-year-old continues to be an important part of Dave Joerger's rotation, as he finds time to use the ageless veteran at the expense of some of his younger players. However, nagging injuries and erratic playing time, as well as the fact he is 40, makes Vinsanity a rather inconsistent fantasy option. He is only worth using in deeper leagues.

             The Kings have one of the most unstable rotations in the NBA, where a player can go from a must-start fantasy option to a cut candidate within the same week. Head coach Dave Joerger's rotation is maddening to fantasy owners. Fox is averaging 17.5 points, 5.5 assists and 3.0 rebounds in two games since returning from a six-game absence due to a quadriceps injury.

             Cauley-Stein was also a very efficient 8-of-12 from the field, although he was just 1-of-3 from the charity stripe. It was a nice bounce-back game after he laid an egg last time out against the Hornets. He now has 17 or more points in five of his past seven outings, making him one of the safest fantasy options in Sacramento at the moment.

Additionally, maybe coach Mike Malone starts him to help out Jokic because that duo has a +9.3 net rating together this season. Lyles has been a top-45 player per game over his last 14, so he needs to be owned in standard leagues.

             Labissiere was humming right along, especially on the defensive end, and he posted a plus-15 rating. He had no personal fouls, so his minutes were held down because of head coach Dave Joerger. The coach used a nine-player rotation, and three bench players had more minutes than three starters. It's always a hard situation to figure for fantasy owners.

That aside, his two blocks were emphatic with one on a cutting Garrett Temple to put him to the ground, and the other on Bogdan Bogdanovic in transition. On top of just not being a scorer anymore, coach Mike Malone is using a lot more ways to get Murray the ball as he's even drawn up some designed plays like elevator screens to get him open threes.

             The slump continues and this back-to-back was a rough one following his 3-of-13 shooting line on Friday. The Joker has really struggled to get free and his post scoring has disappeared. His jumper just isn't falling right now and he's taking more of them late in the clock, as well. We've seen Jokic go through some shooting slumps before and this one will probably be on Mike Malone to come up with some new stuff for him. There's little reason to worry about Jokic and maybe you can buy low on him.

             After his 25-23 line on Friday, KAT is in beast mode right now. Last season he really started to heat up when the calendar turned to 2017, so maybe we're in for a repeat in 2018. Towns also had a right knee issue after he landed hard on it, but he was able to return to the game after getting a quick massage. His durability continues to be his best asset, and that's part of the reason he's yielded the most value of any player in nine-cat leagues since Dec. 1 -- the Wolves playing more games helps. Anyone who took KAT with the first pick should have no regrets.

             He basically only had one bad game in three weeks with that 14-point dud on Friday.

             He usually plays well against the Pelicans and he brought it again. DeMarcus Cousins did fall on Dieng's right arm to cause some pain, but Dieng stayed in the game. He's been able to earn more minutes next to Karl-Anthony Towns, which puts him on the map as a hold in standard leagues.

             The points and rebounds were nice, but he hit 7-of-19 from the field while posting four turnovers and a minus-9 rating, worst among the starting five. He now has 20 or more points in a season-best seven consecutive games, and his streak of six straight games with at least one 3-pointer is the second longest of his season. He continues to produce a top-40 clip.

             The 16-16 line was impressive, and it masks the ugly 5-of-19 shooting night for Wall. He also turned it over six times, but fantasy owners cannot complain too vehemently. He saw his shot wasn't working, so he started to distribute more to guys who were able to make buckets. Wall has nine or more assists in four straight, and seven of the past eight outings.

             He did have a minor ankle tweak in the fourth quarter, but he looked fine after only about 10 seconds of hobbling. Cousins really has to get his turnovers under control and he's leading the NBA in that department. Besides that, he continues to be one of the best stat-sheet stuffers in the NBA.

             Oubre was making the start with Otto Porter Jr. (hip, back) on the shelf, but the forward's injury doesn't sound terribly serious. It should be a short period for Oubre in the starting lineup before heading back to the bench. Still, Oubre has some short-term fantasy appeal in standard play, and he isn't a bad low-priced DFS option as long as he is in the starting five.

             It's his third-lowest scoring game of the season for the Brow, but credit to the Wolves for keeping him below his season scoring average in all three of his games against them -- he got hurt in one of them. Davis was on fire with 29-plus points in each of his last four, so just give coach Tom Thibodeau some credit on this one and expect monster lines in his next handful of outings. He'll get Detroit on Monday, which is a team he dropped 59 and 20 on back in 2015-16.

             There's something about 2018 that agrees with Morris, as he has averaged 12.3 points and 12.7 rebounds in three outings in the month of January while hitting 16-of-30 (53.3 percent) from the field. He is heating up and is worth scooping up in all standard fantasy leagues while running hot.

             The Bucks improved to 10-2 when Bledsoe scores 20 or more points. He continues to be solid since arriving in Cream City, posting top-50 fantasy value for the past five weeks. While he isn't needed to do as much heavy lifting at the offensive end like his days in Phoenix, he is still a nice fantasy asset. He also gives opponents another dangerous player to guard. He has another four-game week starting on Monday to please his fantasy owners.

Brogdon had his struggles, making just 5-of-14 from the floor while going 0-of-4 from behind the 3-point line. The good news was Snell wasn't very effective off the bench, so Brogdon could hang onto his job in the starting five. It's also good news that Jason Kidd used just eight players, or a tighter rotation, so Brogdon's value in standard leagues is looking up.

             It was opposite world in Detroit after the Pistons were destroyed on Thursday in Philly. The Pistons kept the Rockets off the line with only 11 attempts and they defended the 3-point line with Houston making only 15-of-47 from deep (31.9%). As for Harris, he snapped out of a mini-slump from deep with only one 3-pointer on his last 10 attempts, so maybe he'll get rolling again. He should be a mid-round player the rest of the way with top-50 upside.

             The Rockets did pull a Hack-A-Moreland in the fourth, but it didn't work with him making both. Andre Drummond (rib) is only day-to-day and Moreland doesn't have much upside despite what this stat line says. We'd rather add Boban over Moreland here.

             Henson hit 5-of-8 from the field while also chipping in with two assists, two blocked shots and two steals while turning it over just two times. His confidence has been growing lately, culminating in his first double-double since Nov. 30. It is also just his fourth double-double of the season. He continues to sail along with a 60.8 field-goal percentage, a career best. Henson is a solid fantasy option heading into the next scoring period, as the Bucks have four games on tap for a second straight week.

             It always felt like it was a matter of time before he would unseat Langston Galloway, and here we are. Buycks' fits the Pistons system really well and it's possible he gets minutes in the low 20s for the next couple weeks. He's a possible stream, DFS punt or deep-league add if you need a PG.

             It's worth a mention the Rockets ran a no-PG lineup out there for 1.8 minutes in this game with Gordon and Gerald Green at the guard spots. Plus, Gordon has an impressive 6.7 dimes per game over his last three. He should be busy while James Harden is out, so expect him to score in the 20s until the MVP candidate returns.

This is probably a better expectation than his outrageous three-game start, but this kind of line has some value for those seeking 3-pointers. His value is going to fall off once James Harden (hamstring) is back, but he is worth a look in standard leagues.

It was his first double-double of the season, don't get terribly excited about his fantasy value. However, he has some short-term appeal as long as Jonathon Simmons (back) is on the shelf.

             Not bad. He was almost on pace for a quadruple-double at half with all five of those steals coming in the first two quarters. Oladipo did not have any restrictions in this game, but he only need to play 24 minutes because this game was basically over at half. His fantasy owners have missed him after he was making a case as a first-round asset, and they'll get him for a four-game week to get a nice edge. He needs to be an All-Star.

             The 37-year-old wing has been a cool story this year after missing the last four NBA seasons. However, there's really not much to like from a fantasy perspective.

             Gordon was matching buckets with the best, hitting 13-of-26 from the field while adding eight rebounds, two steals and an assist across 32 minutes. He was especially hot in the second half, going for 24 points before fouling out. He'll look to build upon the momentum in Tuesday's game in Dallas in a very favorable matchup.

             He lost most of the momentum he built up with this line and Victor Oladipo returning explains that. Stephenson does have some consistency issues, so it's tough to buy the hot version that has been producing over the last two weeks. If you wanted to drop him for a hot free agent, it's not the worst idea.

             Korver was just 1-of-4 from the field, and he is now averaging just 6.5 points per game over his past six outings, nearly two buckets shy of his seasonal numbers. That's because he has hit just 13-of-39 (33.3 percent) from the floor during the span. He is about as streaky as they get, and right now his fantasy appeal is at its nadir. Hopefully a hot streak is right around the corner for his nervous owners.

             Thompson was a very efficient 4-of-6 from the field, but he was limited to 20 minutes off the pine because he picked up four personals. Since flipping the calendar from 2017 to 2017, he is averaging 8.3 points with 8.7 rebounds per game in three outings, both well above his season averages. Still, he remains useful only in larger standard leagues and some deeper category-based formats.

             This was about the garbage time here, so don't let this solid stat line change your perception on freeing Bobby Portis. He's more of a 14-team guy now, but he does have some stash appeal if the Bulls do trade Nikola Mirotic.

Basically, if Hield struggles again today, he'll be a drop candidate because this situation is a mess.

             He was sick after Friday's game, but the Bulls getting thumped explains the bad stat line. Mirotic continues to produce off the bench and his fantasy value should hold up as long as he's on the Chicago roster.

             The stat line doesn't even tell the story with Tatum turning his defense into offense, and hitting the biggest shot of the game with a corner 3-pointer with under a minute to help the Celtics earn this thrilling victory. Obviously those blocks pop on the stat sheet and he's the first Celtics rookie to record at least five blocks since Vitor Faverani -- props if you picked him up for that game back in 2013. Tatum just adds something new to his arsenal almost every week and it's almost like the height of his ceiling should be measured in light years.

             He didn't shoot the ball well yet again, making 8-of-22 from the field in this win. This team continues to win with defense and rank 25th in offense over their six-game winning streak, and the Celtics have held their opponent to less than 90 points in three consecutive games for the first time since the 2014-15 team. Irving should be better than his recent cold spell and he's still making a case to be a first-round asset going forward.

             He sandwiched his DNP-REST on Friday with 25 minutes on Wednesday and this game, so maybe his playing time is trending up again. However, his back-to-back restriction makes it hard to add him in standard leagues.

Theis has stepped up when Al Horford (knee) has missed time, so keep him in mind as a DFS punt or a stream, especially if it's against a bad team. He's not an add right now with Boston off until Jan. 11.

             He didn't have it in this game and coach Brad Stevens went away from him as the game went on. Rozier had played well in six straight, so it's hard to put too much stock in his tough night. Rozier's fantasy owners shouldn't worry too much here, but there are probably a few DFS players who didn't like this outcome. He's still a hold, but the Celtics have a few days off coming up.

             The refs were not being a friend to Dinwiddie late in this game and it may have cost the Nets here. Perhaps they're not giving him calls because Dinwiddie may be a sneaky pick for Most Improved Player this year, and his fantasy owners certainly know it based on how he's been hanging early-round value for almost two months now. Even when D'Angelo Russell (knee) comes back, Dinwiddie is too good to take off the floor.

             Bad game aside, Stauskas has a chance for more minutes with DeMarre Carroll (knee) getting hurt today. Sauce Castillo was basically the top option in the ""by committee"" approach at the backup PG, but he has cooled since his hot start in BK. Give him a look in a deeper league as a speculative add.

             You'd have a hard time finding a big-minute starter colder than Crabbe. Before this dud, he only made 36.8 percent from the field for his 10.8 points per game over his last 10, so Crabbe is a possible drop in shallower formats.

             There was a lot of traffic under the basket and Carroll's leg got bent backwards. He was able to put a little weight on his leg, but he needed help from Quincy Acy and someone else to get to the locker room. Considering Carroll's knee injury history, there's a good chance he has to miss time here. That should mean more run for Joe Harris, Allen Crabbe and Nik Stauskas.

Montrezl Harrell is worth a look if you need a big in a competitive league while Sam Dekker, Wes Johnson and others could step up.

             It'll be his nine start this season, averaging 10.5 points, 5.1 boards, 0.8 assists, 0.9 steals and 1.6 treys. It doesn't sound like Otto Porter (hip, back) will be out long, so Oubre's fantasy value shouldn't change too much beyond tonight.

            Stephen Curry went crazy during just 30 minutes in a 121-105 win over the Clippers on Saturday, making 11-of-21 from the field for a season-high 45 points with six rebounds, three assists, three steals and eight 3-pointers.
        
        
             Wow. He joins Klay Thompson, Gilbert Arenas and J.R. Smith as the only players to score at least 45 points in under 30 minutes since 1964. He scored 29 of those points in the first half and didn't even play in the fourth to post his 28th 40-point game of his career. Curry added a career-high 15 makes from the line to get him to an 80.2 TS% in this easy win. Curry actually had that 80.2 TS% in his previous three games since returning from injury, so he's just ridiculously hot right now. He is the best shooter ever and perhaps Nick Young said it best after the game. ""I think he ain't from this earth,""  Swaggy said.

             Most of this work was in garbage time and somewhat shockingly Bell was the last big off the bench -- he checked in with four minutes left in the second. His short-term upside is fading in a hurry here, but he's still really tough to cut in 12-team leagues because he only needs 15 minutes to be valuable.

             Probably the biggest story here was that Thompson got a haircut while in Los Angeles. He was on fire before this game, but he talked about how he struggled today. ""You see the way I was shooting? Short, left, right, every which way,"" he said. Even with the bad game, he was still able to extend his streak with 3-pointer to 94 minutes, which is third all time (Curry, Korver)

             On the second night of a back-to-back set, Porter is going to sit this one out. It's somewhat encouraging that he did not get ruled out right away, so maybe he only needs to miss one game after his back tightened up. Oubre is a possible pickup if you need a short-term boost while Markieff Morris also benefits.

             He started at small forward in the first half and power forward in the second half. Dekker had a couple ugly shots in this game and his offense really hasn't looked right all season. If you're looking for an add after the Blake Griffin injury, Montrezl Harrell is a better choice at this point.

             He had his back tighten up on him on Friday night and did not play in the fourth quarter. If Porter can't go, it'll be Kelly Oubre in the first unit today. Oubre would be a DFS option without Otto, assuming he avoids foul trouble.

             Hill was not with the team on Friday as he stays with his wife for the birth of their child. With Hill out, that should open up some minutes for Buddy Hield, Bogdan Bogdanovic, Garrett Temple and maybe Malachi Richardson. With Randolph out, we should get some Skal Labissiere action along with more Willie Cauley-Stein.

             This wasn't a garbage time special with Reed being called upon after the Blake Griffin (concussion) injury. Reed is still behind Montrezl Harrell in the big-man pecking order, so he's only a speculative add in very deep leagues.

             He's probably looking at a big role again with Blake Griffin (concussion) out. For what it's worth, Harrell was kind of rolling before Blake returned, posting a 22-point, eight-board game back on Dec. 26. With four games coming up this week, Harrell could be worth a look in 14-team leagues or even shallower if you need a big man in a pinch, especially with so many teams playing two games this week.

             It certainly wasn't the best NBA debut of all time, but he played well and he provides a lot of what the Clippers need right now. The 23-year-old guard played multiple positions, he's 6'5"", and coach Doc Rivers gave Jawun Evans a very quick hook to start the third quarter to replace him with Wallace. Some of the scoring is from garbage time, but Wallace had some really nice drives against Jordan Bell and even tried to dunk on him -- he got the foul. With Evans getting smoked on defense, the Cal product may actually get a start on Monday. Even with four games next week, you'd have to be in a pretty deep league to ride with Wallace.

             He is going to see Stephen Curry in his sleep tonight. On Thursday night, coach Doc Rivers talked a lot about how Evans is so small and Russell Westbrook dominated him, but this time he just was out of position against the best shooter in NBA history. Don't be surprised if Evans gets benched for Tyrone Wallace on Monday.

            Jonathon Simmons (back) is out for Saturday against the Cavs and Mario Hezonja will start.
        
        
             He was technically a game-time call, but coach Frank Vogel never expected him to play. Hezonja is a solid pickup in deeper leagues for as long as Simmons is out.

             He vomited after the game in Dallas on Saturday, so maybe that's part of the reason he didn't play well. You may want to look elsewhere in DFS unless you think he can carry on the Bulls flu game tradition.

             No surprise here after we saw J.J. Redick's shoulder hit Drummond square in the ribs on Friday night. It'll be a pain tolerance thing for Drummond, so he's almost certainly going to be a game-time call. If he's out, it's Boban Marjanovic time.

A healthy Oladipo has a great chance to be a first-round value in standard leagues.

             He went through his warmups and looked fine in the videos posted from the team reporters, but the Celtics are just going to play it safe here in the back-to-back set. With him out, the Celtics are going to look a little different with Horford being a point-center, but we should see their smaller lineup with Aron Baynes and Marcus Morris out there to start. Daniel Theis and Semi Ojeleye should also be looking at a few extra minutes.

            Michael Beasley (ankle) is questionable for Sunday against the Mavs.
        
        
             He rolled his ankle in the first minute of overtime on Friday and presumably he's dealing with some swelling. Beasley has been terrific in his high-volume scoring role off the bench, so the Knicks would have a hole to fill there. If he's out, that could mean more Doug McDermott, Lance Thomas or even Willy Hernangomez. There's really nobody worth adding speculatively just yet.

Horford did start the second half and didn't appear to be limited, so we're still expecting him to play here. Although, the back-to-back factor does come into play on this one. If he's out, Daniel Theis and Aron Baynes would handle the minutes at the five.

             He was down for about five minutes after a hard elbow to his head from JaVale McGee, but he did walk to the locker room under his own power. According to the Warriors broadcast, Griffin was alert and talking while the doctors were squeezing his hands after the injury. Considering how long Griffin was on the ground, there's a very good chance he misses multiple games. With Griffin, Austin Rivers and others out, the Clippers are going to be desperate for offense after Lou Williams. Montrezl Harrell is probably the better big-man add while Wes Johnson and Sam Dekker may also gain value.

             He was doubtful for this game and the Nets will hold him out, which is not unusual based on how the Nets are careful with their young players. LeVert still needs to be held in almost all leagues while Nik Stauskas, Joe Harris and Allen Crabbe pick up some extra run.

             He was a late scratch on Friday night and was in uniform. If Canaan can't play, that should extend the minutes of Tyler Ulis while it could create a chance for Davon Reed to make his NBA debut. Ulis could be a DFS option, but don't be surprised to see the Suns go bigger because of the Russell Westbrook factor. Keep an eye on Reed in super deep leagues.

             Both of these guys did not play on Friday in San Antonio. Warren stayed back at the team hotel in Texas before Friday's game, so he didn't even really have a chance to play. If he's out, that should put Josh Jackson in the starting lineup while it could be Danuel House or maybe Davon Reed as the backup.

             The Lakers are a little thin now with Andrew Bogut, so losing Nance would probably mean the Lakers would have to move Julius Randle back to the bench. Maybe the do roll out Ivica Zubac, but either way there's really pickup to make until we get word on Nance.

             The Warriors loaded up their injury report, but Durant will be the only one out today. He was reportedly taking plenty of 3-pointers yesterday and it sounds like being held out is a precaution, which makes a lot of sense. Durant is on a tear these days, but his fantasy owners should probably expect at least 3-5 more DNPs throughout the course of the season. For today, Andre Iguodala and Omri Casspi figure to benefit the most while Nick Young could also step up. Plus, the other All-Stars should shine bright.

             The Rockets waived Brown on Friday. Brown is currently in talks with teams in China, but the plan is reportedly for him to re-sign with Houston later in the year, and to play the remainder of the 2017-18 regular season and the postseason with the Rockets. There is very little fantasy fallout from this news, as Brown was averaging just 2.5 points in 5.8 minutes for the Rockets this season.

             Bogut signing with the Lakers was surprising, as L.A. seemed like a longshot for a playoff spot this season. He averaged just 1.5 points and 3.3 rebounds in 9.0 minutes over 24 games with L.A. He is now free to sign with another team that has a better chance of advancing to the postseason. However, it's extremely unlikely that Bogut will make a fantasy impact wherever he lands. He should be left on waivers.

             Reed has yet to appear in an NBA game after undergoing offseason surgery to repair a torn meniscus in his left knee. However, the 32nd overall pick in the 2017 NBA draft has plenty of talent and upside. With the Suns point guard situation unsettled, Reed could see some decent playing time over the second half of the season.

We should get final confirmation, one way or the other, when coach Stan Van Gundy meets with reporters pregame. However, with Avery Bradley now back, and Reggie Bullock and Luke Kennard playing well, Johnson will have a tough time earning consistent minutes even when he is fully healthy.

We should have a definitive update on Simmons' status from coach Vogel at approximately 5:30 pm when he addresses the media for his pregame presser.  If Simmons is unable to play, Mario Hezonja, Arron Afflalo and Wes Iwundu would likely divvy up additional minutes.

             Young was selected 17th overall by the Celtics in the 2014 draft but never lived up to expectations in Boston. He played 20 games for the Wisconsin Herd, the G League affiliate of the Milwaukee Bucks, this season and averaged 22.3 points and 5.7 rebounds.

             Porter sat out the entire fourth quarter of the Wizards wins over the Grizzlies on Friday night after his back tightened up late in the third quarter. Porter finished with just two points in 27 minutes on Friday. With Saturday being the second night of a back-to-back, the Wiz may choose to err on the side of caution and rest him. We should get an update early on Saturday. If Porter can't play,  Kelly Oubre would likely draw the start.

             KCP was a dismal 0-of-3 from the field (all from behind the perimeter) while posting just one steal and one turnover. It was a far cry from his solid 12-point, six-rebound effort last time out against the Thunder. He isn't allowed to travel outside of the state of California due to his legal issues, so it's a good thing the team has three more games at home through Jan. 11. He'll try to get back on track Sunday against the visiting Hawks.

             Kuzma was back to the bench, but he certainly didn't look like the super-sub we've seen in the past. His shot was way off, including 0-of-6 from behind the 3-point line. ""I just need to get back to playing hard. Not really playing that hard right now. We’re playing like garbage. It’s something I need to address and fix,"" Kuzma said. He'll fight through and get acclimated to coming off the bench after a nice run in the starting five. And regardless if he is a starter or reserve, he'll log plenty of minutes.

             He made both free throws to give him a pristine 93.7 TS%. Murray has been one of the most efficient young scorers in the NBA lately with his 63.2 TS% on a 23.8 usage rate over his last 13. To put that in perspective, no other qualifier under 22 years old can even hit 60 TS% and a 20 usage rate over the last 13 games. He's been the 17th-ranked player in nine-category leagues since Dec. 1, so congrats to all who held on after his rocky start to hit the bullseye on the Blue Arrow.

             The Lakers didn't have a very good game as a team, but Ingram certainly did his part. He was an efficient 10-of-18 from the field while going 1-of-1 from the free-throw stripe while turning over just three times. It was a nice bounce-back game after posting just seven points on 3-of-9 shooting last time out against OKC. It was also his first double-double since Nov. 15 against Philly.

             This is probably about as cold as he's going to get over a five-game span, averaging just 15.2 points, 9.6 boards, 5.4 assists, 1.4 steals, 0.8 blocks and 1.0 treys on 38.9 percent from the field. That's still pretty solid besides the low FG%, so there's little reason to worry about Jokic being a first-round property going forward.

             MKG is enjoying one of his better runs of the season, posting double-digit point totals in four of his past five outings. He is averaging 10.8 points, 4.8 rebounds and 1.8 assists over his past five outings while hitting a respectable 53.7 percent (22-of-41) from the field. He'll look to keep it rolling when play resumes Wednesday against Dallas.

             Revenge game! Lyles was viewed as a high-skill forward after his time as a point guard in high school, and now it looks like he's finally coming of age. Lyles' interior game has been helpful to open up his 3-point shooting, and today his back-to-the-basket offense was on display. Make it 10 straight with double-digit scoring with Lyles' rebounding numbers on the rise, too. He should be owned in standard leagues and this is another example of how you can't totally write off younger lottery picks.

             Don't worry about the low minutes, as the Blazers kept him on the sidelines for the whole fourth quarter due to the lopsided score. He did make several trips to the locker room tonight, but according to the Blazers' broadcast, he was just keeping his calf warm with some light stretching. He led Portland in shot attempts and was aggressive when he was out there, adding six assists, four rebounds, two steals, one block and two triples. He should be fresh and ready to roll on Sunday vs. the Spurs.

             Batum was a dismal 0-of-4 from behind the 3-point line while turning it over twice, but at least he salvaged the stat line with seven assists and three rebounds across his 28 minutes and he ended up sharing the team lead with a plus-15 rating. The normally consistent Batum has been rather erratic this season, and the problems can be traced to his elbow injury. He remains a fantasy must-start, but expect his totals to continue to yo-yo all season.

He has been under his season scoring average in three of the past four games, but at least he has given fantasy owners 17 assists over his past two games while posting two or more steals in four consecutive outings.

The Hawks aren't exactly a contender this season, so we still expect them to unleash the rookie at some point as the team continues to rack up lottery balls. He's a high-upside hold.

             Williams was a very efficient 6-of-9 from the field, including 4-of-6 from behind the 3-point line. He bounced back rather nicely after laying a couple of scoreless eggs to close out the 2017 calendar year. He is averaged 13.0 PPG over the past two games, which is a couple of buckets better than his season average. While he has top-100 fantasy ability, he remains more of a low-end asset despite his status in the starting five.

             No one on the Hawks played particularly well and Ersan Ilyasova led all starters in minutes played with 27. This isn't the first time the Hawks have been blown out this season, so Schroder's owners know the drill. Sunday's game vs. the Lakers should be much closer and Schroder is in a great spot to bounce back with the Lakers allowing the second most fantasy points to PGs this season.

             The most famous street in Memphis is named Beale Street, but he was the most famous Beal in Grind City on Friday. He finished 9-of-18 from the field, including 5-of-10 from behind the 3-point line, while going a perfect 11-of-11 from the free-throw stripe. Beal continues to produce top-40 fantasy results as he aims for a second consecutive Player of the Week honor.

In this win, Wall was aggressive as a scorer with three shooting fouls drawn within five feet. He also brought it as a passer with four dimes leading to treys and four to makes at the rim. Maybe he'll heat up after a slow start.

""A couple of times I guarded him, I did a pretty solid job defensively."" As for fantasy, he hit 6-of-12 shots and has been more efficient in that area lately, but his free throws are still a concern -- he was 1-of-5 from the line and was only hitting 68.1% from there prior to Friday.

             It was vintage Kawhi and coach Gregg Popovich is taking notice of Kawhi getting healthy. ""Kawhi’s looked more and more like himself every game,"" Pop said.

Besides the rest, Kawhi's fantasy owners are starting to see why he's so valuable in fantasy.

He does have some hip issues in his career, so this will be something to watch. Kelly Oubre would be an interesting speculative add while Markieff Morris also would benefit.

             Besides the bad shooting game, he looked better again. Chriss was making smart passes out of double teams, he only had three fouls in all that playing time, and he showed some post moves while recognizing mismatches. In the first quarter, coach Jay Triano yelled at Chriss when he took him out, but it looked like the message was received. Amazingly, we haven't seen an ""oh no Marquese Chriss was bad again"" game in seven games, which seemed impossible a month ago. There's still some work to do, but you'd be hard pressed to find a player making a bigger turnaround since Chrissmas Christmas. He's worth owning for upside.

             Hassan Whiteside sat out the final 21:01 of this game with Olynyk closing alongside James Johnson. He's been a top-100 player for the past month and this double-double comes on the heels of a 25-point game on Wednesday with 13 rebounds, three assists and three 3-pointers on Wednesday, so make sure he's not sitting on your wire.

             Antetokounmpo finished 9-of-14 from the field, while hitting 6-of-9 from the free-throw stripe while turning it over just twice. Not only is he popular with fantasy owners for his ability to fill up the stat sheet, but even casual fans are starting to take notice of this budding superstar from Cream City. The Greek Freak is actually ahead LeBron James in early NBA All-Star voting.

             He gets some Kawhi Leonard comparisons for his skillset coming out of college, but yeah. Not there yet and Kawhi took him to school most of the night. Warren did not even go to the arena and had to stay at the hotel for the road game, so it's possible he's still sick with the flu on Sunday. Jackson's career is off to a slow start and there's really not enough upside to stash in most formats.

             Despite the rough shooting line, you have to love the workload in just his second game back after a six-game absence in December. The Heat rolled with James Johnson and Kelly Olynyk down the stretch and the move paid off with Johnson coming up with a huge steal late. He had 16 points on 6-of-8 shooting, four rebounds and one assist on Wednesday, so expect a better fantasy line on Sunday vs. Utah.

             The second-year guard didn't really have a backup in this game, which explains the 35 minutes. He did turn his left ankle in this game on a shot near the baseline, but Ulis was able to stay out there. Isaiah Canaan (groin) was a late scratch here and he was in uniform, so Ulis should get some competition on Sunday. He's only a low-end hold and hasn't really improved from his second half last season.

             Ellington was the MVP for Miami tonight and came up with a huge loose ball in the final seconds. The Heat are legitimately concerned about Dion Waiters' ankle and he doesn't have a timetable, making Ellington an appealing grab off the waiver wire. He's now played 32 or more minutes in eight of his last nine games and is averaging 14.3 points, 5.3 rebounds and 3.6 triples in that span.

             He had to play more because of T.J. Warren (illness) not suiting up, but House was basically out of the rotation coming into this game -- he only played three minutes during a 23-point loss on Wednesday. House probably didn't play well enough to get in the rotation upon Warren's return.

             He got worked on defense and coach Jay Triano may have tried to get a little too cute with smaller lineups. He's still be able to do damage with his minutes in the 20s and he's not in the DNP-REST plan with Tyson Chandler and Greg Monroe, so he's still a hold depending on what centers are available in your league.

             He was productive during his time on the floor and hit 6-of-11 shots including a pair of long-range two-pointers, but coach Erik Spoelstra pulled him with 4:01 left in the third quarter and never looked his way again. This is the second time in a row something like this has happened after Whiteside was benched for the final six minutes of Wednesday's game, but to his credit, he was engaged and supportive of his teammates when he was on the bench. Kelly Olynyk had another good game tonight and logged 35 minutes, so Whiteside's fantasy arrow is pointing down at the moment. We'll be watching him closely on Sunday vs. the Jazz.

He has scored 10 or more points in each outing, but he is still only a low-end fantasy option in deeper leagues until further notice.

             Wright was very efficient, hitting 5-of-7 from the field, and he did not turn the ball over once. He was seeing some added playing time in the final quarter with Kyle Lowry, DeMar DeRozan and the rest of the starters getting a well-earned rest with the game pushed out of hand in a dominating third quarter. Wright continues to be red hot when called up on and he paying some nice dividends for those who picked him up eight games ago. Plus, Lowry is playing through some swollen fingers, so that could help Wright's playing time.

            Kyrie Irving scored 16 points with nine rebounds, eight assists, two steals and one 3-pointer during a 91-84 win over the Wolves on Friday.
        
        
             Boston's defense was the key as they've held two playoff teams in the Wolves and Cavs to under 90 points in their last two games. The Celtics also have fixed their late-game issues since Christmas with a five-game winning streak while Kyrie has been just OK by his standards. He averaged 20.4 points, 6.4 boards, 5.6 assists, 1.4 steals and 1.8 treys on 43.2 percent from field in that span. He gets a great matchup against the Nets on Saturday.

             He recently admitted that he's ""so tired,"" and you could tell down the stretch -- he wasn't aggressive when the Knicks needed him to be and he scored just six points in the fourth quarter and overtime combined. One of the concerns fantasy owners have about him is whether or not he can handle the grind of an 82-game season, so hopefully he can fight through the fatigue and stay healthy. He's shooting a combined 15-of-46 from the field in his last three games, but he does have a couple good matchups coming up against the Mavericks and Bulls.

             D-Ro was contributing in multiple areas while going 7-of-12 from the field, finishing with a stellar plus-34 rating before departing. He was rested most of the fourth quarter with the game well in hand. He'll see two more full days to rest over the weekend before the team takes to the court again on Monday in a very favorable fantasy matchup against the defensively-challenged Nets.

             He suffered a minor knee injury to keep him out for his usual second-quarter minutes, but he returned to start the second half and looked fine. His 197 assists this season are the most by a center through the team's first 41 games in franchise history, and he's looking to be among the league leaders for dimes at center like last season. Horford said he feels good about playing on Saturday, but you'll want to make sure there's no update to change his status. He's been terrific this season as an early-round center in standard leagues.

             Lowry finished with a solid plus-20 evening, hitting 5-of-10 from the field, including 4-of-8 from behind the 3-point line, while turning it over just once. He was given a good chunk of the fourth quarter off with the game well in hand, turning it over to the bench for some extra run. It should be another fruitful night for Lowry, his fantasy owners and DFS players when the Raps visit the Nets on Monday.

             Beasley rolled his ankle during the opening minute of overtime, but came back into the game for the final 25 seconds. He still had a noticeable limp, but hopefully it doesn't swell up too much overnight. 13 of his 20 points came after the third quarter and Beasley continues to produce for the Knicks and for fantasy owners,  posting averages of 19.2 points, 9.0 rebounds, 2.4 assists, 1.0 blocks and 1.4 steals in 25.4 minutes over his last five games. The Knicks are using him alongside Kristaps Porzingis these days, so keep throwing him into your lineups while he's hot .

             Valanciunas yielded to Pascal Siakam and Lucas Nogueira for most of the second half, as the game got out of hand in the third quarter. Obviously with his outstanding shooting night, it was the lopsided score and nothing Dwane Casey didn't like, which sent Valanciunas to the pine earlier than usual. J.V. faces another great matchup on Monday in Brooklyn.

             That's the fourth time he saw clearly with 20/20 vision in his career, and he also put up his 10th double-double in the first half alone. Towns leads the NBA in double-doubles with 32 in his 39 games and he's been terrific in both percentages along the way. KAT may not be the best player in fantasy per game, but he has yet to miss a game in his career.

             It's Bizarro Wiggins with some defensive stats and very little scoring. Boston handled him through this game, so just chalk up the bad shooting to a bad matchup. Although, Wiggins made just 39.8 percent from the field in December, so his fantasy value is very low right now.

             It was one of his worst starts of the season with a couple silly fouls. Jones' clock is probably ticking as the starter with Jeff Teague (knee) possibly coming back in the next week or so. The Wolves do play on Saturday and they'll play every other day until they start a back-to-back set on Jan. 24, so the schedule may help Teague hold his value.

             He was shaking his injured right hand several times throughout this game, so it's obviously bothering him. Embiid was also shaking his left hand in the third quarter, so that's something to watch, as well. He'll be getting a lot of time to heal up with the 76ers off until Jan. 11, so that should definitely help.

             The 76ers just dominated this game and it was Ben Simmons doing the damage. In almost 16 minutes, Simmons scored 15 points and accounted for another 20 points off his dimes. The low playing time was all about the garbage time, so expect him to get back up to 36 against the Celtics on Jan. 11. Yes, the 76ers have a little break coming up here.

             Not much to takeaway here as the Pistons fell behind 32-15 after the first quarter and got rocked again in the second 30-17.  Smith will continue to start and should be owned in standard leagues despite some FG% concerns.

             It was very clear he was dealing with his rib injury. On the first possession of the second quarter, J.J. Redick's shoulder hit Drummond in his ribs and Drummond went to the ground in pain. He did stay in the game, but it was certainly affecting him. He's on a back-to-back set for Saturday and the Pistons won't be shooting around, so his owners may just want to make sure he's good to go against Houston. It sounds like he's OK, though.

Bad season aside, Bradley was just too good last season and he did play 38 minutes in his return on Wednesday. We would still suggest holding him in just about all leagues.

             It's not a very Boban-esque line, but the good news is he did check in ahead of Eric Moreland. Maybe we're getting to the point where Marjanovic can take over the backup spot, but his owners in deep leagues should probably expect him to be a DNP-CD in the next couple games. That said, his upside is so high that he's still worth holding in deeper leagues and Andre Drummond's rib injury was bothering him today.

             Conley did increase his activity at practice this week, but he hasn't taken full contact yet and he said he's been battling soreness. He did say that he fully expects to play again this season, but this is getting more and more frustrating for his fantasy owners. We'd like his rest-of-season outlook a lot better if the Grizzlies were somewhat competitive in the West.

Ball is safe to deploy in season-long lineups, but his appeal in DFS is limited due to the restrictions. If you picked up Tyler Ennis in a deep league, it's time to move on. Jordan Clarkson's value also takes a hit with Ball back.

             The Grizzlies will be changing their starting lineup here and Harrison has played well as an off-ball guy. There's a decent chance Kobi Simmons gets a long look here while Mario Chalmers could also see an uptick in playing time. Keep an eye on Simmons in deep leagues.

             After an minor injury on Wednesday, he wasn't on the injury report today. It's a late scratch for the backup point guard here and he'll likely be questionable for Sunday against the Thunder. For tonight, we'll be seeing a lot of Devin Booker at the point and Tyler Ulis should see decent minutes, as well. There should be more minutes for Troy Daniels and maybe even Danuel House with T.J.

We should also see more Devin Booker at the three, which would open up minutes for Troy Daniels. Daniel House could also be called on for more run, but would be a risky DFS play. Warren should have a chance to suit up for Sunday against the Thunder.

             He should be back out there after missing the last two games. Casspi could be looking at minutes for this game because Kevin Durant (calf) is questionable.

             Iguodala has been a regular on the injury reports this season, but he's expected to play through this minor ailment for now. If Kevin Durant (calf) and Omri Casspi (back) can't go, Iggy will be a nice streaming option after scoring 10 points (5-of-9 FGs) with nine assists, two rebounds, two steals, one block and two turnovers in 31 minutes on Thursday vs. Houston.

             It's yet another injury for Green, but it doesn't appear to be anything too serious. Check back on Saturday morning for an update after their shootaround, but Green's owners can leave him in lineups for now. He was terrific on Thursday vs. Houston, racking up 17 points with 14 rebounds and 10 assists for his 21st triple-double of his career. If he does sit, Jordan Bell will be an excellent streaming option.

            Kevin Durant (right calf strain) is questionable to face the Clippers on Saturday.
        
        
             He missed Thursday night due to a calf strain after he played through it on Wednesday. KD also had a lower-leg issue from last week, so maybe that's part of it, as well. The Warriors won't be risking him and they beat the Rockets in Houston on Thursday to give them some cushion for the No. 1 seed. If he's out, Andre Iguodala and Omri Casspi could play more, assuming they're a go.

             Wilson was on a two-way contract with the Clippers and had some nice moments while Blake Griffin was out, but the Clippers need help at guard with Austin Rivers (bruised heel) out and Milos Teodosic re-aggravating his foot injury on Thursday.

             It makes sense because Wallace is listed at 6'5"", so coach Doc Rivers may have another PG defensive option. Jawun Evans is undersized and coach Doc Rivers mentioned how Evans had a tough night against Russell Westbrook on Thursday. Wallace's G League averages are solid at 22.8 points, 6.0 boards, 5.4 assists, 1.5 steals, 0.9 blocks and 0.6 treys. Don't be surprised to see him in the rotation on Saturday.

Drummond's main issue will be pain tolerance, so expect for the Pistons to protect him with something. This could mean Boban Marjanovic moves out of the rotation, or maybe Boban does get the backup minutes after an impressive Wednesday.

While he's out, Semi Ojeleye should be the next man up while Aron Baynes could see additional run against the bigger Wolves frontcourt.

Lue told reporters that upon his return, Rose will take minutes and games away from Dwyane Wade. Lue wants to prevent both Wade and Isaiah Thomas from playing in back-to-backs, which will open up some playing time for Rose. ""I haven't had any pain, I haven't had any setbacks,"" Rose said. ""If anything I've been progressing every day and every week, so I'm on the right track.

             The Pistons did not hold a shootaround on Friday, so we will have to wait until coach Stan Van Gundy speaks to the media at approximately 5:30 pm for an update on Drummond's status. On Thursday, Van Gundy said Drummond's return would depend on his pain tolerance. If Drummond is unable to play on Friday, Boban Marjanovic would likely draw another start at center.

            Victor Oladipo (sore right knee) is listed as questionable for Saturday's game vs. Chicago.
        
        
             Oladipo has sat out each of the Pacers last four games but is clearly trending in the right direction. Encouragingly, he practiced without restrictions on Thursday. When asked if he was eased back during Thursday's practice, Oladipo replied, ""I don’t ease back. Maybe that’s tough for some people, but not me."" Coach Nate McMillan said Oladipo's status for Saturday will be determined by how 'Dipo's knee responds to Friday's practice. Lance Stephenson will get bumped back to the bench if Oladipo returns.

             Waiters isn't practicing with the team and has already been ruled out of Friday's game vs. New York. This is obviously a worrisome situation, as Waiters ankle has been giving him problems since last season. Josh Richardson, Tyler Johnson, and Wayne Ellington will continue to soak up extra minutes in his absence.

             Anderson has not appeared in a game since November 15th. It's safe to assume the Sixers will limit his minutes in his first few games back. However, he was averaging just 12.6 minutes per game over the first month of the season, so that shouldn't be an issue. Anderson may eat into the playing time of Timothe Luwawu-Cabarrot off the bench.

             The Celtics continue to limit Morris' workload as he works his way back from a nagging knee injury. Friday is the front end of a back-to-back, so Morris will likely return on Saturday when the C's take on the Nets. He started Wednesday vs. Cleveland, but finished with just three points on 1-of-6 shooting, four rebounds, two assists, one steal and one block in 25 minutes. He belongs on waivers in standard leagues.

             Simmons did not play in the second half of Orlando's game on Wednesday due to back spasms, so it is not surprising to see him listed as questionable on the injury report for Saturday. We should have a more thorough update by Saturday morning. If Simmons is unable to play, Mario Hezonja, Arron Afflalo and Wes Iwundu would likely divvy up additional minutes.

Mirotic missed the first 23 games of the 2017-18 season after getting punched in the face by teammate Bobby Portis. Chicago was 3-20 in those first 23 contests but is 10-5 in the 15 games since Niko has returned.

Rivers also said that the Clippers can't have Lou Williams bringing the ball up all game because his shot looked flat due to fatigue, so the Clippers are really going to have to figure some things out -- Blake Griffin should also be an option. Teodosic is a drop candidate with Jawun Evans likely to start on Saturday as a possible deep-league add.

             Make it five 30-point games on the season for PG-13 as he put the Clippers away with 10 points in the fourth and eight in the third. George's knee soreness hasn't really affected his stats in the three games before and the three games after the DNP on Dec. 29, averaging 27.2 points per game on a ridiculous 78.9 TS% and a 25.1 usage rate in those six. He won't be this good, but the NBA's leader in steals is cleaning up right now.

             He's in one of his best offensive grooves on the season with three straight games with at least 20 points, which hasn't happened since his six straight to start this season. His December was a big letdown with just 15.1 points per game in that month, which is his worst monthly scoring average ever for a full month. Maybe he can turn it on as he becomes more of a shooter.

             He did suffer what looked like a right ankle tweak in the first half, but he did stay in the game and looked fine. Adams continues to smash on the offensive glass with seven tonight to get him to a league-leading 5.0 per game. Amazingly, that's more than he has on the defensive side, so you can chalk that up to Russell Westbrook however you like. Whatever the case, Adams has been outstanding in fantasy and reality.

             That definitely works after his head-turning game on Wednesday on national TV when he dropped 24 on the Lakers. Ferguson fits the bill for what the Thunder will want on the wing as a guy who runs the floor in transition, takes treys to space the floor and has length to defense on the perimeter. He's probably not going to get double-digit shots too often and he'll have to make his money in steals and treys. He's worth a look in very deep leagues until at least Andre Roberson (knee) gets back.

             The Clippers lost yet another ball-handler with Milos Teodosic (foot) going down and Griffin handled the offense in the high post a bunch in this game. Before the game, coach Doc Rivers said he's had to come up with more game plans this season than ever before due to so many injuries to his guys, so that'll be more pressure for Griffin to create offense. Expect him to flirt with some triple-doubles with high scoring numbers for the foreseeable future.

Jordan's scoring output doesn't really vary much with a whopping 28.1 percent of his offensive possessions coming off offensive rebounds (via Synergy). Jordan is now just 0.01 rebounds per game behind Andre Drummond for the league lead.

That said, there's not much upside here with Jawun Evans being the more attractive pickup.

             His minutes were a shade down from what they were in the last two when he played 36.5 minutes per game, and that looked to be by design. Before the game, coach Doc Rivers was asked about putting so much on Williams because of all the injuries to other key players, and Rivers said there was some concern about wear and tear, especially with the Austin Rivers (heel) issue. To be clear, Williams is fairly healthy and Rivers added Williams still wants to get get heavy run. ""Lou doesn’t mind scoring. I can tell you that,"" Rivers said. Even with the wear-and-tear concerns, Williams is going to be extremely busy as the 1B scoring option to Blake Griffin.

             That's his second start since returning from his foot soreness, but it's really the first time he's been able to play big minutes since his injury last month. Johnson can play both wing spots and now the Clippers really need depth 1-3 due to more injuries. Johnson won't have value in points leagues because he's not much of a scorer, but he's an attractive add for owners in 14-team leagues looking for some defensive stats and treys.

He played well into the fourth quarter today and he could be getting close to 26-30 minutes at least until Austin Rivers (heel) and Milos come back -- it sounds like it'll be longer than two weeks for Rivers. If you need a point guard with a mysterious upside and are OK with bad FG%, give him a look.

             He has not really stepped up since James Harden went down with Ariza taking all eight shots from deep. Ariza's minutes are always going to be there and his hot stretches are tied heavily to how well he shoots the ball and not how often he shoots it with injured players in and out of the lineup. He's still doing just fine as a must-start player in standard leagues and has typically been a strong finisher.

            Briante Weber scored two points with two rebounds, two assists and one turnover in 12 minutes against the Warriors on Thursday.
        
        
             With James Harden (hamstring) not out there, someone has to fill in the gaps for when Chris Paul isn't on the floor. In the last two games, it's been all Weber to pick up the remaining 28 minutes CP3 hasn't been on the floor. Paul hasn't exactly been healthy this season, so Weber does have some deep-league value as a handcuff.

            Clint Capela double-doubled vs. the Warriors on Thursday with 15 points, 10 rebounds and one block in 28 minutes.
        
        
             It's a small sample size, but it looks like Capela will be just fine while James Harden (hamstring) is out. He's averaging 18.0 points, 9.0 boards and 1.5 blocks in his last two games sans Harden, and his game continues to grow each day on both ends -- he even hit the Warriors with a Euro-step layup tonight. One of the most improved players in real life and in fantasy, his rest-of-season outlook remains strong.

            According to ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski, the Rockets are planning to keep Gerald Green for the remainder of the season.
        
        
             Talk about a no-brainer. Green was incredible again on Thursday vs. the Warriors, racking up 29 points and eight 3-pointers with three rebounds and one steal in 34 minutes. He was unemployed last week, so it's borderline ridiculous that he's averaging 21.0 points, 3.8 rebounds, 1.3 steals and 5.3 triples over his last four games. He has a reputation of being one of the streakiest shooters in the NBA, but grab him while he's hot, especially with James Harden (hamstring) out a while.

             The Splash Brothers combined for 60 points and 11 triples with Kevin Durant (calf) out. Thompson finished 12-of-21 from the field with four assists and three rebounds, and he's now scored 21+ points in four straight games with 17 total triples in that span. He's been a top-24 player in standard 9-category leagues this season and there's no reason why he can't hold it for the rest of the campaign.

            David West sprained his left ankle on Thursday vs. Houston, finishing with 12 points, two rebounds, two assists and two blocks.
        
        
             Chris Paul crossed him up and West fell back several feet after he rolled his left ankle. He stayed on the bench for a while, but went back to the locker room late in the fourth quarter and never came back. He said he's ""fine,"" but he'll be re-evaluated on Friday and should be considered questionable vs. the Clippers on Saturday. If he can't go, it's impossible to predict who coach Steve Kerr will play in his place, but JaVale McGee, Jordan Bell and Kevon Looney are the candidates.

            Jordan Bell played just six minutes vs. the Rockets on Thursday, finishing with one block and zero shot attempts.
        
        
             For the first time in a while, Bell didn't make a big impact upon his entrance and coach Steve Kerr kept him on a short leash. He didn't play at all in the second half with the Warriors turning to Kevon Looney, but we don't expect that trend to continue. His owners should give him a chance to bounce back on Saturday vs. the Clippers, especially with David West injuring his ankle tonight.

             He started for the injured Kevin Durant (calf) and looked healthy for the first time in a while -- He looked bouncy and had some really nice dunks. Incredibly, this was his first game with double-digit points since the end of November, so it's hard to get behind an add unless we know for sure that Durant will miss more time (he's day-to-day).

             Green was 5-of-9 from the field and 7-of-8 from the line, adding two steals and one block in 38 minutes. He's had some tough luck with injuries lately (most recently a left ankle sprain), but playing 38 minutes in each game of a back-to-back set is a really good sign. The Warriors are now 21-0 when Green records a triple-double, and he became the franchise leader in the process, passing Tom Gola (20).

             Curry grabbed nine rebounds with five assists, one steal and four triples in 37 minutes. The Rockets gave the Warriors a run for their money down the stretch, but Curry's 3-point bomb with 2:40 to play put the game out of reach. He gets a massive usage rate bump (26.4 to 39.0) when Kevin Durant (calf) is not on the floor, so it's not a surprise that he went off. Curry and the Warriors will be looking for their fourth win in a row on Saturday vs. the Clippers.
