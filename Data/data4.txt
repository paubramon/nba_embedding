            Justise Winslow went 7-of-16 from the field and 3-of-3 from the line on his way to a season-high 18 points in Wednesday's 115-86 win over the Hawks.
        
        
             Winslow added one 3-pointer, one rebound, five assists and two turnovers in his 27 minutes off the bench, and this was a very nice bounce-back performance following Tuesday's two-point disaster. He'll continue to see some increased opportunity while Dwyane Wade (wrist) and James Johnson (ankle) are out.

             Olynyk drained all five of his triples during the second quarter of action, and he also cracked 1700 total minutes on the season, which queued a $1 million bonus in his contract. Hassan Whiteside finished with four points, 13 rebounds, two assists and three blocks through 21 minutes as a starter, but Olynyk really outplayed him and closed out the game.

            Bam Adebayo pulled down 10 rebounds during Wednesday's win in Atlanta, adding four points, two assists, three steals and one block in 20 minutes off the bench.
        
        
             Adebayo was able to get back into the rotation with James Johnson (ankle) watching from the sidelines, but he struggled to get his shot to drop (1-of-6 shooting) and also committed three turnovers. He could fall out of the rotation again when Johnson gets back, so he's not the most attractive add in most settings.

            Anthony Davis scored 28 points with 12 rebounds, two assists, two steals, three blocks and one 3-pointer in 31 minutes against the Grizzlies during a 123-95 win on Wednesday.
        
        
             There were a couple minor injury notes here. Davis fell late in the first half and the team said he suffered a ""lower left leg injury"" on the play. Davis also had a heat wrap on his back in the fourth quarter, but coach Alvin Gentry even risked AD out there with a 20-point lead. Small injuries are nothing new to AD, and he could still have a shot at his second 75-game season, assuming he plays in the final four contests this year.

             Ellington drilled his 207th (at 3) 3-pointer of the season in this one, which set a new single-season record for the most 3-pointers off the bench in NBA history, and he also recorded his 300th career steal. He ranks in the top-10 in 3-pointers per game this season dropping in 2.9 trey-bombs a night, and he’ll have some increased opportunity for minutes while Dwyane Wade (wrist) is out.

             This was a solid bounce-back performance for J-Rich following Tuesday's nine-point effort, and he had the ball in his hands a bit more than usual in this one with Goran Dragic (ankle) and Dwyane Wade (wrist) unavailable. With the win, Miami clinched all tiebreakers with Milwaukee and Washington, so they're pretty much locked in at the No. 6 seed.

            Tyler Johnson was held to just six points on 3-of-10 shooting Wednesday, to go with two rebounds, two assists, one block and two turnovers in 23 minutes.
        
        
             This was a fairly large letdown for anyone who deployed Johnson in DFS with Goran Dragic (ankle) and Dwyane Wade (wrist) unavailable, but the game turned into a blowout, so Johnson wasn't needed for extended minutes. We'd expect a bit of a bounce-back performance on Friday in New York.

             Lee had the hot hand early, scoring seven points on 3-of-4 shooting within the first two minutes of the game, but unfortunately, with the game getting out of hand early, his minutes were limited. He’s played well since landing in Atlanta, and is on the radar as a potential deep league, steals specialist.

             Dedmon looked fine in his return from a one-game absence, and with him back in action, Mike Muscala's minutes dipped to 20 and he finished with four rebounds, one assist, two blocks and one turnover while missing all seven of his field goal attempts. Dedmon is the better big to own here, although we'd just recommend avoiding the whole situation.

             He caught fire to get him to his second 30-point game of the season, making 11-of-16 from the field in this easy win. Moore could be picking up some extra shots because of Ian Clark (ankle) going down tonight. He should be owned in most fantasy leagues in what has been a mini-breakout year.

             Collins added eight rebounds, four assists, one 3-pointer, one block and three turnovers while he was out there, but Hassan Whiteside's length really bothered him, and the turnovers were an issue. On a positive note, Collins has been attempting 3.0 triples per game over the past five, and he's hitting 40.0% of those attempts, so that might be a larger part of his game as the year winds down.

             The biggest news of the day is that Mirotic shaved his beard because he wanted a different look. Well, apparently the dropped weight on his face helped his shot selection with his 10-of-12 line from the field.

             Taylor got off to a horrible start and just wasn't able to turn things around, and with the game essentially being over by halftime, he took an early seat on the bench and Mike Budenholzer went with a 13-man rotation. The Hawks are simply a mess, and they could be rolling out some wonky lineups over the final three games of the year, but Taylor should be a fixture in the rotation no matter what. His inconsistency relegates him to deep league status, though.

            Rajon Rondo scored two points with seven rebounds, 13 assists and two turnovers in 28 minutes against the Grizzlies on Wednesday.
        
        
             If Ian Clark (ankle) is going to miss time, Rondo is going to get a few more minutes as the lone PG because Jrue Holiday would likely be staggered away from him a bit. The Pelicans have just a 1.0-game lead over the Nuggets for the No. 8 spot, so Rondo may not get rested again.

            MarShon Brooks posted season-highs with 25 points, four rebounds and seven assists against the Pelicans during a 123-95 loss on Wednesday, adding five 3-pointers and two steals.
        
        
             He was the first Grizzlies player ever to score 20-plus points in his first two games, so now he adds to that with a third. Brooks finally played huge minutes in this game after playing just 39 in his first two games combined. The Grizzlies may give him an extended look and Brooks looks like a hot pickup in most leagues.

            Jarell Martin rolled his left ankle and did not return on Wednesday, finishing with 15 points, five rebounds, one assist and two 3-pointers.
        
        
             He's had a lot of left foot problems in his NBA career, so hopefully everything is OK structurally. Martin was not putting weight on his left foot as he checked out with two minutes left in the fourth. If he's out, Ivan Rabb could be the man at PF.

             He took over for Wayne Selden (knee) and Selden has been hurt a lot this year, so maybe McLemore sticks in the first unit. MarShon Brooks looks like the better add, though.

             Jarell Martin (ankle) got hurt tonight and JaMychal Green (knee) is dealing with an injury, so Rabb could be the last PF standing. He's on the radar as a DFS play or stream.

            Marc Gasol did not score with two rebounds, three assists, one steal and three turnovers in 20 minutes against the Pelicans on Wednesday.
        
        
             He didn't exactly look thrilled on the bench in the second half with the Grizzlies getting blown out, and putting up just his third scoreless game of his NBA career. The Grizzlies tank is a well-oiled machine right now as they sit 1.5 games behind the Suns for the No. 1 spot in the lotto. The Hawks are right behind the Grizzlies by a half game, so the Grizzlies are likely going to be holding Gasol out for at least one more game.

             He scored 16 points in the first quarter alone, but Gordon wasn't out there down the stretch in this close game. That was obviously by design, but the Magic still couldn't earn the loss. This tough win moved the Magic down to No. 5 in the lottery, and they're only 0.5 games up on the Kings for No. 6. Don't be surprised to see Gordon get a night off in the last week of the season.

             It was a 15-9 minute split with Bismack Biyombo in the first half, but Birch was out there for the majority of the second half and closed out. Coach Frank Vogel has said he wants to play Birch more, so maybe Nikola Vucevic misses at least 1-2 more games.

             Simmons helped extend Philly’s win streak to 12, and with the win, the 76ers moved a full two games ahead of Indiana for the No. 4 spot, and they are also currently tied record-wise with Cleveland. Simmons has had a phenomenal rookie year, as he leads all rookies in double-doubles (36), and currently sits in third place in triple-doubles with 11 on the year. He’s also set the 76ers’ rookie record for most assists in a season, so he’s a strong candidate for the Rookie of the Year award.

             Redick was hot to start the game, getting off a quick 13 points on 5-of-6 shooting through the first quarter of action, and he kept his foot on the gas pedal throughout the game. He’s been much more involved in the offense ever since Joel Embiid (face) hit the sidelines, seeing his usage rate spike to 25.9 and he’s responded with averages of 20.8 points, 3.0 treys, 3.0 assists and 2.0 turnovers per game on 57.9% shooting.

             Ilyasova added one 3-pointer, one assist and one turnover through 33 minutes of floor time, so while he struggled to get his shot to drop (4-of-16 from the field and 4-of-6 from the stripe), he still came through with a pretty solid stat line. Dario Saric (elbow) could be back in action on Friday, which would likely shift Ilyasova back to the second unit, although he should still see steady minutes for Philly to close out the year with Joel Embiid (orbital fracture) on the sidelines.

            Bismack Biyombo made a start against the Mavs on Wednesday, handing out a career-high five assists with 12 points, 12 rebounds, one steal and one block in 22 minutes.
        
        
             Almost all of that production came in the first half, but the Magic went into the tank to keep Biyombo on the bench. Nikola Vucevic should be back for the next one, so leave Biz on the wire.

             Jackson also came through with four rebounds, seven assists, one block and two turnovers, and while he got off to a solid start, earning all six of his free throws attempts within the first four minutes of play, he just couldn't find his shot tonight. With the loss, the Pistons were officially eliminated from the postseason, so Jackson could start losing some minutes to Ish Smith over Detroit's final handful of games.

Stanley Johnson finished with 19 points, two triples, five boards, four dimes, three steals and five turnovers in 33 minutes, and he too is in danger of losing playing time to Kennard as the season winds down.

             Tolliver has been solid as a starter this season, posting averages of 13.0 points, 2.6 triples, 4.2 boards, 2.0 assists, 1.0 steal and just 0.7 turnovers per game on 49.3% shooting, so as long as he’s starting, he’ll be worth owning in most leagues. However, with the Pistons now mathematically eliminated from the postseason, he might not have much time left running with the first unit.

             He had a productive back-to-back set with 16 points on Tuesday. The Magic are probably going to sit some other players in the coming days, so maybe Artis can string together a few games. The rookie is on the map as a stream or DFS punt.

             Not only did the Pistons get eliminated from postseason play on their own home court tonight, but they lost in embarrassing fashion to a team that Stan Van Gundy was very critical of during the early stages of the process. This is the second year in a row that the Pistons will miss the postseason, and you have to wonder if SVG’s job as President of Basketball Operations is in danger.

             He only played 49 minutes in his entire NBA career before tonight, but the Mavs went with him early, often and late as he closed in this loss. Motley could find himself getting huge minutes with Dwight Powell and Salah Mejri's bum knees, along with Nerlens Noel's suspension. In fact, Motley looks like nearly a must-add player.

Barea has really struggled to stay healthy in his career, so this news isn't a surprise today. The Mavs were putting together some silly lineups in his loss, so it's tough to gauge who the pickups will be. It could be Yogi Ferrell, but he only played 17 minutes tonight.

             It's tank season and Harrison closed this game out. He's probably looking at minutes the rest of the way with J.J. Barea (oblique) possibly done for the year.

            Ian Clark (right ankle) is headed to the locker room.
        
        
             Clark went down hard after a missed layup, was on the ground for a bit and was unable to put any weight on his right leg as he was helped back to the locker room. It didn't look good, but we'll wait for an official update before speculating on what sort of timetable he'll be dealing with.

             He looked to have banged knees with Jamel Artis and went to the bench. Mejri was just getting over a right knee contusion and it's possible he was hit in a similar spot. Johnathan Motley is going to have to play a bunch tonight and possibly stick in the rotation.

             That's not good with one week left in the season. Barea could certainly be out for the rest of the season due to his ailment, which means Yogi Ferrell would get even more playing time. Expect to see plenty of Aaron Harrison tonight, as well.

             This is likely a matchup-based move against Memphis' small-ball lineup, and he'll be joined in the starting five by Rajon Rondo, Jrue Holiday, E'Twaun Moore and Anthony Davis. You might not recognize Mirotic if you tune into tonight's game, as he shaved his legendary beard on Wednesday morning.

             Wayne Selden (knee) is out an addition to the usuals (Tyreke Evans, Andrew Harrison and Mike Conley), so McLemore could be looking at quality minutes with the starting unit tonight and he could see a decent amount of shots falling his way. He's on the radar as a potential deep league streamer. Joining him in the starting five will be Kobi Simmons, Dillon Brooks, Jarell Martin and Marc Gasol.

            Terry Rozier (ankle) is questionable to play Wednesday against the Raptors.
        
        
             Rozier sat out Tuesday's game, which resulted in Kadeem Allen earning his first-career start, but he only managed to finish with two points, one rebound, two assists, one steal, one block and one turnovers across 23 minutes. Allen will likely remain the starter tonight if Rozier is forced to spend another game on the sidelines, but it'll be guys like Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown and Al Horford who will see the biggest boost in value sans Scary Terry. Stay tuned.

             The timing is pretty bad for Larkin because the Celtics could use him. With him out, it should be Kadeem Allen getting run, but the Celtics will likely run a lot of no-PG lineups.

             Available to play doesn't necessarily mean that Mejri will get out there tonight, and the Mavs may want to play it safe with him on the second night of a back-to-back. Basically, he's too risky to deploy in most settings. Johnathan Motley is getting the start at the five-spot tonight, and he's on the radar as a potential streamer.

             This is a tank-tastic lineup for the Mavs. McDermott should be taking plenty of shots in the game, so he could have a chance at 20 minutes. He won't do much else, but he is an option in DFS or as a points specialist.

             He did not travel for Tuesday's game and there's really not much talk of him progressing in the concussion protocol. Expect to see plenty of Josh Hart, Alex Caruso and a tight rotation on the wings. Ingram is a fairly easy drop in most leagues.

             This isn't much of a surprise after Dame said he has to be ""smart"" about his Tuesday ankle issue. The Blazers are basically locked in to the No. 3 spot, so Dame could miss additional games. Shabazz Napier should be added in basically all leagues and he will be a DFS play, too.

             This would get him on the postseason roster and it's almost a surprise that this hasn't happened just yet, but now the Warriors are running out of time. With Cook on the roster, it likely means Omri Casspi is going to be waived once the deal is official. Cook has already made 14 starts this season with 14.9 points per game, and it's certainly possible he gets several starts in the postseason.

             Mejri has been dealing with this knee issue for roughly a week now, and it wouldn't be surprising to see him sit on the second night of a back-to-back. If he is forced to the sidelines, the Mavs will be incredibly thin up front with Dirk Nowitzki (ankle), Dwight Powell (knee) and Harrison Barnes (rest) also out, so guys like Maxi Kleber and Jonathan Motley could get into the rotation tonight. Check back for official confirmation on Mejri's status closer to tip-off.

The majority of his minutes will be divvied up between Luc Mbah a Moute and P.J. Tucker, with Mbah a Moute likely moving into the starting five.

Paul is prone to the occasional cold shooting streaks, but he should turn things around soon enough.

            Dirk Nowitzki (ankle) is not traveling with the team on their three-game road trip, so he will not play Wednesday vs. the Magic.
        
        
             Nowitzki is dealing with pain in his left ankle, so it wouldn't be surprising to see the 39-year-old skip the entire trip. Harrison Barnes (rest), Dwight Powell (knee) and Dennis Smith Jr. (knee) will also sit out Wednesday's game, so guys like J.J. Barea and Yogi Ferrell figure to be very busy on offense tonight. Nowitzki can be cut in most leagues.

             Lopez was listed as questionable with a back issue, but he looked fine while he was out there, so he should be good to go for Wednesday's game against the Spurs.

             Williams struggled to get his shot to drop through much of the game, going 2-of-12 through the first three-quarters of play, but of course, he went human torch mode during the fourth racking up 15 of his 22 points on 6-of-8 shooting while rocking a 32.2 usage rate. In other words, he came through huge in the clutch, which is just par for the course for Sweet Lou.

             Williams was replaced by Sindarius Thornwell to begin the second half, and Thornwell finished with four points, three rebounds, two assists and two steals over 18 minutes. Neither of these guys has a consistent enough role with the Clippers to be worth dealing with in fantasy hoops.

             Wallace got the start with Danilo Gallinari (hand) out, and while he struggled offensively, he was able to add two rebounds, two assists, one steal and one block while he was out there. Wallace has been earning minutes in the mid-30s over the past four games, but he's only been able to chip in averages of 9.3 points, 4.5 boards, 1.5 dimes, 1.5 steals and 0.8 blocks per game on 39.5% shooting.

""We got to do our part,"" Rivers said prior to the game. ""At the end of the day I’m not even focused on what other teams do, I just want to go five-for-five and let’s see what happens."" One down, four to go.

             Harris added nine rebounds, one 3-pointer, three assists, two steals and three turnovers across 35 minutes, and he essentially single-handily kept the Clippers in the game early, helping them go on a huge 17-2 run during the second to erase a 19-point deficit. Harris did appear to tweak an ankle midway through the third, but he played through it without requiring a trip to the locker room, so he should be fine for Thursday's game in Utah.

             DJ was a force down low with his 29.8 rebounding rate, and his five offensive boards were huge for Los Angeles. He also did a really nice job of containing LaMarcus Aldridge on the other end of the floor, and with the win, the Clippers have kept their postseason hopes alive as they currently sit just 1.5 games out of the No. 8 spot out West.

The Spurs gave up 41 points through the final frame of action, which resulted in them dropping their sixth consecutive road game.

            Marquese Chriss scored six points with 13 rebounds, one block and two fouls in 27 minutes against the Kings on Tuesday.
        
        
             He kept his fouls down again and was productive on the defensive glass with all 13 coming on that end. Chriss has benefitted from the Suns missing so many players, so it looks like he could keep it going for the rest of the season. He'll burn you at some point, but he should be owned at this point.

             Fouls are becoming a problem for WCS, but he has been productive lately. In his last five, Cauley-Stein averaged 14.6 points, 7.0 boards, 2.8 assists, 1.0 steals and 0.8 blocks in his 26.6 minutes per game. The Kings will continue to sit other veterans, which should set up Trill for a big finish.

             That's just one off his career high from back on Mar. 22. Jackson was hot early in this game and missed a key shot late. Big game aside today, he did not score more than five points in his last three, so pretty much just throw this game out.

             It's been a rough go after a hot start for Fox and he continues to have a rough go in the first half of games. He's still skilled and the team loves him, so expect him to have a big season in his second year.

             Make it 10 straight games with 20-plus points for Donny. He's historically great as a scorer in his rookie season and he could be one of the best runner-up Rookie of the Year players of all time. Maybe he could win it, too. Regardless, Mitchell is going to be a monster for a long time.

             That's just the second time this season he has been over three assists. Gobert's blocks are back in a big way with seven in his last two games and he's also picked up double-digit boards in each of his last five games. He's more than made up his injury-plagued start.

             It's only the second time this season he's been over 30 points. Interestingly, the Jazz have gone 5-0 in the five games Rubio has scored more than 24 points this season, and he continues to show he can produce offense after the break. Rubio and the Jazz should be busy to close this season, and he's clearly over his hamstring soreness.

             The minutes were there, but the usage rate was tiny with his 3-of-4 from the line and from the field. Hart is going to see a lot of minutes to close out this season and he should run the offense a good amount.

             He should be set up for a lot of usage with Brandon Ingram out with a concussion. The Lakers have played him at small forward a lot lately and it's led to a lot of scoring for the rookie. He should have a huge finish this season.

             This came out of nowhere and coach Kenny Atkinson was kind of psyched about it after the game, saying Okafor ""helped his cause tonight,"" adding that ""he had some really good rolls, good plays."" Atkinson also indicated that Okafor played through some pain tonight, and it sounds like he might have earned some extra run down the stretch with this performance. Not that we trust him.

             This was a big loss for the Pacers, as they're now 1.5 games behind the Sixers for the No. 4 seed, and it looks like we're poised for the two to meet in Round 1, with the Sixers holding the homecourt advantage as of now. Then again, Philly could still catch the Cavs and push them into the No. 4 spot, where they'd face the Pacers. The playoff race is intense right now and will only get better over the final week of the season. Enjoy.

And the Pelicans are sandwiched in between the two, making Thursday's game one of the biggest of the season for all involved. And the icing on the cake will be watching the Jokic vs. Karl-Anthony Towns matchup that night, not too mention the potential of a Jimmy Butler return.

             This was a big win for the Nuggets, who closed to within a 1/2 game of the Pelicans, who currently hold the No. 8 seed in the West. Barton was a man possessed tonight, as was teammate Nikola Jokic, and they'll try to build on their three-game winning streak on Thursday against the Timberwolves. And considering that the Nuggets are just 1.0 games behind Minnesota, Thursday night should be a war with all hands on deck.

             He'll wear the mask the rest of the season and it might take him some time to get used to it. The good news is he played and shouldn't miss any time, but his numbers might suffer under the mask.

             Nerlens Noel is suspended for the rest of the season, Dwight Powell has been questionable for his last two games with knee soreness, so Mejri could get a start on Wednesday night if Powell sits. Then again, Mejri had missed his previous three games, so he's not a lock to play tonight, either. We should know a lot more about the center situation in Dallas on Wednesday afternoon.

             With Nerlens Noel suspended for the rest of the season, Powell and Salah Mejri are going to share the center load down the stretch. Mejri had five points, five boards and a block in 22 minutes and Powell has been the more reliable player up to this point. Powell's been questionable for his last couple games due to a sore knee, but he's played in both of them. If the Mavs choose to rest him tonight against Orlando, Mejri will be the way to go, obviously.

             JJB had been out for three games, but looked good tonight. And with Dennis Smith Jr. (knee) sitting out on Wednesday, JJB could have a big role against the Magic tonight. Yogi Ferrell will also see a boost with DSJ out, so make sure both of them are playing before making a decision. It's a coin toss as to which of them will have the better game on Wednesday, as both of them should be in the starting lineup.

             DSJ got off to a rocky start this season and really didn't even offer much fantasy value at one point, but has had a better second half, scoring in double figures in every game since a four-point dud on March 11 and averaging 16.4 points, 3.0 rebounds, 7.0 assists, 0.8 steals and 2.4 3-pointers on 45 percent shooting over his last five games.

             As if losing to the Mavericks during a playoff battle isn't bad enough, Lillard, who never left the game, had to be carted from the locker room to the team bus after the game. ""I think I have a pretty high pain tolerance but I’m going to be smart about it,"" he said after the game. ""It’s the end of the season, we’re going into playoffs so I have to be smart that one thing doesn’t turn into another."" The Blazers could potentially get caught by the Spurs, but are still the No. 3 seed with a 2.5 game lead as we type this. But with the Blazers in the playoffs either way, Lillard could end up resting his ankle for the rest of the regular season. And if that happens, you'll want to think about adding Shabazz Napier, who had 13 points and four assists tonight. We should know more on Wednesday and owners should be worried about Lillard's availability Thursday at Houston.

            Troy Daniels (right ankle sprain) will not return to Tuesday's game against the Kings.
        
        
             He went down just nine minutes into the game, missed his only shot and failed to record any other statistics. Depending on the severity of the sprain, this could be it for Daniels this season, which would translate to more burn for Danuel House. House is on the radar in deep leagues.

             With four regular-season games remaining, Markkanen is 14 three-pointers away from tying Dirk Nowitzki's single-season record for most triples by a seven-footer. He didn't turn the ball over in 24 minutes tonight, despite playing in full attack-mode offensively. When asked why he's been looking for his shot more, he cited the fact that Chicago was restricting him to around 24 minutes per game -- he might as well make them count.

             Bulls coach Fred Hoiberg said before the game that Robin Lopez could be shut down for the remainder of the season, but that plan could change if Noah Vonleh (strained calf) misses extra time. Either way, Felicio should have steady minutes in the 24-30 range each night. He hasn't contributed much more than rebounds lately, though, which limits his appeal.

            Russell Westbrook tried to put his team on his back and carry the Thunder to a win over the Warriors, but his 44 points, 16 rebounds, six assists, two steals and three 3-pointers weren't enough in the 111-107 loss.
        
        
             He was highly efficient tonight, hitting 15-of-26 shots and 11-of-12 free throws, but the Thunder just didn't make enough plays when it mattered to get by the Dubs. Westbrook's monster line might have helped win you a fantasy championship tonight, though. The loss hurt the Thunder, as they now sit at No. 6 in the West, tied with the No. 5 Jazz, a 1/2 game up on the No. 7 Wolves, and 1.0 games up on the No. 8 Pelicans. And they have a tough one on Saturday at Houston.

             When asked about his late-game explosion, Kilpatrick replied, ""It's an amazing feeling."" The journeyman guard added three assists and two blocks in 29 minutes of action, and could see plenty of run with Denzel Valentine (knee) done for the season. In his current role, he's best viewed as a cheap source of scoring and 3-pointers, with anything else as a bonus.

             Batum shot 2-of-9 from the field but was 6-of-7 from the stripe, and he committed just one turnover. He was supposed to be limited to around 20 minutes per game, and it's anyone's guess why he's risking further injury to a nagging Achilles injury -- the Hornets were eliminated from the playoff race over the weekend. If you're relying on him, you'll have to double-check his status prior to each game.

             Beat writers were speculating that he had a hip injury that forced him from the game, and while he didn't play all that well tonight, he was able to return to the game and get through it. The Thunder are off until Saturday, when they play the Rockets, so Adams should have plenty of time to get ready for that one. We're not going to put him on the injury list.

             Kemba played the final 6:42 tonight and Charlotte is still trying to win games, which bodes well for his fantasy value in the final three games. Part of his struggles tonight owed to a simple lack of opportunity -- he couldn't shoot his way into a rhythm because Charlotte committed 20 turnovers and took 18 fewer shots than Chicago. Plus, Malik Monk hogged all the offensive touches during a scintillating stretch in the fourth quarter.

The Hornets are refusing to rest their veterans and with just three games remaining they might stay the course. In his usual 24-30 minute role, though, Williams remains an erratic option best suited to roto leagues.

             The rookie is finally getting minutes for Charlotte and he's giving fans more reason to wonder why coach Steve Clifford kept him chained to the bench throughout a disappointing season. He was eventually out-dueled by Sean Kilpatrick late in this game, but not before throwing down a sweet double-pump baseline dunk (video below). Monk has scored at least 16 points in three straight games, despite limited minutes, and he's averaging 4.0 triples in that span. That's enough incentive to grab him.

             Ryan Anderson went down with a sprained ankle and didn't return and Green stayed hot, scoring in double figures for the sixth straight game. He's averaging 16.2 points, 4.8 rebounds, 1.4 assists, 0.8 steals and 3.2 3-pointers over his last five, and with Anderson's injury, should be able to keep it rolling over Houston's last four games.

             It's hard to imagine him not being named MVP and he might have sealed it with tonight's monster line. The Rockets have nothing left to play for, but Harden doesn't seem like he wants to sit out any games. Hopefully he's good to go for the next three games, but there's a real good chance he won't play in next Wednesday's season finale.

             CP3 had missed three of his previous four games and two straight, so some rust was to be expected. The Rockets have clinched home court throughout the playoffs and won easily tonight, so Paul could be facing some more rest going forward. But the Rockets also want to make sure he's in game shape heading into the playoffs, and the Rockets play again on Thursday, Saturday and Tuesday, before finishing up the season on Wednesday. Hopefully Paul plays in the next three and then gets a day off on the least day of the season.

             The Greek Freak got right to the rack with little resistance, and also had an incredible chase-down block on Jaylen Brown during the closing minutes of the game to help seal the deal for Milwaukee (link below). He's a stud and should continue to put up monster stat lines as the Bucks fight for seeding out East. John Henson finished with 11 points, four boards, one assist, one steal, three blocks and two turnovers in 28 minutes and he should be owned in most cases.

             Capela's vision was blurry for a short time after catching an elbow to the left eye, but when asked if he'd consider wearing goggles, he said no, adding that ""It's not 1984."" Capela was a beast tonight and has double-doubled in two straight games, and will look to keep it going on Thursday against the Blazers. Hopefully his eye is fine for that one. It should be, because it's clearly not 1984.

             Middleton had the hot hand early for Milwaukee, putting up 15 points through the first half of action without missing, and this was a nice bounce-back performance following Sunday's 4-of-18 shooting outing.

If Dedmon continues to sit, Muscala will be worth a fantasy look, and we prefer him over Plumlee regardless of who's starting.

            Kadeem Allen struggled with foul trouble through 23 minutes as a starter on Tuesday, finishing with two points, one rebound, two assists, one steal, one block and one turnover.
        
        
             Allen did have a few nice moments on the defensive end, but he struggled with his shot (1-of-4 shooting), and failed to take full advantage of the opportunity in front of him as the only healthy point guard on the roster. He could start again on Tuesday in Toronto if Terry Rozier (ankle) sits again, but he'll be a risky guy to deploy in most settings.

             Lee had just four points on Sunday, but had 20 points with two 3-pointers and two steals on Friday. The 10-day contracted Lee is worth a fantasy look as long as he keeps starting for the tanking Hawks.

             Brown added one 3-pointer, four rebounds, two assists, two steals, one block and three turnovers in the 36 minutes he was out there, and he did a really nice job of creating offense with his defense and getting to the rack. Unfortunately, the end result was a loss for the Celtics, putting an end to their six-game win streak.

             Prince hasn't been great in his last three games and is suddenly not trustworthy in fantasy, as the Hawks might feel that holding him back gives them a better chance of losing games. The only good news here is there are no initial reports of an injury.

             That gives him back-to-back double-doubles and he's hit double figures in rebounds in four of his last five. Dewayne Dedmon was out with a rib injury and Taurean Prince was benched after just 10 minutes, helping Collins' usage rate tonight.

             This is the first noise Artis has made this season and he could be primed for more minutes down the stretch, but given his track record, or lack thereof, he's going to be very difficult to trust the rest of the way. But he's definitely worth keeping an eye on for the Magic.

             He tried to go off tonight, but his shot wasn't cooperating. Gordon's shot is a mess right now, as he hit just 13-of-48 over his last three games. Maybe he'll break out of the shooting funk on Wednesday against the lowly Mavericks.

He's worth using the rest of the way, as he's been doing this consistently since going to the Sixers in February.

             There it is. We've been waiting for Holmes to go off in the absence of Joel Embiid and it happened tonight, even though he's coming off the bench. If you picked him up for your championship run, it looks like he's going to come through. Or, at least he did tonight. He was iffy with a sprained ankle, making his line even more impressive.

             It wasn't a triple-double, but it was another great line from the probable Rookie of the Year. The Sixers are clinging to the No. 4 seed in the East and are breathing down the necks of the No. 3 Cavaliers, who beat the Raptors tonight. Simmons and the Sixers are a sleeper team to watch in the playoffs.

             Ghostface Ilya has double-doubled in two of his last three games and if Dario Saric continues to miss time with his elbow injury, Ilyasova could keep it going. He's a sneaky fantasy play in all formats for as long as Saric is out.

            Noah Vonleh exited Tuesday's game with a strained left calf and he will not return.
        
        
             Vonleh will end his evening with three rebounds and nothing else through seven scoreless minutes off the bench, and for now, we'll be considering him questionable for Friday's game in Boston. Vonleh isn't worth owning in most leagues, but if he needs to miss time, maybe Lauri Markkanen will start seeing some fourth-quarter minutes again.

             He came in hot, scoring in double figures in 12 straight games and racking up boards and other stats along the way. He's dealing with a facial laceration and tonight's game was a blowout loss, which is likely the reason his minutes were so down. Hopefully he bounces back on Thursday against the Bucks.

             He couldn't miss early and easily outplayed Kyle Lowry in a revenge game of sorts. The Cavs need to keep winning in order to hold off the Sixers and took care of the East's No. 1 seed tonight. If George Hill (ankle) continues to miss games, maybe Calderon will finish the season on a high note, but he won't be playing against his former team every night, so don't hold your breath.

             Yuck. Jose Calderon ran circles around Lowry tonight in a weird revenge game, while Lowry may or may not have been struggling because he was at the NCAA Championship Game in San Antonio on Monday night. Either way, he did not have a good game and the Raptors weren't able to stop the Cavs, but still hold a 2.0 game over the Celtics for the top seed in the East, although that will change if Boston beats the Bucks tonight.

             Gallinari aggravated his fractured hand during a fall on Sunday, and said afterward that it left him in ""constant pain"" during the game. L.A.'s most recent loss eliminated their slim playoff hopes, so it's no real surprise to see him get a DNP tonight. He's probably done for the season, but we'll consider him day-to-day until L.A. provides an update.

            Ryan Anderson went down with a sprained left ankle and limped to the locker room on Tuesday, and he will not return.
        
        
             He played just five minutes before getting hurt and missed his only shot. Anderson has missed more games than he's played since the All-Star break, so there's a good chance Houston rests him a while to ensure he's ready for the playoffs. His absence would likely just mean more opportunities for guys like P.J. Tucker, Luc Mbah a Moute, Gerald Green and Eric Gordon.

             The veteran was down for a few minutes and waived off Amir Johnson's initial attempt to help him get up. He didn't put weight on the leg while leaving and although we'll reserve judgement about the severity, the Nets have nothing to gain by rushing him back at the end of the season. Rondae Hollis-Jefferson, Dante Cunningham even Quincy Acy should pick up minutes if Carroll misses games.

             Harris has been out with a knee injury and if he misses two more games in addition to Tuesday night, he'd only have a shot to play in Denver's two final games of the season. In other words, your season is probably going to be over before he plays another game for the Nuggets, who might also see their season end early if they don't make a final playoff push. Right now they're the No. 9 seed in the West, a game behind the No. 8 Pelicans.

Thus, it's a gut punch for fantasy owners who left Dedmon in their starting lineup and will get a bunch of zeros as a result. Miles Plumlee will draw the start at center, but doesn't present much fantasy upside. We will likely have to wait until after the game to get an explanation on what happened with Dedmon, as well as his status going forward.

             Dedmon has been playing well and could still have a nice game off the bench, but this is an odd move for the East's worst team. The Hawks play a disgruntled Hassan Whiteside and the Heat, and at this point, owners of Dedmon just have to hope Dedmon will play off the bench. Plumlee is not really a fantasy asset, even if starting.

             Neto has not played since March 11th when he fractured his wrist, but has reportedly made progress in his rehab of late. However, even when he's back healthy in the lineup, he has very limited fantasy value. Leave him on waivers.

             Batum was initially ruled out earlier this morning, then upgraded to questionable, and we now learn he will start vs. Chicago. However, he should be avoided in DFS, due to his minute's restriction. With Batum limited to 20 minutes, Jeremy Lamb will see an uptick in playing time off the bench.

Allen is someone to consider tossing out there as a DFS punt play or deep league streamer, and guys like Jayson Tatum and Al Horford will spend more time than usual running the offense.

However, with Green ruled out 24 hours ahead of Wednesday's contest, with two full days off, it appears Green may be sidelined for multiple games, which makes him difficult to hold onto in leagues that are deciding their championship over the next eight days. Jarell Martin and Ivan Rabb will likely soak up most of Green minutes on Wednesday.

            Cristiano Felicio will return to the starting lineup on Tuesday vs. Charlotte, sending Robin Lopez back to the bench.
        
        
             Felicio tends to play a bit better when running with the first unit, so he could be a low-end streamer in deep leagues tonight. Joining him in the starting five will be Cameron Payne, Justin Holiday, David Nwaba and Lauri Markkanen. Lopez is a non-option in all leagues.

             Harris has been shooting the lights out over the past three, hitting 56.0% of his attempts on his way to averages of 14.0 points, 1.7 triples, 1.7 dimes and just 1.7 turnovers per contest, so he's on the radar as a potential DFS punt play or streamer with some more minutes falling his way tonight. Nik Stauskas should also see some more playing time, but Harris is the more attractive target here.

             Love skipped shootaround with the illness, but he'll gut it out for this one with the Cavs fighting for seeding. Love has been struggling with his shot as of late, and might not be quite 100% tonight, so he's a risky DFS play with a tough matchup against Toronto. He's safe to fire up in all season-long settings, though.

Lee has been trending down over the final few months with New York going full tank mode, so he belongs on the wire in most formats.

Beasley had been averaging 27.0 points per game over New York's last three contests, so there will a lot of shots up for grabs in NY, which should benefit Trey Burke and Tim Hardaway. Lance Thomas and Isaiah Hicks should soak up most of Beasley's minutes at power forward.

KQO is expected to draw another start and is worth consideration as a streamer if you are looking for boards. Luke Kornet should see about 15-18 minutes off the bench as well.

             To be clear, Saric is out for tonight's game due to ""cellulitis"" in his right elbow, which is basically a skin infection, and it seems like they're just being cautious holding him out tonight on the first leg of a back-to-back set given it's a matchup with the 25-52 Nets. Ersan Ilyasova will earn another start tonight, and he's someone to think about streaming.RotoGrinders.com Daily Slant: Ersan Ilyasova started at PF in Saric's absence on Sunday and we saw Amir Johnson with a notable uptick in playing time (31 mins vs. CHA), so both players get large value upticks as a result. Johnson remains a volatile target, but Ilyasova is viable in any format. Ben Simmons also gets a 6.1% boost in usage and scores almost six additional fantasy points per 36 minutes with Embiid and Saric off the floor.

""I know that just looking from afar, [the Bucks] will be fine. But I just have to see what’s going to happen with my future, and that’s uncertain. But I know for them, they’ll be fine regardless. They’ve been doing well."" As good as Parker is, and as impressive as his recovery from the second ACL tear has been, he's not really a perfect fit in Milwaukee, so the Bucks might let him walk if another team comes around with a max offer.

If he's forced to sit again, Tyus Jones will earn another start and he'll be a very attractive streamer. Stay tuned.

            Jimmy Butler (knee surgery) implied that he's very close to getting back to the court.
        
        
             This was Butler's first full practice since undergoing knee surgery back on February, 25, and the second day in a row he's participated in full-contact work, which is a very encouraging sign regarding his impending return. Butler did acknowledge that he'll likely have a minutes limit upon his return, and it will ultimately be up to the Timberwolves' medical staff as to when exactly that happens, but he should only need a handful more of full-contact practices before he's cleared.

             Rozier said he was ""for sure"" going to play on Monday and was upgraded to probable after getting through shootaround this morning, so this is quite the 180. Brad Stevens is going to have to get creative at the point guard spot with Kyrie Irving (knee) and Shane Larkin (illness) also out. Kadeem Allen could get some serious burn, as could Abdel Nader as the last men standing in Boston's backcourt, and guys like Jayson Tatum and Al Horford will handle the ball more. For now, we'll consider Rozier questionable for Wednesday's game against the Raptors.

             Valentine played well for most of March, but saw his minutes and production decrease late in the month. The Bulls have now shut down Valentine, Kris Dunn (toe) and Zach LaVine (knee) for the season. Chicago has continued to mix-and-match lineups, so it's difficult to predict who will be the primary beneficiary with Valentine sidelined. David Nwaba, Justin Holiday and Sean Kilpatrick will all likely see an uptick in minutes.

             Coach Luke Walton said that Ball's knee is still bothering him and that ""with so few games left in the season, he won’t play until it doesn’t hurt."" The Lakers will continue to err on the side of caution with their prized rookie point guard. After Wednesday, L.A. will have just four games left this season. It's possible we've seen the last of Ball in 2017-18. Alex Caruso and Josh Hart will continue to split minutes at PG.RotoGrinders.com Daily Slant: Alex Caruso is still with the team and will more than likely draw the start at point guard once again after logging at least 29 minutes in each of the last two games, though he's yet to flash much fantasy upside on either occasion. With Brandon Ingram still sidelined, Kyle Kuzma should continue to start at small forward, and he's logged 39 minutes or more in all but one of the last six games, raising his floor and ceiling on a nightly basis.

             Isaac returned to the Magic's lineup over the weekend, only to injure his left ankle in Sunday's loss to Atlanta. Isaac has shown promise during his rookie campaign, but has been unable to stay healthy. Tuesday's contest will be the 50th game he's missed this season due to foot/ankle issues. Mario Hezonja will soak up additional playing time with Isaac sidelined.

             Batum was initially ruled out Tuesday morning, prior to shootaround. However, he is feeling better and apparently was able to participate. The Hornets-Bulls game tips off at 8:00 pm EST, so we will get an update on Batum's status at approximately 6:30 pm, when coach Steve Clifford addresses the media. If Batum is unable to play, Jeremy Lamb (foot), who is listed as probable, will likely draw the start in place of Batum.

             Warren has not played since March 17th and doesn't appear to be making much meaningful progress. Josh Jackson soaked up most of the minutes Warren left behind and has posted some very impressive stats. Over his last eight games, Jackson is averaging 22.0 points, 5.1 rebounds, 3.5 assists, 2.0 steals and 0.5 blocks.

             Booker has missed each of the Suns last seven games due to a right hand sprain. The Suns haven't provided many details or updates on Booker's condition. Phoenix is currently on pace to finish with the league's worst record, which would give them the best odds to land the No. 1 overall pick in the 2018 draft lottery. Thus, they have no motivation to rush Booker back into the lineup. Troy Daniels and Josh Jackson will continue to soak up minutes if Booker is ruled out.

             Lopez has been a regular on the injury report with a probable tag, so this is notable. He's been a fantasy stud in recent weeks, but he's coming off a down game with just nine points on 3-of-8 shooting vs. the Kings. If Lopez can't go, we should get an extended look at second-year center Ivica Zubac, but the matchup is brutal.

             The Players' Tribune posted a video on Monday of Hayward jogging up and down the court, which is the first real on-court activity we've seen him do since suffering the injury, and this is an improvement from being confined to the AlterG anti-gravity treadmill. That said, considering Hayward just started light jogging, we seriously doubt he'll be back at any point this year.

             This is a huge step, and if Butler can get in a few more full-contact, 5-on-5 practices without experiences a setback, there's a chance he could get back to the court for Thursday's game in Denver. Officially, he remains without an official timetable, though, so he's a risky guy to stash with the limited information we have.

            Gary Harris (knee) will not suit up for Tuesday's game against the Pacers, as expected.
        
        
             Mike Malone said that Harris was still ""a ways away"" on Friday, so there's a good chance he'll sit out all three games this week. Will Barton will continue to start in his absence, with Jamal Murray seeing an uptick in usage. If Harris does miss this week, that would give him a max of just two games left on the year, so he's not really worth hanging onto in re-draft formats.

             Chandler sat out Sunday's win over Milwaukee, which resulted in Torrey Craig drawing the start, but he did a whole lot of nothing through his 36 minutes of floor time. Trey Lyles and Juan Hernangomez will also have the opportunity for some extended run if Chandler is out again, but there's not a clear add here in fantasy hoops.

             Kupchak was part of a Lakers' front office staff that put together five championship rosters, but he also made a lot of failed free agency pitches during his final years with the club and signed Luol Deng (four years, $72 million) and Timofey Mozgov (four years, $64 million) to horrendously awful contracts on his way out the door. It sounds like the job in Charlotte is his for the taking, and he'll have his hands full if he wants to get the Hornets back to being a playoff team again.

He appears to be locked in as the Bulls point guard of the future and had a nice bounce-back season with averages of 13.6 points, 6.3 assists, 4.2 rebounds, 2.0 steals, 0.6 blocks, 1.1 triples and 2.5 turnovers in 43 starts.

             Fantasy owners could see this coming from miles away and the Bulls are just confirming the inevitable. This will allow them to be extra cautious with LaVine's knee and it's obvious that they would like to improve their draft lottery position. The Bulls used a 12-man rotation in their last game and Denzel Valentine is ice cold with a combined 15 points over his last three games, so most owners will want to avoid this mess.

             He rolled his left ankle late in Sunday's  loss to the Hawks, but the good news is that this isn't the same ankle that's bothered him for most of the season. Still, his durability has been a legitimate concern this season. If Isaac can't go, that means we should see more of Mario Hezonja and he does have some intrigue with a four-game week.

             This is a tough blow for Boston because Terry Rozier (ankle) is their last point guard standing and he's currently considered questionable.

             Rozier will not practice on Monday and the Celtics could be in a little trouble with Shane Larkin (illness) already ruled out. Jayson Tatum ran a lot of offense for Boston in their last game, so expect more of the same if Rozier can't go. Jaylen Brown should also get more run and the Celtics may need to rely on rookie PG Jabari Bird. For what it's worth, Rozier said he's planning to play.

             His back has been an issue before this season but the wrist is a new injury. The Knicks have no incentive to win games, so we'd expect them to be cautious and hold the big man out. Kyle O'Quinn appears to be the primary beneficiary if Kanter sits and is coming off an eight-point game with 15 rebounds, three assists and one block on Saturday. Luke Kornet will likely pick up the backup center minutes, but played just 16 minutes on Saturday.

             He's expected back after a one-game absence. Courtney Lee (foot) is also probable, but Ntilikina should get the bulk of the minutes if he's feeling up to it. The rookie is starting to make some nice progress on the court, but is still hard to trust in fantasy leagues with 7.5 points, 3.5 rebounds, 2.0 assists, 0.8 steals and 0.6 triples in 25.0 minutes over his last four outings.

             The Knicks have been cautious with Lee in recent weeks and his minutes have plummeted since the All-Star break with the team taking an extended look at their young talent. The Knicks will be missing quite a few player on Tuesday and Michael Beasley (questionable) and Enes Kanter (doubtful) may not play, so maybe Lee picks up some extra minutes. There should still be a better option on your waiver wire with 13 games on Tuesday.

Beasley has been on fire and is a must-start player when active with averages of 27.0 points, 6.7 rebounds, 2.3 assists, 0.7 blocks, 0.7 steals and 1.7 triples over his last three games. Lance Thomas and Isaiah Hicks would be candidates to pick up the slack if Beasley can't go, but Thomas isn't a fantasy option no matter what.

""You’d have more information if he had a training camp and he had a longer time period, he’d be much more acclimated."" Okafor has only played in three out of Brooklyn's 18 games since the break and it's becoming obvious that he'll end up somewhere else as a free agent.

""He's done a good job scoring all year and he's started to figure out how to respond for us a little bit."" Gay had 21 points on 9-of-13 shooting Sunday with three rebounds, two steals, one block and zero turnovers in 24 minutes, his fourth game of the season with 20+ points. It doesn't sound like Kawhi Leonard (quad) will be back anytime soon, so Gay may be asked to become San Antonio's second option on offense to complement LaMarcus Aldridge.

Even if he plays in each of Golden State's five remaining games, there's a good chance the Warriors will limit his minutes along with their other studs.

            Kings big man Jack Cooley grabbed a career-high eight rebounds in 16 minutes off the bench on Sunday, adding three points without any other stats.
        
        
             Cooley went 1-of-3 from the field and 1-of-2 from the line, and would be a total gamble in fantasy leagues even if Zach Randolph (illness) and Skal Labissiere (ankle) miss time. For now, just keep an eye on the Kings' injury report.

             WCS also got hit with a technical foul for complaining to the refs, but he played through his frustration to salvage some fantasy value. He's picked up the scoring lately and is shooting a combined 25-of-34 (73.5%) over the past four games, but he's been annoyingly vacant in the defensive categories since mid-March.

             It's not what Hart's owners wanted to see after Friday's strong double-double in 35 minutes, but we'll give him a pass. L.A.'s offense was stuck in mud tonight without Lonzo Ball (knee) and Brandon Ingram (concussion), and as a team they shot 40.0% with 14 turnovers and 18 assists. With four games on the schedule this week, Hart is still a viable plug-and-play if he's on your wire.

             Zubac grabbed four of his boards on the offensive end, and helped spur a strong bench effort to keep L.A. in the game -- they still lost to the visiting Kings. That's two strong games for Zubac and it would be fun to see him unleashed, but that can only happen if Brook Lopez (nine points in 26 minutes) gets shut down.

That left Brooks free to launch shots at will, but the key is that he contributed more than just scoring. If he can consistently contribute more 3-pointers, steals and boards, his fantasy stock will increase in a hurry. It's something to watch during the preseason.

             Durant also added 11 rebounds and eight assists with two blocked shots, falling just two dimes short of the triple-double. It was a nice outing against the defensively-challenged Suns. He'll get a crack against the Thunder in his old stomping grounds in what is always an emotional return to Oklahoma City on Tuesday evening.

He looks better than ever in his two games since returning from a fractured right thumb, averaging 24.0 points with 2.5 3-pointers and 1.5 steals per game. Get him back in the active fantasy lineup immediately if you haven't already done so.

             The Nuggets' 27-year-old rookie was making his fifth start of the season, with his previous starts yielding minimal fantasy value -- 9.8 points, 1.8 threes, 4.0 rebounds, 1.3 assists, 0.8 blocks and 0.5 steals. His defense was impressive but it's hard to envision him helping fantasy owners, especially since Chandler could return as soon as Tuesday.

             Mike Malone said recently that Murray is putting too much pressure on himself without Gary Harris (knee), so it must have felt amazing to calmly drain all three freebies with under seconds remaining. He went 7-of-15 from the field and 10-of-10 at the line in 36 minutes. Prior to the game, coach Mike Malone implored Murray to shoot at will. ""Stop dribbling so much,"" he said. ""You're a shooter. If you're open, shoot it."" He had been slumping so hopefully this game will lift his spirits -- and his FG%.

             It's not a great line, but Hernangomez and the second unit injected some life into this game for Denver. He was only in the rotation because Wilson Chandler was out with a nasal fracture, and Chandler's uncertain timetable makes it tough to recommend Juancho anywhere.

The center position is a fantasy wasteland for the Dubs, whether it is Bell, Looney or Zaza Pachulia holding it down in the middle. If you absolutely need to start one, Bell is the best bet.

             It was all for naught, as the Bucks fell 128-125 in overtime. Parker took over this game for stretches and the playing time was a stunner -- it's the first time all season that he's played more than 30 minutes in a game. It's unfortunate that his breakout came with just five games left on the schedule, but at least we're reminded of his sky-high potential when healthy. He'll face a stiffer defense vs. the visiting Celtics on Tuesday.

             This just wasn't Middleton's night. In addition to the poor shooting, he threw away an inbounds pass with 5.0 seconds remaining, which led to three game-tying free throws from Jamal Murray. At least Middleton chipped in elsewhere to help fantasy owners, and one of his makes came from downtown. That snapped a streak of 12 consecutive games with multiple triples, but we're guessing he'll start a new streak on Tuesday.

            Danuel House went for a career-high 16 points across 34 minutes off the bench in Sunday's loss at Golden State.
        
        
             On a positive note, House was able to beat Draymond Green on a baseline bucket for a three-point play. On a negative note, he passed it to himself off the backboard for a dunk in the second quarter with the team up by seven. That kind of hot-dogging seemed to be the alarm clock that woke up the defending champs, as they turned a nine-point deficit at the time into a 10-point victory.

             Ulis was able to roll up 42 minutes with Devin Booker and Elfrid Payton on the shelf. Despite the solid effort the Suns were unable to avoid their franchise record 15th consecutive loss. They'll try to get back into the win column on Tuesday night when the Kings pay a visit in the Tank Bowl.

             Skal finishes with six points, nine rebounds and one steal. He was wearing a walking boot in the locker room and owners will have to wait for updates to assess whether he could miss more games -- Sacramento plays on Tuesday, then has off until Friday. If he does miss time, guys like JaKarr Sampson and Jack Cooley should help fill the void.

             Chriss has rolled to double-digit point totals in a career-high eight straight outings, as he is finally starting to snap out of his season-high funk. It's just in time to rebuild his fantasy value heading into next season. Hopefully he doesn't disappoint in 2018-19 like he did this season. He is averaging 13.5 points with 8.0 rebounds with 1.2 blocked shots during the impressive eight-game run.

             Bender has managed just 10 or more points in the past 20 games, but he opened this game with 11 points in the first quarter. The rest of the game was a bit disappointing as far as the points, but the double-double and the good overall stat line was much needed. He and his teammates will look to keep up the good offensive work on Tuesday against the equally lowly Kings.

             Clark was very efficient, hitting 6-of-7 from the field while going a perfect 3-of-3 from behind the 3-point line and 1-of-1 from the free-throw stripe. He has hit double figures in points seven times across the past 12 outings. Despite the uptick in offense his fantasy value is limited to the very deepest of leagues as long as Rajon Rondo (wrist) is healthy.

That was true, as he logged a team-best 40 minutes while grabbing 11 rebounds, three assists, three steals and two blocked shots. The team has six more regular-season contests remaining.

             The Jazz have won 14 of their last 15 games on the road and much of their success stems from the pairing of Favors and Rudy Gobert, who have found a way to co-exist. Favors was coming off a strong month of March in which he averaged 11.6 points on 63.1% shooting, and he did it again tonight with a 6-of-9 mark from the field. He's stayed healthy, which is the key, and has made himself a viable late-round target in fantasy after threatening to become irrelevant.

             O'Neale earned a spot start with Ricky Rubio (hamstring) out Friday, but resumed his typical bench role tonight. He's a pesky defender who fits Utah's team well, but there's no fantasy value to be found here.

            Ricky Rubio (left hamstring soreness) got the last laugh vs. the Wolves on Sunday, scoring 23 points on 9-of-14 shooting with seven rebounds, three assists, one steal and a season-high five 3-pointers.
        
        
             This was a critical game vs. a Conference opponent, which just happened to be Rubio's former team, so there was almost no way he was sitting out. He came one shy of his career-high for 3-pointers in a game, and one shy of the Wolves' total as a team tonight -- if revenge is what he wanted, he got it. His hamstring looked fine, obviously, but it can't hurt to confirm his status prior to Tuesday's home game.

             Exum was coming off a 21-point gem vs. the Grizzlies and he continues to shine -- the only difference is that his minutes dropped off with Ricky Rubio (hamstring) back in the starting lineup. As long as Rubio and Donovan Mitchell are both active, it'll be hard for Exum to have more than deep-league appeal.

             The Jazz rolled over the lackluster Wolves tonight, 121-97, and the starters were able to rest down the stretch. Far from hitting the rookie wall, Mitchell is running right through it with 20+ points in nine consecutive games. That's the longest such streak in Jazz history (Darrell Griffith), and the No. 13 pick continues to shine as one of the steals of the 2017 draft.

             Grant was a perfect 5-of-5 from the field and 2-of-2 from the free-throw line while adding two blocked shots, a rebound and a steal.

             George hit just 9-of-24 from the field, and 3-of-11 from behind the 3-point line, as he is now just 28.6 percent from downtown since the All-Star break.

Westbrook still has never had a full month in the NBA shooting north of 50 percent.

Tonight's line wasn't a total loss in roto leagues, since he hit his marks in rebounds and defensive stats without hurting your FT%.

             Cleveland has won eight of their past nine games, and they took tonight's game vs. Dallas despite LeBron shooting just 5-of-21 from the field -- his lowest mark in a regular-season game since Mar. 2008. The race for homecourt advantage is still too close for comfort for the Cavs, so LeBron should be ready to carry his team in matchups vs. the Raptors, Wizards and 76ers this week.

             Love shot 4-of-13 from the field and 3-of-5 from the line, but this was a step in the right direction after Friday's foul-plagued dud. With his recent concussion in the rearview mirror, he's once again a top-50 machine for fantasy owners -- and with tonight's effort, he became the seventh active player with 400+ double-doubles in his career.

             Calderon logged 22 minutes and that's typical for his role even when Cleveland is short-handed. He's a reliable complementary player who doesn't demand usage, and the move also allowed Jordan Clarkson and J.R. Smith to stay together as sparkplugs for the second unit. There's no reason to touch Calderon even if Hill misses more time.

             Dorsey was on fire, going 8-of-11 from the field, including 3-of-5 from behind the 3-point line. One of those triples was a bank shot early on, which gave him extra confidence. ""He banked in his first (three-point attempt), and then he thought he was hot,"" head coach Mike Budenholzer joked. Dorsey has double-digit point totals in five of his past six outings, his most prolific scoring stretch of the season. With Dennis Schroder done for the season, Dorsey will see plenty of minutes down the stretch.

             Bembry missed more than five weeks due to an abdominal injury, and this was his first game since Feb. 23. ""Being healthy is probably the most important things,"" Hawks coach Mike Budenholzer said. ""We will ease him in pretty lightly. He will play short stretches, and hopefully a few of them. He's a natural player. He has an instinct for both ends of the court, especially defensively. Weould just like to see him be confident and comfortable out there."" Well, he did a good job in this one, but won't have much time to get comfortable before the curtain closes on the 2017-18 NBA campaign.

             The bench unit eroded Crabbe's playing time tonight, resulting in his fewest minutes since Dec. 27. Joe Harris was solid with 15 points on 6-of-12 shooting, Caris LeVert added 10 points and seven assists, and even Nik Stauskas got into the act with three points in 10 minutes. Crabbe has been in an offensive slump lately anyway, and even if the dip in minutes was temporary, most owners don't have the luxury to wait and find out.

He's also dished more assists (249) than any Nets bench player since Marcus Williams in 2006-07, per Nets PR, which is another indication of his versatility. He's still 23 years old and his long-term fantasy prospects are tantalizing.

            Anthony Tolliver notched his first double-double of the season on Sunday with 10 points, 12 rebounds, two steals and one assist.
        
        
             Tolliver hit a pair of 3-pointers and there were a few more boards available with Andre Drummond ejected late. Blake Griffin (ankle) will be reevaluated in early April but the Pistons' window of playoff viability is rapidly closing -- they've won five straight games, but still trail Miami by 4.0 games. Once they're mathematically eliminated, the 32-year-old Tolliver could find himself sitting more often than not.

            Ish Smith went off vs. Brooklyn on Sunday, making 7-of-8 shots for 17 points, two 3-pointers, two assists, one steal and one rebound in just 17 minutes of action.
        
        
             He was 7-of-7 in the first half alone, but eventually took a backseat to Reggie Jackson. Smith came in shooting 43.2% from deep over his past 28 games, way above his career average 29.4%, which is an interesting wrinkle to watch during the offseason. He and Jackson are both under contract next season, though, and it's hard to envision Ish being drafted in standard leagues while R-Jax is locked into the starting PG job.

             Gordon has reached 10 or more points in 52 games this season. He continues to be a reliable source of offense on a team that isn't very good. The point total wasn't great, but he has been sharp in each of his six games since returning from injury. Gordon is averaging 16.3 points, 7.5 rebounds and 1.3 steals per game in his six outings since March 20.

             Isaac actually hit the mark with 9:09 left in the third quarter and he didn't score another point after that. He could have had an even bigger night, but fantasy owners of the rookie cannot complain too vehemently. Head coach Frank Vogel recently said he wants to play Isaac next to Aaron Gordon as much as possible, and that's coming into fruition. Isaac is playing a larger role down the stretch and his fantasy value is increasing.

             Iwundu had missed the past two games due to illness. The return of Iwundu pushed Rodney Purvis back to the bench. Iwundu was good for just 2-of-6 from the field, including 1-of-2 from downtown, while adding two assists, a rebound, a steal and a blocked shot. He remains useful only in the very deepest of fantasy leagues and as a low-cost punt play in DFS. Next up is a trip to New York on Tuesday.

He also had a respectable seven rebounds and three assists with no turnovers. It was his 37th time scoring in double digits this season. He'll look to carry over the momentum into Tuesday's game in New York. He has struggled against the Knicks this season, averaging just 8.0 points per game in two outings.

             Vucevic's overall stat line was good enough for his fantasy owners, but he had an abysmal 3-of-19 shooting performance to cross those in 9-cat leagues needing a big day for field-goal percentage. Hey, at least he was 4-of-4 from the free-throw line. He'll be back at it Tuesday in New York. The 27-year-old Swiss center has torn up the Knicks for 25.7 points, 7.7 rebounds and 1.7 blocked shots per outing in three meetings against them this season.

             Davis has been walking without a boot and without a limp, but his right ankle is still very swollen. While he is very optimistic that he'll be able to return sooner rather than later, his optimism means nothing until he is officially re-evaluated by the team. Fantasy owners should make plans to be without him for a few games, and perhaps longer, as the Blazers likely want to make sure he is 100 percent for their playoff run. Zach Collins will continue to take on a larger role behind Jusuf Nurkic until Davis is cleared to return.

He said he was exhausted after playing 35 minutes Friday against the Bucks in his return from a fractured left hand, but hopefully he did some cardio since then. He is in for another night of heavy lifting.

            Quincy Acy was ejected from Sunday's game against the Pistons near the end of the third quarter after a fracas with Andre Drummond.
        
        
             Acy also inadvertently hit the ref in the face going after Andre Drummond, so there might be more disciplinary coming for Acy outside of just the ejection. His wallet is likely to be lighter and he might face a potential suspension. He ended up scoreless in just four minutes, going 0-of-4 from the field with a rebound, yet still ended up a plus-5. It was a disappointment after his 13-point effort on Saturday in Miami.

             Casspi will miss his eighth consecutive game due to a sprained right ankle. He was listed as questionable for this one, but just isn't quite ready to return. With Kevin Durant, Draymond Green and Klay Thompson healthy back to playing, even when Casspi is healthy enough to play he'll be fighting for scraps and will have minimal fantasy appeal.

             He was doubtful to play, so it's not at all surprising to see him spending his second straight game on the sidelines. Kevin Durant and Draymond Green will play a bit more with Iguodala out, and Nick Young could pick up some extra run with the second unit, but that doesn't mean much. For now, we'll be considering Iguodala questionable for Tuesday's game in OKC.

             Gay provided a nice spark off the bench in this one, scoring a quick 10 points on 4-of-6 shooting upon entering the game, and he also had a really nice effort on the defensive end of the floor. Gay was working with a larger than usual usage rate of 30.2, and the small-ball, uptempo Rockets created a good matchup for him. That said, he's not going to hit 69.2% of his attempts on most nights and he's been too up-and-down this season to trust in most settings.

Still, Gasol’s minutes are far too inconsistent to bother with him in most leagues.

             Aldridge did a really nice job cleaning up the glass on defense with his 30.6 defensive rebounding rate, and the Rockets didn’t really have any answers for him, as he finished 11-of-19 from the field and 1-of-1 from the stripe. With the win, the Spurs are now just 2.5 games back from the No. 3 seed out West and they have a one-game advantage over Minnesota for the No. 4 spot. It looks like the Spurs will make the postseason after all.

With a 2.5-game deficit and just five games left, they have no realistic shot. Before the game he described his status as ""Like it's been. Day-to-day."" Fantasy owners should confirm his status before trusting him in DFS or weekly lineups.

He doesn't plan to miss any games, however, saying, ""I can't sit out, we need wins."" The Clippers' backcourt has become progressively thinner without Patrick Beverley, Avery Bradley, Jawun Evans and Milos Teodosic, so they'll continue to lean heavily on Rivers as long as possible.

             Anderson played some phenomenal defense against James Harden, and as an added bonus for 9-cat owners, he finished the game without a single turnover.

            Danny Green scored 12 points on 3-of-11 shooting on Sunday, to go with two 3-pointers, seven rebounds, two steals, two blocks and one turnover through 30 minutes as a starter.
        
        
             Green got off to a rough start in this one, going 1-of-7 from the field through the first half of action, but his solid defense helped him stay on the floor and he came through with some big plays down the stretch for the Spurs. He’s inconsistent, but there’s nothing wrong with owning him as a shot blocking and 3-point specialist in deep leagues. Patty Mills finished with 14 points, three triples, five boards and four assists in 37 minutes, and he's also worth owning as a 3-point specialist.

            Montrezl Harrell made the second 3-pointer of his career on Sunday, going 9-of-12 from the field for 19 points with three rebounds and two assists in 21 minutes.
        
        
             Harrell's efficiency and per-minute scoring are incredible, and his strong play could create problems for L.A. since he's headed into restricted free agency. He continues to log around 18-22 minutes per game as the Clippers chase a playoff berth, so keep using him if you're in search of points and FG%.

             Harris rounded out his line with four rebounds, one steal and one block, but it wasn't enough to avoid a costly loss to the Pacers. L.A. drops to 2.5 games behind the Jazz and Pelicans, who are in a virtual tie for the final playoff spots. For the next few games, at least, the Clippers' veterans should continue to get a full allotment of minutes.

             Murray went right at James Harden on offense, taking on a more aggressive role than usual with his 33.5 usage rate (up from 20.6), and he did an excellent job harassing the Houston players on the other end of the floor. Murray isn’t really a pass-first point guard, so he doesn’t often offer much in the way of dimes, but his solid rebounding totals from the guard position partnered with elite steals numbers makes him worth owning in most leagues.

             Rubio tested his hamstring during warmups and obviously felt good enough to go in a critical game for the Jazz. Make sure he's back in your active lineups vs. his former team tonight. With Rubio active, Royce O'Neale should head back to the bench and Dante Exum's role will get slashed.

             Capela had a tough time trying to contain LaMarcus Aldridge on defense, and he also struggled to get his shot to drop, missing more than a few shots right under the basket. He’s been in a mini-slump in terms of efficiency over the past two games, connecting on just 37.5% of his shot (dunk) attempts, but he should be able to get things back on track on Tuesday vs. Washington.

             Gallo's minute-limit was lifted tonight but his hand was in ""constant pain"" after a fall in the first quarter -- that explains his 1-of-9 shooting line. There's obvious risk here given his injury history, so owners should check his status again on Monday before committing to him in weekly lineups.

             Head coach Nate McMillan was prescient, saying before the game, ""[Oladipo] creates a lot of offense for us, in transition, as well as the halfcourt. You can play him off the ball, with the ball ... Teams are playing him a little different. He’s seeing some double teams, which is opening up opportunities for other guys."" Oladipo has been carrying fantasy teams all season long and he's not about to stop with Indy battling for playoff position.

             Turner came in shooting a combined 26.1% over his previous six games, so it was great to see his shots falling tonight -- he also mixed up the offense with two 3-pointers and four buckets in the restricted area. He's been a letdown based on preseason expectations, but will be a sneaky post-hype target next draft day.

             Green did bang knees with Patty Mills during the second quarter and walked back to the locker room prior to halftime, but he got back out there during the second half didn’t seem any worse for the wear so he should be fine for Tuesday’s game against the Wizards. However, Chris Paul (hip) is also expected back on Tuesday, so Green’s minutes could dip back to the teens.

Chris Paul (hip) is expected to get back to the court on Tuesday, so Gordon figures to head back to the bench when the Rockets take on the Wizards. His knee looked fine, though, so that shouldn't be an issue moving forward.

             Harden had a tough time getting going against San Antonio’s vicious defense, not getting his first 3-pointer to drop until the closing seconds of the third quarter, and the Spurs also ran a lot of plays on offense to take advantage of Harden’s subpar defensive play. Still, he found a way to be effective by getting to the line (8-of-8), and he also did an excellent job of creating on the drive-and-kick. We’d expect a more efficient outing on Tuesday against the Wizards.

            Wilson Chandler (nasal fracture) will not play on Sunday.
        
        
             Chandler's absence means the Nuggets will likely give more minutes to guys like Trey Lyles and Torrey Craig, but it's not yet clear who will start in his place. Presumably, Chandler will be cleared to play after being fitted for a mask, but the Nuggets haven't offered any potential return dates.

The temporary start tonight may have been a gift from the coaching staff on his 30th birthday, and there's obviously no way to trust him for fantasy purposes.

             ""Sean, I've always liked him,"" said coach Fred Hoiberg. ""He's really good at getting the ball and driving it into the paint, a very good cutter ... A big part of what we are looking at and trying to accomplish these last weeks of the season is, ‘Are these guys long-term fits?'"" Kilpatrick fits the mold of a young player they want to air out over the final games, and he's worth a look if you need a cheap scorer -- he's hit double-digits in three of the past four games.

             Felicio didn't play at all in the first half but he took over for Robin Lopez to begin the third quarter -- it's standard operating procedure for the tanking Bulls, who still somehow won this game vs. Washington. In light of his inconsistent role and the fact that he hasn't blocked a shot since Mar. 19, owners can leave Felicio on the wire.

             The rookie hadn't scored 23+ points since Jan. 10, but he was cooking all game long during this matinee matchup, adding six rebounds with just one turnover in 25 minutes. He banked in a 3-pointer to earn a four-point play in the second quarter (see below), and is now the third 7-footer in NBA history to make 130+ triples in a season, joining Dirk Nowitzki and Brook Lopez. The sky is the limit in both fantasy and reality.

Either way, Satoransky should get enough run with the second unit to be worth holding.

             Nowitzki has been playing through some pain in his left ankle for about a week now, and his knee is also an issue, but he'll fight through the pain and get on the floor tonight. However, he's only going to play minutes in the mid-20s, and if the game turns into a blowout, he won't play much at all. He's not a very attractive target in most leagues.

He's been a steady mid-round guy all year long and should close out the season strong with Philly battling for seeding.

The 76ers have now won 10 straight, which is the first 10-game winning streak they've had since 2000. Trust the process.

             Covington got off to a rough start offensively, missing his first seven attempts, and overall he didn't have a great game in terms of efficiency, going 7-of-21 from the field. However, he ripped away three steals within the first five minutes of play, and while he wasn't able to match his career-high, the seven swipes set a new season-high for RoCo. The shooting won't always be pretty, but his ability to rack up the triples and steals at an elite rate is what drives his fantasy value.

He did appear to tweak his ankle late in the third, and while he initially played through it, he began the fourth quarter on the bench and with the game being a massive blowout he never got back to the court. The 76ers open up next week with a Tuesday-Wednesday back-to-back, and while the ankle tweak seemed minor, we'll throw him on the injury report just to be safe.

            Kemba Walker went 2-of-7 from the field and 5-of-5 from the stripe on his way to 10 points in Sunday's loss to the 76ers.
        
        
             Walker added one 3-pointer, one rebound, four assists, one block and four turnovers through 26 minutes of floor time, and he was unusually passive in this one, not getting his first shot to drop until there was one minute left in the second. We'd expect a bit of a bounce-back performance on Tuesday with a much more favorable matchup against Chicago.

             Batum has yet to crack double-figures in the scoring department since getting back from the Achilles issue, posting meager averages of 7.3 points, 4.8 assists and not much else on 38.5% shooting over the past four games. He has enough upside to warrant ownership in most leagues, but he's hitting a rough patch at the worst possible time in fantasy hoops.

             Lamb brought some nice energy off the bench, and as an added bonus for 9-cat owners, he didn't commit a single turnover while he was out there. Lamb's foot did not appear to be an issue at all in his return from a one-game stint on the sidelines, so he should be good to go on Tuesday in Chicago.

He did, however, record his 49th double-double of the season today, which tied him with Larry Johnson for the most single-season double-doubles in franchise history. He could set the single-season record on Tuesday in Chicago.

             Hernangomez did an excellent job of getting to the rack and finishing through contact, going 11-of-14 from the charity stripe, which set a new career-high in both makes and attempts from the line. With the Hornets officially eliminated from post-season play, Hernangomez should see more opportunity coming his way, but he really can't be viewed as anything more than a low-end option in deep leagues.

            JaMychal Green (knee soreness) has been ruled out for Sunday's game against the Trail Blazers.
        
        
             The Grizzlies were scheduled for four games this week, so they'll take it easy on Green for the final game and sit him out, although he should be back in action for Wednesday's game in New Orleans. Jarell Martin and Ivan Rabb will likely split most of Green's minutes, with Martin offering the most upside.

He should continue to improve as his minutes ramp up, and as a guy with top-30 upside, he's worth a look in most settings.

             To be clear, CP3 has already been ruled out for Sunday's game. D'Antoni said Paul will be held out until he's ""100, 100, 100 percent"" healthy, so the fact that he's probable for Tuesday suggests it's very minor. We should get a better sense of his status late on Monday.

John Henson (finger) also went through the morning shootaround and is considered questionable. If Maker is cleared, there's no guarantee that he takes his minutes back from Tyler Zeller because Nikola Jokic ate him alive in their last matchup.

             Henson participated in the morning shootaround, but coach Joe Prunty said he wasn't sure if he would be cleared by the medical team. We'd expect him to warm up which means he'll likely end up being a game-time call along with Thon Maker (groin). If Henson can't go, Tyler Zeller could be looking at another start and had two points, five rebounds, two assists, three blocks and one steal in 28 minutes against the Lakers on Friday.

             ""I would say we’re at the stage now where it almost becomes, ‘Why?’"" ask him to play, coach Steve Clifford said. ""It’s so hard to not play for long stretches off the season. Why, with five games left, would we even play him? It makes more sense to me to let him get back to 100 percent and then just start again next (season)."" Zeller battled soreness and swelling in his surgically-repaired knee, but he'll have the entire offseason to get his body right and should reprise his role as Dwight Howard's backup next season. Willy Hernangomez will soak up his minutes for the remainder of the season.

            Rondae Hollis-Jefferson (facial laceration) is questionable for Sunday's game vs. the Pistons.
        
        
             RHJ is coming off a monster 20-point game with 14 rebounds, two assists, two steals and a block in 39 minutes. There's no clear pickup if RHJ sits out, as the Nets will likely use a committee approach to soak up RHJ's minutes. He's been playing mostly as a small-ball four, so Dante Cunningham and Quincy Acy will be candidates to step up.

             He'll join Treveon Graham (concussion protocol) and Cody Zeller (knee) on the shelf. Jeremy Lamb (foot) is a game-time call, so we should see more of Michael Kidd-Gilchrist and Malik Monk if Lamb can't go. It's hard to rely on anyone in Charlotte not named Kemba Walker, Nicolas Batum and Dwight Howard, especially with 13 games on Sunday.

             This is a shame because Graham would've been in the mix for minutes with Dwyane Bacon (ankle) out and Jeremy Lamb (foot) considered a game-time call. Graham averaged just 15.8 minutes in his last four outings, so look for Michael Kidd-Gilchrist and maybe even Malik Monk to pick up a handful of minutes.

             Dwayne Bacon (ankle sprain) and Treveon Graham (concussion) are both out, so it's possible that we'll get an extended look at Malik Monk if Lamb can't go. Lamb was a late scratch for Saturday's game vs. the Wizards, and the Hornets will probably be watching him closely if he's cleared to play. His upside isn't too high when Nicolas Batum is active, so you might be able to find a better option on your wire on a 13-game slate.

Ilyasova has plenty of experience as a starter in Philly and made 51 starts in 2016-17 with averages of 14.4 points, 6.4 rebounds, 2.0 assists, 0.7 steals and 1.9 triples. He's a solid option even on a full slate.

This is another reason to like Richaun Holmes as a streaming option, but Ersan Ilyasova may be the biggest winner and will likely slide into the starting lineup.

             As expected, John Wall (knee) will be rested on the second game of a back-to-back set. Satoransky still played 26 minutes on Saturday off the bench and that includes some minutes next to Wall. He's a strong play on Sunday, but if he continues to see minutes in the 20s then he certainly has enough upside to hold decent value for the rest of the season.

Tyrone Wallace has stepped up for the Clippers, as he's averaging 12.0 points, 6.0 rebounds, 1.0 assists, 0.5 blocks, 2.0 steals and 0.5 triples over his last two games.

            Danilo Gallinari said he still has pain in his right hand.
        
        
             He returned to action on Saturday, but didn't hit his first shot until the second quarter and finished with 11 points, two rebounds, one assist, one steal and a blocked shot. ""Listen, he was OK,"" coach Doc Rivers said. ""He was better in the second half. I thought his rhythm may have upset other rhythms. You never know. We need him, and we’re going to use him."" The Clippers are in 9th place in the West and two losses behind the No. 8 seed (Pelicans), so expect Gallinari to play through the pain.

             Cooley was logging some time with Zach Randolph away from the team. The fan favorite's playing time was likely a one-off, as Z-Bo is set to re-join the team in Los Angeles on Sunday. Cooley's fantasy appeal is limited to the very, very deepest of leagues at this point.

             It will be a memorable game, but for all the wrong reasons. Carter inadvertently undercut Patrick McCaw under the basket in the second half and the Warriors player was taken off on a stretcher and later to the hospital for further tests. Carter received an earful from Golden State coach Steve Kerr, and he was visibly distraught after the ugly incident. Kevin Durant later consoled Vinsanity, and Kerr also had some kinder words for him later. Carter ended up with four points, five rebounds an an assist in 15 minutes off the bench.

             Sampson was in the rotation with Zach Randolph away from the team, but he flamed out with an 0-of-7 shooting night. He has missed his past 10 attempts over three games, and it's no surprise why he is nailed to Dave Joerger's bench most evenings. Nothing to see here from a fantasy perspective.

             Hield caught fire from down deep, hitting 4-of-5 from behind the 3-point line, and his hot hand ended up buying him more minutes. In fact, he had more minutes than everyone else in a Kings jersey except for Skal Labissiere, who also logged 29 minutes. Hield also chipped in with four assists, three rebounds, two steals and just one turnover. He is closing out the season well and producing at top-50 value in 9-cat leagues.

             Fox ended up hitting 6-of-11 from the field and he dished out eight assists with three rebounds, two blocked shots and a steal. He has struggled from behind the arc all season, but he has really been bad lately. Fox was 0-of-2 in his one from the perimeter, and he is just 2-of-21 across the past 11 outings. He is a player with plenty of upside, but he really needs to do work to improve on his 3-pointer accuracy, and his awful free-throw percentage can use some sprucing up, too.

             That's great news. He also had a chest X-ray which came back clear, and he is awaiting results of a CT Scan and he will also underdog an MRI. He was undercut inadvertently by veteran Vince Carter who was so distraught that Kevin Durant gave him a hug. Head coach Steve Kerr let him have an earful initially, but also talked with Carter after McCaw was stretchered off. It was an ugly incident, but it appears McCaw has escaped serious injury for now.

             Thompson was sidelined due to a fractured right thumb, but he did not show any issues by going 10-of-19 shooting, including 3-of-7 from behind the arc, to finish with 25 points. He also added two rebounds, an assist and a steal with four turnovers. The Warriors have a quick turnaround, hosting the Suns on Sunday. It should be a big game for the Golden State offense, and there is no reason to believe Thompson will be limited or held out due to the back-to-back situation.

He also snagged 10 rebounds with five assists and a blocked shot to lead the charge. It was his first full game back after his ribs issue. He returned on Thursday, but he was ejected right before halftime after picking up his 14th technical foul of the season. We'll see if he is back to 100 percent with the team right back at it on Sunday against the defensively challenged Suns.

His only other contribution was his two rebounds, as he didn't offer any other stats. Of course, he also didn't turn the ball over, either.

             Dragic hit 7-of-17 from the field, including 2-of-4 from behind the 3-point line, while also chipping in with eight rebounds and two assists. While he had a plus-11 rating, he did turn the ball over a team-high four times, too. The rebounds were his most since he snagged nine boards in a game in New Orleans on Feb. 23. He remains a fantasy player with mid-round value, and he'll continue to log heavy minutes as the Heat scratch and claw for a playoff spot in the Eastern Conference.

             Johnson finished with six points on 2-of-4 shooting while adding four rebounds with an assist and just one turnover. He tweaked his right ankle in the first half of Thursday's game against the Bulls, but he and head coach Erik Spoelstra downplayed the injury and were apparently telling the truth. He looks just fine for Tuesday's game against Atlanta and beyond.

             McCaw went in for a layup and Carter came underneath him, with McCaw landing on his backside or tailbone. He was down for several minutes in an ugly scene inside the paint and appeared to be in tremendous pain. He entered the game already dealing with lower back trouble, so this will not help. McCaw is a good source of steals when healthy, but it might be a miracle that he returns in the regular season after this scary incident. He was transported to UC Davis for further evaluation, according to the team. Hopefully the injury isn't as serious as it appeared to be on television tonight.

             Johnson hit 7-of-10 from the field and 4-of-5 from the free-throw line, adding six rebounds, five assists, two blocked shots and a steal. It was a nice bounce-back game from Johnson after he managed just two points across 30 minutes Thursday against Chicago. He looked like waiver wire material earlier in the month, but he is worth owning again across the board.

             Russell was benched early in the first half and he did not sniff the court the rest of the way, as head coach Kenny Atkinson rode Caris LeVert and Spencer Dinwiddie instead. ""I felt like those other guys came in and started to play great. You just go with it as a coach. It was just a feel,"" Atkinson said after the game. Russell sat dejected on the bench with a long face for the entire second quarter, second half and overtime. We'll see if it is a temporary situation or if Russell is chained to the doghouse on Sunday when the Pistons pay a visit to Brooklyn.

             Dinwiddie took advantage of the bench of D'Angelo Russell, who had an atrocious scoreless performance with two turnovers and an 0-of-5 shooting night. It was his first double-double since Feb. 27, and his most dimes since he doled out 13 in a game against San Antonio back on Jan. 17. If Russell is in Kenny Atkinson's doghouse, it might mean extra run for Dinwiddie for the rest of the regular season.

Rozier is starting to heat up and continues to show he needs more minutes even when Kyrie Irving is back. Keep him rolling for the rest of the season.

             Valanciunas was 6-of-12 from the field and 0-of-1 from behind the 3-point line while adding a blocked shot. It wasn't a huge fantasy line, but a double-double is never anything to sneeze at. After a lull in the stats for a few games, Valanciunas is back at it with 14.7 points, 9.3 rebounds and 2.0 blocked shots per game over the past three outings. He'll look to keep it cooking Tuesday in Cleveland in a showdown of Eastern Conference powers.

             His great toe sprain may have been an issue and he wasn't as aggressive on either end. Toe injuries can really linger and the Celtics aren't playing for anything, so there's a good chance Brown won't be playing in the back-to-back set coming up on Tuesday.

             C.J. Miles fouled Morris with 10 seconds left and the Celtics up 10, so Morris had some things to say. They were split up, but Morris kept talking moments led to eventually lead to the ejection. He was ejected between free throws, so Jabari Bird had to take the second one, so that's a fun fact. Before that, he was outstanding with 25 points, nine rebounds, three assists, two blocks and one 3-pointer. He's worth owning in most leagues right now, but beware of some rest on Tuesday or Wednesday.

             DeRozan was a solid 12-of-19 from the field, although he was a lackluster 0-of-5 from behind the 3-point line. He also contributed with seven assists, seven rebounds and a blocked shot, posting his second-highest point total since Feb. 23. While he is just 1-of-16 from behind the arc over the past five outings, he is contributing well sharing the ball.

             Ibaka was tremendously efficient from the field, going 5-of-7, including a perfect 3-of-3 from behind the arc. He also had an assist with just two turnovers and might have done more if not for five personal fouls keeping him on the pine for longer stretches in the second half. The outing marked just his second double-double in 20 games dating back to Feb. 14. He hasn't had back-to-back double-doubles all season. He'll look to remedy that situation on Tuesday in Cleveland.

             He need a Lasik endorsement for much he can produce a 20/20. Drummond didn't get it today, but he has 20 20/20s since 2012-13 for the most in the NBA in that span. Drummond's blocks are also surging these days and now he's averaged two-plus blocks per game in both February and March. His free throw percentage issues are worth the trouble in head-to-head category leagues, so taking him in the second round next year kind of makes a lot of sense.

             That's a big line for a guy who has been mostly a one-trick pony on the stat sheet. He'll be doing that trick a bunch with plenty of shots from deep and he gets the Nets poor perimeter defense on Sunday.

             This is an interesting one after Gasol wasn't out there for most of the key minutes late in Friday's loss to the Jazz. The Grizzlies had a bad week for their lottery chances with a couple wins including one against these Blazers, so maybe Gasol is held out. If so, Deyonta Davis and JaMychal Green would benefit most with Jarell Martin and Ivan Rabb behind them.

             He's looking much better and not having Blake Griffin around should give him more chances to produce offense. The 25 minutes is noteworthy here because the Pistons have been playing him 28, so maybe the Pistons will play him on Sunday against the Nets.

             What is going on here? Nobody thought Burke could sustain his output, but he's been going strong since the break. In his previous games since All-Star, Burke averaged 16.2 points, 2.2 boards, 5.0 dimes, 0.8 steals and 1.4 treys on a mind-boggling 51.2 FG% at 6'1"". He couldn't even produce consistently in summer league during his Jazz days, but Burke has somehow become of the best scorers you could've found off the waiver wire.

             After missing the last three games, O'Quinn logged a season-high 32 minutes, which is shockingly high after his next best was 32. Enes Kanter (back) not playing explains most of it and coach Jeff Hornacek likely wanted KOQ out there on Andre Drummond. The Knicks are off for a few days, so maybe Kanter could be back. Congrats if you used him, but he's not a strong pickup until we find out more on Kanter.

             Coach Jeff Hornacek is probably going to keep a tighter leash on Mudiay, and three turnovers were a problem as usual. With Trey Burke as hot as he is, Mudiay flopping today with so many guards out doesn't bode well for him.

             Sliding Tim Hardaway Jr. over to the two was huge for Williams. His 33 minutes were the most he's played as a Knick to crush his previous best of 26 back on Mar. 9. The Knicks will almost certainly get Frank Ntilikina for the next one, so Williams will likely be dropping back to the low 20s.

             This is the expected news on Ball after the Lakers decided to keep Alex Caruso with the big club and not send him to the G League. According to the Lakers broadcast last night, the Lakers will be conservative on Lonzo, and he won't be playing until he's not feeling any soreness. Josh Hart needs to be added everywhere while a Caruso double-double with dimes isn't an outlandish prediction, especially with Brandon Ingram out.

             The return of John Wall shouldn't affect Beal negatively too much. Interestingly, Beal has scored more points per minute next to Wall and his efficiency also goes up, but of course his dimes take a major dip from 5.4 without to 3.3 with Wall. Either way, Beal should be heavily leaned on as the Wizards try to avoid falling to the No. 8 seed.

             It's very important to note that Sato did get minutes next to John Wall in the first half. Satoransky was very aggressive in drives, and it's fair to think he can find himself getting minutes in the 21-27 range most days. He's efficient enough that he may still hold some value, but feel free to drop him if he's one of your bottom-five players. The combo guard does play on Sunday and Wall is out for that one, so most of his owners will want to see how that game pans out before making a roster call.

             One of the biggest questions last year was whether or not Porter's breakout last year was for real. Well, it is. With his most recent uptick, it'll be interesting to see what happens with Otto next to Wall because his usage rate drops from 20.7 without Wall while it's just 15.5 with him. He needs more shots and he's shaping up to be a top-30 pick in drafts next year.

Ingram looked a little out of it as he headed to the locker room last night, and now he'll likely be missing multiple games. Simply put, Josh Hart needs to be added in all leagues. Additionally, the other rotation players will have to pick up scoring, and this also really helps out Alex Caruso.

             When he's off, he's tough to off. Oubre could see additional time at forward on Sunday because Markieff Morris (illness) didn't play in the second half. However, the return of John Wall does cap his upside a bit, but he could have a big game against the Bulls on Sunday.

             Yuck. Walker did not score at all in the first half and he didn't even go to the line. That's good for his second-worst 17.7 usage rate this season, and tied for his lowest attempts from the field. Walker has made it clear he wants to play, so for now expect him to keep suiting up. Ignore this dud, of course.

             He's playing arguably his best ball since his Orlando days with his 21-12 point-board average this month.

             He picked up some wing minutes today because of Jeremy Lamb not playing in this game. The Hornets probably want to see Monk get it going here or else they'll have hear about Donovan Mitchell with no comeback of their own, so maybe he gets closer to 30 minutes -- Dwayne Bacon being out could also help him. Still, Monk is really just a dart throw stream or DFS play while Lamb is out.

             He's had some hamstring soreness before this season and did not play on Friday. This game should be a little tougher than a home game against the Grizzlies as they head up to the Target Center for a Rubio revenge game.

             He looked awesome in his return to the lineup, but the Wizards will play it safe against the red-hot Bulls on their one-game winning streak. On Saturday, Wall scored 15 points with three rebounds, 14 assists, one steal and two 3-pointers in 33 minutes. He played nine minutes in his first stint and bookended his first half with 3-pointers. Tomas Satoransky gets another start in a great matchup.

             He went through contact drills on Friday and is getting much closer. The Wolves are going to be off until Thursday after the Sunday game, so that sounds like the target for Butler. It'll be Nemanja Bjelica getting at least one more start, but then you may want to cut him after that.

             He should see a good amount of minutes at small forward tonight with the Celtics likely having to play bigger because of their lack of guards. Morris is a little risky to use and his ankle issue is more legit than some guys getting the night off because he rolled it on Monday.

             He was in uniform last night and had a splint over his ring and pinkie fingers on his right hand. This has been weird situation, but it sounds like Booker could be out beyond Sunday. It's Troy Daniels and Josh Jackson time, assuming there's no change here.

             Well, the Celtics are going to be missing a few guards today and Terry Rozier is going to get a scary amount of minutes. Kadeem Allen could be the next man up while Abdel Nader would also have to log minutes. Larkin was shaping up to being a nice stream or DFS play today, so this one is rough to anyone looking to count on him today to end a weekly matchup.

             He has a left great toe sprain and the Celtics sound they're comfortable playing him today. Brown is going to be needed in a big way because of so many guards out of the lineup. Fire him up in standard leagues, but he'll be risky in DFS because of a possible aggravation.

             There are only six minutes left in this game, so Bacon is probably out for the night. Coach Steve Clifford has talked him up lately and Bacon could see more minutes in April, but of course he would have to get over this ankle issue first.

             That's a brutal blow for the Blazers and their second unit. The good news is Zach Collins is coming off a career night and the Blazers may get this opportunity to see if he can provide meaningful minutes in the postseason. This also means Jusuf Nurkic should have a higher floor most nights, but the Blazers may not want to up his minutes too much given his injury history.

If there is good news, this isn't to his troublesome right ankle, but of course Hill has taken a long time to recover from injuries. Jordan Clarkson and Jose Calderon will pick up minutes with Clarkson being the better add in fantasy.

Emmanuel Mudiay could get 30 minutes today while Trey Burke gets a big opportunity again. We could see some Tim Hardaway Jr. play more SG to open up some forward minutes, too.

             To be clear, he still needs to be cleared by doctors and this sounds like the most optimistic target. Presumably, Embiid will be over his concussion symptoms by then, and he will likely have to wear a mask. While he's out, Amir Johnson may start, but Ersan Ilyasova and Richaun Holmes are the fantasy pickups.

Now after his time off due to a hip flexor strain, he's playing without it again. Whiteside won't be the type of player to log 30 minutes per night anymore, but he could still have himself plenty of productive games.

             This was fairly obvious news coming as the Bucks have struggled to add depth at PG. Although they won't need it too much if Eric Bledsoe plays half as well as he did last night. Jennings does have a few good games under his belt, but his value is tied to Bledsoe quite a bit.

            Klay Thompson (thumb) will return from a fractured right thumb Saturday at Sacramento, according to Chris Haynes of ESPN.com.
        
        
             As has been the case all week, Thompson will be returning from his hand injury. He's been going through on-court work for about two weeks and he sounded ready at practice on Friday, so we're expecting him to be hitting the ground running. This will take shots from Nick Young and Pat McCaw, but Quinn Cook still can be trusted despite a lower upside.

The Hawks have the space to sign him, and it's a little interesting that they opted for a big man with so many injuries to their guards. This is good news for Isaiah Taylor, who tweaked his ankle last night. Leave Evans on the wire.

             He is considered probable, but it would be a major shock to see Thompson not play. He's been talking about playing Saturday all week and went through a full practice on Friday. Thompson should get a ton of shots tonight with no Stephen Curry, so he could be in for a big night against a team he has lit up before -- he scored 37 points in one quarter against them in 2015.

However, he now has an ankle injury he'll have to fight through. We should have an update on his status Sunday morning after shootaround. Dwight Powell (knee) is also listed as questionable on Sunday, so the Mavs may be thin upfront vs. the Cavs.

He ended up starting 27 consecutive games while Wall recovered from knee surgery and averaged 10.4 points, 4.2 rebounds, 6.0 assists and 1.1 steals over those 27 starts. He'll get one more start on Sunday, as the Wiz don't want Wall playing on the back end of a back-to-back.

             This will be the sixth straight game Simmons has missed due to the wrist injury. And the fact that he has been ruled out 24 hours ahead of this game, is a sign that's he's not all that close to returning to action. He belongs on the waiver wire in all standard fantasy formats at this point. Mario Hezonja and Rodney Purvis will continue to soak up extra minutes.

             Paul was initially ruled out of Friday's game due to a ""sore left hip."" However, the Rockets later said they were giving CP3 a rest day. We don't yet have an official reason for Paul being sidelined on Sunday, only that he won't play. Eric Gordon (knee) will return to game action on Sunday and should see plenty of playing time and scoring opportunities.

             This late scratch is certainly surprising, as Lamb had been listed as probable on Friday's injury report. With Lamb unavailable, Dwayne Bacon, Malik Monk and Treveon Graham will likely divvy up extra minutes on the wing. This is a situation to avoid from a fantasy perspective.

The Wizards will rest Wall on Sunday, but Brooks did say that the team is ""open"" to Wall playing in back-to-backs going forward. Washington has three sets of back-to-backs over the final seven games of their season. Tomas Satoransky will get bumped back to the bench with Wall returning to the starting lineup.

             Zubac was a very effective 6-of-9 from the floor while adding five rebounds and a team-best plus-15 rating. His playing time will still be rather limited as long as Brook Lopez is running hot. He entered the game with just 2.6 points per game in his previous 14 outings, and he hadn't had a double-digit point total since Feb. 26. His fantasy value remains limited to the very deepest of leagues at this point.

             Lopez has hit the 20-point plateau in eight of his past 12 outings as he finishes up strong down the stretch. He has also swatted at least one shot in four straight, and 10 of his past 11 contests. Next up is a visit against the Kings. He posted 11 points with four blocked shots in the most recent battle with the Kings on Feb. 24. March is the only month where he is shooting better than 47.2 percent, hitting a 55.4 percent clip.

            Josh Hart (hand) was back in the lineup Friday against Milwaukee and he posted 13 points with 13 rebounds over 35 minutes.
        
        
             Hart's return came just in time, as Kentavious Caldwell-Pope was ejected early in the game while Brandon Ingram went down with a possible concussion and joined Lonzo Ball (knee) and Isaiah Thomas (hip) on the shelf. The team plans to be conservative with Ball as he deals with soreness, so that's in Hart's favor. If Ingram is unable to play on Sunday against Sacramento it could be a very fruitful game for Hart. He was already going to be a hot add before this big performance, but that is especially so now.

             Kuzma also chipped in with six assists and two steals while adding two 3-pointers. He is working on a streak of six consecutive games with at least two triples, and he has drained at least one trey in 22 straight outings dating back to Feb. 4. Next up is a battle against the Kings on Sunday. For whatever reason he has struggled against Sacramento this season, going for just 12.0 points and 3.7 rebounds in three meetings.

             Randle struggled a little with his shot, hitting just 5-of-13 from the field, but he was a solid 7-of-8 from the free-throw line. He also grabbed three assists with a steal and a blocked shot. Randle is working on a career-high streak with five double-doubles, averaging 20.8 points and 10.4 rebounds per game during the impressive stretch. Next up is a visit from the defensively-challenged Kings on Sunday. He is averaging 16.0 points and 11.7 rebounds in three meetings against Sacto this season.

             Bledsoe hit 15-of-24 from the field, including an impressive 7-of-12 from behind the 3-point line, just missing a career high in points by two. He dropped a career-high 41 points Feb. 1, 2017 as a member of the Suns against L.A.'s 'other' team. Bledsoe was on fire with 26 points coming after halftime. He'll look to carry over the momentum in Sunday's road game against the Nuggets.

He was forced to exit Thursday's game briefly after tweaking his knee on a drive to the hoop. However, he re-entered that game, and he didn't show any ill effects of the ailment in this one. He'll have a day to rest his knee before the team hits the hardwood again on Easter Sunday in the Mile High City.

He continues to be a handful for everyone, even when his shot isn't falling. The good news for his fantasy owners is that the Bucks are scratching and clawing for a playoff spot in the Eastern Conference and he won't likely be rested at any point down the stretch.

             Marjanovic was 3-of-6 from the field and 4-of-5 from the free-throw line, helping the Clippers chop down a huge second-half lead and make things interesting down the stretch. It was just his second game with 12 or more minutes over his past 12 appearances so don't get too excited. He has some per-minute upside, but his playing time is rather erratic and he doesn't warrant much fantasy consideration outside of the deepest leagues at the moment.

             Nurkic, a.k.a. 'The Beast', posted his 23rd double-double of the season for Rip City. He is working on a streak with two or more blocked shots in four straight outings, and he is averaging 3.3 blocked shots per game over his past seven. He'll look to keep the good times rolling Sunday against the visiting Grizzlies.

             Collins hit 7-of-10 from the field and he was 1-of-1 from the free-throw line while also adding four assists, two rebounds and a blocked shot while turning it over just once. He was seeing some added run with Ed Davis (ankle) doing down with an ankle injury. Collins is averaging 12.5 points per game over his past two outings, hitting 11-of-16 from the field. He'll look to stay hot against the tanking Grizzlies on Sunday.

The big winner was Zach Collins, however, as he pulled down a career-high 15 points. For now, consider Davis day to day. We'll update his MRI results when available.

Expect another big game from Ingles on Sunday, with or without Rubio.

             We've seen some flashes from Exum since he returned from his shoulder injury, but this was his first extended look because Ricky Rubio sat out with hamstring soreness. Exum buried three triples with three rebounds, three assists and one steal, and his ability to attack off the dribble is going to give the second unit in Utah a huge lift. His dynasty stock is rising and he'll also be worth a look on Sunday vs. the Wolves if Rubio can't go.

             All those concerns about Millsap not being able to play with Nikola Jokic probably went away. Millsap lived in the paint with almost all of his shots in that range or from deep, and he drew his fouls within 10 feet to help him get to 11 attempts, as well. Coach Mike Malone has talked about using Millsap more as a facilitator, but maybe he just asks him to score more. Either way, Millsap is going to be huge for his fantasy owners.

It’s about all those guys in that locker room,"" Malone said. ""They still believe, and I think how hard they fought tonight shows that."" As for Jokic, he's not bashful anymore with 24.3 points per game over his last six and he won't be resting.

He finished 5-of-7 from the field and hit both of his free throws, but he'll be tough to rely on unless Rubio misses Sunday's game vs. his former team. Rubio is currently day-to-day with soreness in his hamstring.

             Peak Gerald. He had no other stats beside four fouls, and he was ice cold to start the game to keep his minutes down. After the shot from Green, James Harden gave the crowd a four-finger sign to show love to how Green is missing part of one of his fingers. Eric Gordon could play on Sunday, but Green could still get 30 minutes if Chris Paul is out.

             Wow. This comes on the heels of his 21-point debut on Wednesday with five 3-pointers, two assists, one rebound, one steal and one block. He was just as good in his second go around, hitting 8-of-13 shots and 7-of-7 free throws with two assists, one rebound, two steals and one triple. The Grizzlies lack firepower and Brooks has always been an excellent scorer, so it's probably time to add him for Sunday's game vs. the Blazers.

He finished with four points on 2-of-3 shooting while snagging eight rebounds with two blocked shots in 12 minutes off the bench.

             The Grizzlies were tied when he left the game at 4:01 left in the third quarter, but he didn't see the floor after that with Memphis embracing the tank. ""We gave our young guys an opportunity to play,"" coach J.B. Bickerstaff said of the decision to sit Gasol. This was an embarrassment to the Memphis franchise and the NBA and it's clear that Adam Silver has some work to do. At least the Grizzlies are going green with an electric tank that doesn't run on Gasol-ine. OK we'll stop.

             The Rockets may dial his minutes back slightly because he's had a few knee issues this season. Even if several players are sitting, it could be risky to use Mbah a Moute.

             He was 3-of-6 from the field, hit both of his free throws and was a +6 in the loss. This was his third game of the season with 4+ blocks, so it wasn't a total fluke. He's been getting more run lately, but averaged just 6.5 points, 7.0 rebounds, 0.5 blocks, 1.5 steals and 0.5 triples in 29.5 minutes over his last two games.

             This was his fourth straight game with single-digit points and his ninth straight with single-digit rebounds. He's really cooled off over the last two weeks, but maybe his knee injury has something to do with it. He was considered probable for tonight's game, so the Mavs may try to give him a day or two off in the final two weeks. Standard-league owners can do better.

             This was supposed to be Noel's turn to rest with the Mavericks rotating him and Salah Mejri, but their plans changed with Mejri sitting out with a right knee bruise. Noel has been running circles around the veteran center, so maybe they stop resting Noel and let him showcase himself for his upcoming free agency. That may be wishful thinking based on the way the Mavs have handled him, though. If he stays in the rotation consistently, Noel will be a great source of FG%, rebounds, steals and blocks.

Caldwell-Pope finished with six points on 3-of-8 shooting, including 0-of-3 from behind the line, while posting three rebounds, three assists and a steal across 16 minutes before getting the gate.

             Deep breath here. Chriss has played somewhat well for three games in a row now, and he seems to be more focused on both ends. His help defense has actually been good and he's running down the floor for transition offense. Chriss has been the most annoying player in fantasy, but this makes it three productive games in a row with 29 minutes per game over his last five outings. In those, he averaged 13.2 points, 8.6 boards, 1.8 assists, 1.4 blocks, 1.4 steals and 0.6 treys. This is what many envisioned on Chriss, so maybe he keeps it going. All this said, the odds you're disappointed after adding him are much higher than his 58.9 FT%. If this blurb seems long to you and it sounds like we're cautioning you before you add him, it's because we are. He's risky. We good? OK, he's probably worth an add if you want an upside big.

             Grant was included in key situations down the stretch in regulation, as head coach Billy Donovan said Carmelo Anthony told him to leave Grant in down the stretch of regulation. Grant hit 5-of-9 from the field, including 2-of-3 from behind the 3-point line, and he was able to post four rebounds and two steals. The 24-year-old bounced back nicely after a scoreless effort in San Antonio on Thursday.

             Jeff Teague played just 20 minutes and didn't touch the floor in the fourth quarter, and it's possible it could be injury related -- there's no word of a Teague injury from the Wolves, but he was holding his right hip. Jones averaged 8.8 points, 5.0 assists, 2.8 rebounds, 2.8 steals and 0.7 triples in 10 fill-in starts this season, so he could have some low-end streaming appeal on Sunday if Teague can't go. Just keep in mind that Minnesota only plays twice next week.

             Westbrook continues to try and make plays that aren't there, but the Nuggets were keying on him late in the game. Head coach Billy Donovan called a timeout at the end of regulation calling for Westbrook to drive it, but the coach said the Nuggets walled that off. He felt like the 3-pointer Westbrook generated for himself was a good one, but it did not fall leading to overtime. Westbrook can be reckless at times, but he had just two turnovers across his 44 minutes in this one.

Teague was holding his right hip, and while there's nothing official in regards to an injury, coach Tom Thibodeau simply said he was ""nicked up."" If we do hear bad news, Tyus Jones would become a low-end PG in standard leagues and Jamal Crawford would benefit and is coming off a great game with 24 points.

             He was 8-of-13 from the field and needed this game in the worst way after shooting 29% in his previous 10 outings. His recent slump can probably be blamed on his hip injury, so the few days he had off this week probably helped quite a bit. He's easily a top 50-75 player when his shot is falling and we'll see if he can keep it going on Sunday vs. OKC.

That is also his 11th of the season make him only the second 76er with more than 10 in a season (Wilt Chamberlain had 31 and 22 in two seasons). The 76ers may not be as good on paper without Joel Embiid, but their schedule is a piece of cake except for a home game vs. Cleveland. Simmons and these young 76ers will be dangerous and they still have a good chance at the No. 3 seed.

Coach Brett Brown has used Ilyasova as a center before, so that could be in the cards going forward. It will be matchup-dependent and obviously this line probably won't happen again, but Ilyasova is a decent add to see if he can keep it rolling. Also, the Ilyasova Charge Card was used as he drew a charge against his old team.

The Pelicans have six games left and are still jostling for playoff seeding, so they don’t have the luxury of resting Rondo at the moment.

The Pelicans are fighting for playoff seeding, so it's going to take a lot to keep him off the court. He added eight rebounds, three assists, one steal and two blocks and should look more like himself on Sunday in a crucial matchup vs. the Thunder.

             He split a pair of free throws, but made all four of his 3-pointers with four rebounds, two assists and three turnovers in 30 minutes. George Hill left the game with an ankle injury and wasn't able to return, so Clarkson could be looking at a short-term boost in value beginning on Sunday vs. the Mavericks. After his 5-point dud vs. the Hornets on Wednesday, there's a good chance he might be on your waiver wire.

             His crazy +40.5 net rating over the last two took a hit with his -2 in plus-minus today. Fultz had some nice shooting touch in this game and he's slowly rounding into form. He is Ben Simmons' backup, so he's not the strongest add until he gets more minutes next to him.

James continues to exceed expectations in his age-33 season and it’s going to be awesome to see him switch into another gear for the postseason.

             Smith was coming off a nice 19-point effort, but was averaging a mere 8.3 points, 2.9 rebounds, 1.6 assists, 0.8 steals and 1.4 triples on 43.9% shooting in March prior to Friday. That’s not getting the job done for standard-league owners, especially in the fantasy playoffs. Smith should also lose some value when Kyle Korver (personal) rejoins the team and there are less shots to go around with Kevin Love back.

             This line could've looked a lot better but he missed all six of his 3-point attempts. Love cleared the concussion protocol right before tip-off and was also sporting some braces for his loose tooth, but he did leave the game favoring his right hamstring. He was able to return, but this is at least worth monitoring in advance of Sunday's game vs. Dallas. For now, expect him to play.

             This pretty much sums him up with Amir not even taking a shot. He's not going to be asked to score, he'll defend centers, and he'll be out there grabbing boards. Leave Johnson on the wire unless you're hunting boards or maybe blocks.

             The bad news is he did tweak his ankle today and went to the locker room, but he did return and looked OK. Also, Dennis Schroder is now out for the season and Taylor was the only active point guard for the Hawks in this game. He'll probably struggle at times, but Taylor should be owned in standard leagues.

If he's out, the Nuggets will use a committee approach to soak up his minutes with guys like Trey Lyles and Torrey Craig getting a bump, but there is no clear pickup.

             Nance was a hot waiver-wire pickup after the All-Star break, but he’s been eerily quiet since returning from his hamstring tweak. In his previous four games he was averaging just 6.3 points, 7.5 rebounds, 1.3 steals and 0.5 blocks in 19.3 minutes, and Kevin Love, Jeff Green and Tristan Thompson all got more minutes tonight.

Robin Lopez probably won't be sitting in every game, so it'll be tough to keep Felicio on your roster through the minutes fluctuation.

             It was obvious he was going to sit when he was announced as a non-starter. Lopez will likely play again soon, but has minimal fantasy value.

             He's more than a shooter as Markkanen continues to roll to the basket well, and he leads the team in dunks. He did not play on Thursday due to a back-to-back set, so maybe he sit out one more game on Apr. 6 or Apr. 7. Markkanen likely will make an All-Rookie Team for his strong start to his career.

Hill will be  re-evaluated on Saturday morning, and he should be considered questionable for Sunday's game vs. Dallas.  Jordan Clarkson is the biggest winner here, while veteran Jose Calderon will also have to step up.

             It's a late scratch for Henson. Coach Joe Prunty said the plan was to start Henson about 60 minutes ago, so maybe that ""plan"" part of his quote was a small hint he was dinged up. Zeller may see a decent amount of minutes tonight.

             The Bulls went silly late to try to ""win"" this ""game"" with a closing lineup of Vonlah, Ryan Arcidiacono, Sean Kilpatrick, Cris Felicio and Jerian Grant. As for Vonleh, this is a fair expectation when Robin Lopez doesn't play.

             It's almost comical how Isaac's stat lines look so similar all the time. He brings the D stats, but he is struggling on offense.

             He did come off the bench in this game and that will likely continue because of Jonathan Isaac being back.

Royce O'Neale will draw the start which will push Donovan Mitchell to PG, and this means the Jazz will be able to get a long look at Dante Exum.

             He's back after three games on the shelf. The Grizzlies are healthy up front this evening, so Rabb will likely get a handful of minutes at best.

             He also has a bone bruise on his ankle. It's a little surprising that Schroder was originally able to return from this issue last weekend, but the Hawks waited until today to check on the severity. His season ends with career highs in points and steals over 67 games. The Hawks will looking at the lottery and Isaiah Taylor will be at the point. He needs to be owned in all leagues.

If you need threes and scoring to stream, you'd have a tough time finding a better option than The Four-Fingered Assassin. He's a great DFS play, too.

             LMAM is returning from a three-game absence, so the Rockets may watch his minutes closely tonight. They are a bit shorthanded with Chris Paul and Eric Gordon resting, but Gerald Green is probably the safest pickup for his upside in triples and points.

             The Rockets are starting to rest their key players with the No. 1 seed locked up, so Ariza may be due for a DNP soon. As for tonight, he's a strong play with Chris Paul (hip, rest) and Eric Gordon (knee) sitting this one out.

             He has some left knee soreness, so holding him out makes a lot of sense based on his injury history. With him and Chris Paul (hip) out, Gerald Green gets a bright green light to fire away some triples against a former team.

             He keeps getting called probable and this is a signature move for the Hawks much like a signature Dominique Wilkins tomahawk dunk. Collins should get around 25-30 minutes tonight, especially with no Joel Embiid.

             He was initially listed on the injury report because of a ""sore left hip,"" but now the Rockets are simply saying that he's getting a rest day. He'll probably have more of those on the way with the No. 1 seed locked up. Eric Gordon (knee, questionable) will benefit quite a bit if he's able to play, while Gerald Green is a nice streaming option for his points and triples against his former team.

With him out, Isaiah Taylor has looked the part of a score-first PG with 23.0 points per game over his last two while getting to the line a good amount.

Vogel also said that Isaac is on a 20-minute limit, so expect them to stick that in his return. He should be fun and could rack up defensive stats, but it may take a couple games to get rolling.

Maybe he rests Sunday for a back-to-back set, but obviously add Klay right now.

Iguodala has dealt with left knee issues for at least January and earlier in March this year, so expect him to miss more than Saturday. Pat McCaw and Nick Young could see a few extra minutes along with some of the power forwards.

             It's been a rough season for The Rooster with only 19 games played so far. He's been doing some running since at least Mar. 9, so maybe he won't be too limited. There's obvious risk in him going forward, but it's not a bad idea to add him for tonight to see if he can get hot. This does hurt guys like Tyrone Wallace, Wes Johnson and Montrezl Harrell.

He can play some point, he also plays on the wing, and he is probably going to be asked to score more than he has all season. Hart is one of the hottest adds this weekend and should be owned in standard leagues.

             Porter injured his right ankle in Thursday's loss to the Pistons. The X-rays came back negative, and after the game coach Scott Brooks said that Porter was only dealing with a ""mild"" ankle sprain. The Wiz play a back-to-back set on Saturday and Sunday, so Brooks may not want Porter to play on consecutive days, even if he is close to 100 percent. Washington plays at 3:00 pm EST on Saturday, so we should have an update by the early afternoon. Kelly Oubre would likely draw the start if Porter is ruled out

             Payton did not play Wednesday vs. the Clippers due to the tendinitis issue in his knee. Tyler Ulis drew the start on Wednesday and finished with 23 points, three rebounds and two assists in 37 minutes. Ulis would start at PG again on Friday, and log heavy minutes, if Payton is ruled out.

""He will take some contact [Friday], and then we’ll see how he feels.’’ According to the Star-tribune report, if Friday's workout goes well, ""it should give everyone more confidence in Butler’s ability to return before the regular season ends.

            Amir Johnson (illness) will start at center in place of Joel Embiid (face) Friday night vs. the Hawks.
        
        
             WIth Embiid sidelined 2-4 weeks, Johnson was expected to be named the starter. Johnson has started ten games previously this season and is averaging 7.1 points, 4.4 rebounds and 2.7 assists in 19.5 minutes over those ten contests. Despite coming off the bench behind Johnson, Richaun Holmes is the more attractive fantasy add. Holmes had 15 points and seven assists in 22 minutes on Wednesday.

            Blake Griffin has been diagnosed with a bone bruise in his right ankle and will be re-evaluated in a week.
        
        
             Griffin was a late scratch for Thursday's game against the Wizards. He was ruled out after pre-game warmups and underwent an MRI. This is a tough break for Griffin owners. The earliest Griffin would be able to return is Friday, April 6th. The Pistons play just four times from that date until the end of the season. With Detroit out of playoff contention, they have no motivation to rush him back into action. Thus, there is a realistic possibility they shut Griffin down for good next week. Anthony Tolliver is the primary beneficiary. Tolliver is averaging 18.0 points, 3.7 rebounds and 3.7 treys over Detroit's last three games.

             Kanter injured himself in Wednesday's loss to the Sixers when he landed on his lower back after a dunk attempt in the first half. He was able to stay in the game, but was wincing in pain at times. If Kanter is unable to play on Saturday, and Kyle O'Quinn (hip) remains sidelined, Luke Kornet would be the biggest beneficiary. Michael Beasley and Isaiah Hicks would also likely see an uptick in minutes.

He also did a solid job of limiting Eric Bledsoe’s opportunities on the other end of the floor, and with Klay Thompson (thumb) not expected back until Sunday, Cook should have at least one more game of being one of the main factors in Oakland’s offense. Yes, he’s must-own.

He did appear to tweak his left ankle early in the fourth, but after getting checked up on the bench he got back into the game despite the score being massively uneven, so he should be fine for Saturday’s game in Sacramento.

             Draymond didn’t really look to score in this one, not attempting his first shot until the second quarter, and with the game turning into a massive blowout after Kevin Durant’s ejection, Green took an early seat on the bench and never got back out there. In terms of his health, Green didn’t seem too affected by the ""flu-like symptoms"" that kept him out the past three games, so we'd expect him to play on Saturday.

             Looney’s immense hustle has earned him a steady mid-20 role in the rotation as of late, and over the past few weeks he’s been flirting with top-30 value in 9-cat leagues behind averages of 8.0 points, 5.3 boards, 1.3 assists, 1.6 steals, 2.4 swats and just 0.6 turnovers per contest on 57.1% shooting. He played so well on Thursday that Jordan Bell was nearly bumped from the rotation entirely, and right now, he’s the big in Oakland you want to own.

             Bledsoe added one 3-pointer, three rebounds, six assists, three steals, one block and two turnovers through 31 minutes as a starter, and he helped Milwaukee go on a big run during the third that completely blew the game open. With the win, the Bucks earned a five-game advantage over the No. 9 seeded Pistons, and now sit just 0.5 games behind the Heat for the No. 7 spot out East.

             Middleton did briefly exit the game during the second quarter after tweaking his knee on a drive to the hoop, but after a quick checkup in the locker room, he got right back out there and didn’t seem any worse for the wear. The Bucks do have a quick turnaround, though, with another game on Friday in Los Angeles, so owners will probably want to confirm his status prior to tip-off just to be safe as this is the sort of thing that could swell up overnight.

             Antetokounmpo did a really nice job of disrupting Golden State's passing lanes, destroyed them on the break, and also added a bonus two triples while hitting both his free throws. As for the ankle that has been an issue for Antetokounmpo as of late, he did acknowledge that he’s still feeling some discomfort there but said he feels good enough to keep on playing through it. With Milwaukee clinging to the No. 8 seed out East, they don’t really have the luxury of giving The Greek Freak any time off.

             Surname revenge game narrative? Bojan isn't Bogdan's bro, but the Kings rookie was coming in cold with only 22 points combined in his last three. He's gone through numerous slumps this season, but Bogdanovic has been noticeably better with efficiency at home this year. He should be around 30 minutes most nights and is worth owning in standard leagues.

             Iguodala appeared to tweak his knee on a drive to the hoop, and with this game turning into a major blowout, there's just no need for Iguodala to get back out there. He'll end his evening with five boards, four dimes, two steals, one block and two turnovers across 21 scoreless minutes. Steve Kerr said after the game that Iguodala ""probably won't play"" on Saturday in Sacramento, but maybe he'll be able to get back out there for Sunday's game against the Suns.

KD felt he got fouled on a drive to the hoop and aggressively walked up to an official, which resulted in him quickly getting tossed and he picked up his 14th technical of the season. At least his ribs didn't seem like a problem, and perhaps with him playing limited minutes tonight, he'll be allowed to play in both games of the Dubs' upcoming Saturday-Sunday back-to-back set.

             Westbrook was all over the place on defense, racking up three steals and a block to go with 11 rebounds and five assists, but he was sloppy with the rock (seven turnovers) and took some very questionable shots down the stretch. The loss evened up the SA-OKC regular-season series at two apiece, and while the Spurs and Thunder now own the same record out West, the Spurs own the tie-breaker for the No. 4 seed.

He might not be the most consistent guy out there, but his minutes aren’t going anywhere and his ability to rack up the steals and triples and an elite rate is what makes him so enticing in fantasy hoops.

             George had the hot hand early for OKC, and he did a really nice job of collapsing San Antonio’s defense and finding the open man on the kick out. PG-13 was coming into this game shooting just 22.6% from the field over the previous two, so while tonight’s shooting performance wasn’t anything remarkable, it was a step in the right direction and he also buried all five of his freebies.

             Adams got off to a slow start, but really picked up his play after halftime, and as per usual, he was excellent on the offensive glass. He did play some solid defense against LaMarcus Aldridge but just didn’t happen to come away with any defensive statistics, which, unfortunately, was his second game in a row without a steal. We’d expect a more productive outing in the defensive department on Friday against the Nuggets.

             Green was replaced by Pau Gasol in the starting five in what was likely a matchup-based moved against OKC, although his minutes weren’t really affected all that much and he still came through with the triples and swats without recording a single turnover. He’s an okay low-end guy to own in deep leagues, but Green is far too inconsistent to depend on in 12-team leagues with just 13 roster spots.

             Gay brought some nice energy off the bench with the second unit, and his solid defense helped him earn some extra minutes in the rotation. That said, he’s been really inconsistent this season and ranks outside of the top-150 on the year as a whole, so there’s not much incentive to own him in most places. Kyle Anderson finished with 10 points, one triple, two dimes and two steals in 23 minutes.

             Aldridge got off to a hot start in this one, piling up 19 points on 8-of-11 shooting by halftime, and while he slowed down after halftime, he came through with some clutch buckets for San Antonio down the stretch. LMA didn’t appear to be all that bothered by his knee, and we’d expect him to continue to push through the pain as long as the Spurs’ post-season relevant.

In that interview, J-Rich was asked why he got into a rhythm today. ""Shooting,"" he said with a smile. Richardson has brought a lot of smiles to his fantasy owners this year as one of the best picks in standard leagues. He's been a top-16 player since Dec. 1.

             He walked out of the arena, as well. The previous ankle injury kept him out six games, but again this wasn't as bad and TJ tried to play through the one today. The coach previously called Johnson ""a psycho"" for wanting to play through that injury, so it sounds like Johnson won't miss much time. Maybe they do hold him out on Saturday because it would give him almost a full week off before a Tuesday game. Basically every other wing benefits along with Rodney McGruder likely to be in the rotation.

"Hassan Whiteside

            After missing almost three weeks, Hassan Whiteside scored eight points with seven rebounds, four assists, one steal and two blocks in 19 minutes against the Bulls on Thursday.
        
        
             Just like it was before he was hurt, Whiteside did not play in the fourth quarter. He did have a really nice stint in the third quarter over eight minutes, and overall this was a win for Whiteside fans. He should be set for a Saturday game against the Nets, but maybe he gets a day off in a Tuesday-Wednesday back-to-back set, especially because the Heat will have clinched a playoff spot by then.

            Kelly Olynyk scored 11 points with three rebounds, one steal and two 3-pointers in just 17 minutes against the Bulls on Thursday.
        
        
             The minutes are discouraging for KO here, but foul trouble was an issue. Olynyk still closed this game out for the Heat and that trend should continue most nights. Sure, he's not going to be that top-25 player he was for the time Hassan Whiteside was out, but Olynyk still needs to be owned everywhere.

            Rodney McGruder started the third quarter on Thursday, finishing with five points and three rebounds in 12 minutes.
        
        
             He's basically the understudy for this team and gets the call when a key guard is out. That's what happened with Tyler Johnson today, and it doesn't sound like he'll be out long. McGruder would likely need three-plus guards to miss time to have value in even deep leagues.

            Bam Adebayo scored three points in 12 minutes against the Bulls on Thursday.
        
        
             He's probably going to lose more minutes as Hassan Whiteside gets back into shape. Adebayo was also on the bench to close with Kelly Olynyk getting the run. If you've been using the rookie, he's a drop.

             He did turn his left ankle in the second half as he stepped on Denzel Valentine's foot, but he stayed in the game. Wade did look flat after that play and it's always possible he will be sitting out. The Heat get the Nets on Saturday and their magic number is one.

             He did close this game out with both Tyler Johnson and Dwyane Wade dealing with ankle issues. Winslow would be a sneaky beneficiary if either of those two miss time because Josh Richardson would just slide over to shooting guard. If he was dropped and the Heat are missing wings, he would be a nice pickup in most leagues.

             He was busy tonight with Lauri Markkanen (back) out of this game and the Bulls missing numerous scorers. Portis has been hanging in the upper 20s when Markkanen is in the lineup, but fantasy owners should trust Portis regardless. He'll get a terrific matchup against the Magic on Friday. The Bulls have lost seven straight, so that game against the Magic could be big time for the tank.

             Productive game aside, Vonleh is likely going to be moving back to the bench because Lauri Markkanen should return. Although, maybe he could start at center with a possible suspension coming for Robin Lopez and Cris Felicio hurting. If two of the three guys above are out, Vonleh could be an option in DFS or streaming.

             That's the most minutes he's played since the Bulls changed their rotation after the break. The Bulls were more shorthanded than usual tonight, so expect Nwaba to move back to around 27-30 minutes on Friday. He's an OK player to hold while Zach LaVine is out.

             It was another monster game and Drummond was happy about it all game. Sure, the Pistons are out of the playoffs but that didn't stop him from dancing on the bench for the camera in the second half and after the game in an interview (video in link below). The bigger story from a fantasy perspective is that Blake Griffin (ankle) is hurting, so Drummond could be in for lines even bigger than this one.

             Only six shots in 32 minutes is a mild surprise for Tolliver. Blake Griffin (ankle) could miss time because he needed an MRI, but there isn't enough upside to add Tolliver unless you're in a deep league. A back-to-back on Saturday and Sunday is interesting, if you're fighting for treys in a daily league.

             Good news here, X-rays were negative and it confirms what it looked like in the third quarter. Porter is likely going to be a game-time call on Saturday, but maybe he is held out in a back-to-back set. It's not a bad idea to roll with some Kelly Oubre this weekend even if Otto is OK.

            Blake Griffin underwent an MRI on his right ankle on Thursday.
        
        
             Griffin tried to play but wasn't able to give it a go after struggling through his pre-game routine, but we won't speculate on the extent of this until we get those MRI results on Friday. Anthony Tolliver got the start in his place on Thursday and finished with 14 points, two boards, two assists, one steal, one block, one triple and one turnover in 32 minutes. He's on the radar in deep leagues with two more games this week.

             He did not go quietly and he'll absolutely be getting a fine for not leaving in a timely manner. Lopez also looked to have some profanity as he went into the tunnel, so that could get him suspended (video in link below). It doesn't really matter because he'll get games off anyway.

             He banged his right knee with Henry Ellenson in the third quarter, but Beal did return with six minutes left in the fourth. For now, he should be OK and the Wizards will need him as they get John Wall back into game shape. Beal owners may just want to check back that it's all clear, but for now having him dialed up for a back-to-back starting on Saturday.

             X-rays were negative on Otto Porter (ankle) tonight, so it sounds like he's day-to-day for now. With a back-to-back coming up this weekend, it makes a lot of sense to add Oubre in just about all leagues that are streaming with a moves limit regardless of Otto. KO is also playing better lately, too.

             This has pretty much been the Sato special with strong efficiency, light usage and other stats to go with it. It'll be interesting to see if he can slide over to play some SG again, but the Wizards are probably going to give him 20-24 minutes at PG even with John Wall back on Saturday. With a back-to-back coming up, Sato's owners in daily leagues may want to just roll him out there for those two before making a move.

He's been so boring this month with averages of 7.9 points, 6.3 boards, 1.8 dimes and 1.0 blocks. He's probably more of a streaming option when the Wizards are somewhat healthy.

He's been going through some practice for almost two weeks now, and this thumb issue may not affect his conditioning.

            Joel Embiid (face) could miss 2-4 weeks for his orbital fracture, according to ESPN's Zach Lowe.
        
        
             This is a fairly standard prognosis for an orbital fracture, but it can vary. Embiid will almost certainly be willing to wear a mask, which could help him get back out there. He's out for at least two games, but it's sounding like he's out for the season. Embiid also has a concussion and he'll have to get over that issue too. Add Richaun Holmes right now.

            Tyler Johnson (right ankle) will not return against the Bulls on Thursday.
        
        
             He suffered the injury in the first half and was able to play through it for a few minutes, but the discomfort was likely too much. Johnson missing time should open up a few minutes for Wayne Ellington, Dwyane Wade, Justise Winslow and now maybe Rodney McGruder gets back in the mix again.

            Otto Porter (right ankle) is doubtful to return on Thursday.
        
        
             This is probably good news for Otto after his leg looked to be twisted from the bad plant of his foot.  His ankle didn't turn over all the way and his leg getting a shockwave from the sprain was more concerning. If he is out for tonight, maybe he can make it back for Saturday. Although, the Wizards may be careful in a back-to-back set. Kelly Oubre is a solid speculative add.

             He landed on Robin Lopez's foot and was able to play through it for a bit. Johnson was grabbing his ankle, and it was a clear roll as it happened. Maybe he's just getting re-taped, so we'll see what happens to start the third. He went back with around two minutes left in the second quarter.

            Otto Porter (right leg) is headed to the locker room.
        
        
             It did not look good and he did not put weight on his right leg. Porter was defending the post under the basket, and his right knee just buckled before he went to the ground.  He was also in a lot of pain as the training staff looked at him. This would be a brutal blow to the Wizards with John Wall set to return Saturday. If Otto is out, Kelly Oubre would be a must-add pickup.

The other listed starters are Dejounte Murray, Patty Mills, Kyle Anderson and Pau Gasol, so barring a last-minute change, Danny Green will come off the bench.

             That's not good and he is going to be out indefinitely. He will have surgery in the coming days and the team could provide an update after the operation. We've seen a handful of players return quickly from this issue, and now we may see a Masked Process in the postseason. If your league runs past Sunday, you may want to see what the story is on Embiid before dropping him -- he is out for at least two games for sure. Richaun Holmes should be picked up in basically all leagues now.

             After a knee scare on Tuesday and an MRI, Aldridge won't miss a game due to a contusion. There's no talk of him being limited and he should be in the starting lineup. The Spurs need this one, so expect them to feed their best offensive player.

             There's no word on the severity, but this is not good news with the Pistons on the bring of being eliminated from the postseason. Until we get more information on this new injury, consider him questionable for Saturday against the Knicks. Expect to see a lot of Anthony Tolliver and some small-ball lineups. We should see some Henry Ellenson, too.

             He was put on the injury report for a migraine and he's had a history of them, so hopefully it won't affect him. Wade has six blocks in his last two games with two of those on LeBron James, and he's scored 25 points combined in his last two. He'll be a dicey option to use in fantasy tonight, especially with some possible garbage time coming.

             This is good news for the Lakers and Ball. While this is to the same knee that kept him out earlier this season, it sounds like he only has a bruise and didn't damage his MCL. The Lakers are probably going to be careful with their prized rookie, which means we could see some Alex Caruso and Tyler Ennis. Don't be surprise to see Josh Hart get big minutes, assuming he's a go.

Ariza hasn't had a ""rest"" day yet since he got over his hamstring issue during the break, so it makes sense to hold him out. If so, that means more run for P.J. Tucker, Gerald Green, Joe Johnson and others.

The Rockets have talked about resting players down the stretch, so it certainly makes sense to hold CP3 out against the last-ranked Suns. If Paul is out, that means Eric Gordon should be busy again.

This is also a home game for the Hawks, so not playing in the ATL speaks volumes. At this point, it feels like Isaiah Taylor should be owned in standard leagues.

His status will be determined tomorrow, but we'd consider him doubtful based on the week of inactivity. Josh Jackson and Troy Daniels could get starts again while Davon Reed has stepped up.

            Elfrid Payton (knee) T.J. Warren (knee) and Alex Len (ankle) did not practice on Thursday.
        
        
             Payton did not play on Wednesday due to lingering tendinitis, and he is listed as questionable for Friday. Both Shaq Harrison and Tyler Ulis played well without Payton, and as of right now we'd think Payton is out. Ulis is a solid add regardless of Payton while Harrison could be a sneaky DFS or stream play.

             We don't know exactly what he did, but a player going through a light practice with a hand injury doesn't mean too much -- Klay Thompson has been doing some light practicing. We'll get an update on Booker tomorrow, but for now consider him questionable.

             He said he was going to be available since Tuesday, so no surprise here. Durant has been going through practice for about a week now, and the highlight of his week was calling out ""Blog Boys"" for being obsessed with stats. Well, one of the NBA's most efficient players ever based on stats will get to make his unique case tonight. Fire him up everywhere and consider him a strong start in DFS.

             He spoke to the media today and mentioned he may have a tough time getting his wind back after his illness. Green also showed how his right elbow has swelled up on him, but he said there's no pain and he won't need it drained. He could be limited today and there's risk in DFS, but fire him up in season-long leagues. Expect Kevon Looney to move to the bench while the other bigs lose upside.

             He won't be playing against the Hawks or Hornets this weekend, but maybe he can return against the Nets on Tuesday. Embiid is at home after his hospital visit, and hopefully they're just holding him out as a precaution. The 76ers likely want the No. 3 seed badly, so they may not rest Embiid for long and maybe he wears a mask upon his return. Fantasy wise, adding Richaun Holmes this weekend makes a lot of sense while the other starters should see a bump.

With him out, the Pacers may pull out more two-center lineups with Domantas Sabonis and Myles Turner, or they could choose to go small with more Lance Stephenson.

             This report adds ""barring any changes"" Wall is out, but it's credible enough that we'd consider Wall doubtful despite his questionable tag. He has a great chance to play on Saturday against the Hornets, though. Tomas Satoransky will get at least one more shot as the starter today, and he should still see solid minutes as Wall gets back into form.

             This is a tough blow in a huge game against OKC. There was some hope that he could return for this game as the Nuggets end their seven-game road trip, and now they'll have to try to end a two-game losing streak without Harris. The Nuggets have been pretty shady on this topic, which typically means a player will miss more than a team is letting on -- see: Leonard, Kawhi. With Harris out, the starting five will have to really step up while Devin Harris and Trey Lyles see some extra time.

Coach Brett Brown is using Fultz as a straight backup PG to Ben Simmons right now, and that may not change. Defense has been the key for Fultz with a terrific 77.0 defensive rating in those last two, and he's QB'd his offense to a 117.5 offensive rating for a +40.5 net rating. Sure, he has shooting woes, but his defense and his 15:1 assist:turnover ratio has made this a terrific start to his return.

Noah Vonleh and Bobby Portis are both looking at heavy workloads tonight, but Markkanen should be back on Friday and we don't know how long Felicio will be sidelined.

             He sure seemed healthy on Tuesday with 22 points, four rebounds, two assists and a block, but it's obvious  what the Bulls are trying to do here -- the Bulls currently have the eighth best draft lottery adds and teams from No. 2 to No. 9 are all separated by five games. This is the front end of a back-to-back, so Markkanen will likely be back on Friday vs. Orlando. Look for Bobby Portis and Noah Vonleh to pick up the slack tonight.

             He played through his right ankle tweak on Tuesday and has been able to rest for a couple days. He's been the best player in fantasy by a mile and should have his way against Cleveland's 28th ranked defense.

             Coach Alvin Gentry didn't have a real update and said his status was unclear. Rondo will test his hand in warmups and that's when a final decision will be made. Ian Clark started in his absence on Tuesday, but was very disappointing with eight points and two assists in 29 minutes. Expect another monster game from Jrue Holiday if Rondo sits after his triple-double on Tuesday.

             The Magic previously listed him as doubtful, so this is a nice surprise. Isaac practiced Thursday and participated in full-contact work, so barring any setbacks, he should be back in the lineup vs. Chicago. Expect the Magic to experiment with a lot of Isaac-Aaron Gordon lineups going forward, so give him a look if you need help in blocks and steals.

There's no word of any setbacks, so expect him to be available once again on Friday. He deserves a lot of credit for not sitting out games unlike half the NBA.

             He spent the majority of his time with the strength and conditioning staff at the morning shootaround, so he likely won't test his knee until warmups. An MRI showed no structural damage, so the good news is that he's day-to-day with a contusion. If LMA can't play, a number of players will have to step up including Pau Gasol, Davis Bertans, Rudy Gay and Joffrey Lauvergne.

In two previous games vs. the Suns, Harden put up 37.5 points per game. Gerald Green loses most of his streaming appeal with Harden back.

             This means James Harden and Clint Capela will be back after resting on Tuesday. LMAM is having some trouble shaking this knee issue and the Rockets will probably play it safe with the No. 1 seed locked up. Gerald Green, Joe Johnson and P.J. Tucker are all candidates to pick up a few minutes if LMAM sits, but none of them are great fantasy options with the Rockets nearly at full strength.

             Whiteside also practiced in full on Wednesday, so we'd expect to see him play barring a setback in warmups. If he is cleared to play, that could push Bam Adebayo out of the rotation because Kelly Olynyk and James Johnson have been awesome in recent weeks. If Whiteside was dropped, make sure to pick him back up because he's a must-start player even with restrictions.

            Coach Stan Van Gundy believes that the Pistons have a chance to be really good if Reggie Jackson can stay healthy.
        
        
             ""He was healthy his first full year here and we won 44 games and we didn’t have nearly the talent around him then that we do now,"" SVG said. ""And then last year he had to come back in the middle of the season [due to tendinitis in his knee] and then this year he started off and we were 19-14. We know, it’s been demonstrated."" Jackson scored 20 points with five rebounds, three assists and two triples in 28 minutes vs.  the Lakers on Monday and could eclipse the 30-minute mark for the first time since his return on Thursday vs. Washington.

             ""I’ve always felt like I’m a winning player. Like I deserved it to be in the playoffs – to be battling,"" Walker said. ""That’s what it will be all about in the future."" The Hornets listened to offers for Kemba at the trade deadline, and these comments will only fuel the speculation that next season could be his last as a Hornet -- he has one year left on his deal for a mere $12 million. If Charlotte doesn't take a major step in 2018-19, Walker will be an obvious trade candidate because they can't afford to let him walk for nothing.

             ""I'm just playing basketball and having fun,"" he said. ""If that means showcase, then that's fine, but I think I'm going out there just doing what I love to do."" Noel has played 20.7 minutes per game in March and has made his presence felt on defense with 8.1 rebounds, 2.1 steals and 1.0 blocks. Unfortunately, he also has four DNPs in March and it's expected to be his turn to rest on Friday vs. the Wolves -- he's currently rotating games with Salah Mejri.

             ""I hope to play a few minutes against Portland [Friday],"" Gallinari said. ""The hand is not completely healed, but we’ll see how I can help the team in the games left in the regular season. I will try to bite the bullet for the playoff race. The franchise asked me to grit my teeth and play. I will try to do that."" Gallinari has been getting a lot of shots up, but coach Doc Rivers said back on Tuesday that he hasn't taken contact yet. It's safe to assume he'll have restrictions, so Gallo will be hard to trust in his first game back.

He had his cast replaced by a splint recently, so he's been able to do some light exercises with his thumb. Smart was given a timetable of 6-8 weeks on March 16, so he should be able to hit his target date if he doesn't have any setbacks.

             The Wizards will no longer hold a morning shootaround, so we may not get an update on Wall's status until closer to tip-off. Wall has gone through a couple full contact practices, but he's shaping up to be a game-time call. If he is cleared to play, Wall will likely have heavy restrictions and we could see him sitting out one game of their upcoming back-to-back set on Saturday and Sunday. Tomas Satoransky will be the biggest loser once Wall returns, but he has definitely earned a larger role.

Allen would like to play in the Summer League this offseason, but his No. 1 goal is to bulk up.  ""I know they want me lifting a lot of weights,"" he added. Still just 19 years old, the future is very bright and he'll try to build off his 15-point game with eight rebounds, one assist, one steal and one block on Saturday vs. Miami.

The Lakers will obviously play it safe with their prized No. 2 pick, though, so owners should consider alternatives for Friday's game vs. the Bucks -- for now, we'll consider Ball questionable. If he misses time, expect Alex Caruso, Tyler Ennis and possibly Josh Hart (hand) to pick up the slack in the backcourt.

             Randle has now scored 20+ points with 9+ rebounds in nine consecutive games. For perspective, only five players have recorded longer streaks since the 2013-14 season -- Giannis Antetokounmpo, Karl-Anthony Towns, DeMarcus Cousins, Pau Gasol and Kevin Love (twice). Randle will likely have a harder time maintaining that production with Brandon Ingram back in the lineup, but he's still on a tremendous roll to finish his 2017-18 campaign. He won't come cheap in fantasy leagues next season.

             The Lakers had Ingram on a minute-limit tonight, predictably, but it's safe to assume that will be eased over the next few games -- L.A. hosts the Bucks on Friday and the Kings on Sunday. Ingram hasn't played since Mar. 1 and plenty of owners had to cut him to survive the rigors of the fantasy season, so make sure he's not on any waiver wires.

             Caruso wound up missing four games and his return was welcome news for L.A.'s backcourt. Isaiah Thomas (hip surgery) is done for the season, so Caruso should assume a steady role behind Lonzo Ball. He could even find himself starting in the near future because Ball exited tonight's game with a bruised left knee -- if you need a guard in a deep league, it makes sense to speculatively add him.

             Brandon Ingram (hip) returned to the starting lineup tonight, but Kuzma's role didn't take a big hit -- only Brook Lopez and Kentavious Caldwell-Pope logged more minutes for L.A. Head coach Luke Walton said before the game that he wants to give Kuzma minutes at both SF and PF, too, which should buoy his playing time even as Ingram's restrictions are eased.

I’ve only missed one game all season. I signed a two-year contract because I wanted to play two more years."" He played in both games during the Mavs' back-to-back set on Tuesday and Wednesday, and it looks like he'll be spared any precautionary DNPs -- the 39-year-old has been a true value-pick for owners who gambled on draft day.

Plan accordingly.

             Mavs owner Mark Cuban said recently that DSJ ""looks like a 10-year veteran"" these days, and coach Rick Carlisle also didn't stint on the praise. ""In some ways he’s really exceeded expectations,"" Carlisle said. ""In game 74 a lot of rookie point guards with the responsibility of starting would be worn down mentally, really banged up physically. He’s neither. He’s very strong, has worked very hard on his body. His mind is fresh."" Ideally that will help Smith Jr. avoid any DNPs, but it can't hurt to check his status prior to the Mavs' final seven games.

Powell's minutes have plummeted to just 23.5 per game in March, from 29.1 in February, and there's no reason to trust him for fantasy value right now.

Payton is dealing with tendinopathy, for which the only real prescription is rest, but he did warm up tonight before ultimately deciding not to play. Ulis is a solid streaming option and could hold value even if/when Payton does return -- over the past four games he's averaging 16.8 points, 5.3 assists, 2.8 boards, 1.3 triples and 0.8 steals.

He's been one of the most frustrating players to own in recent memory, but we can't ignore his recent production -- ride him until the wheels fall off.

             Jackson has now scored 15+ points in eight consecutive games, which is the longest streak by a Suns rookie since Richard Dumas in 1993. Phoenix is giving him unfettered minutes and offensive looks, and he's cashing in with 21.0 points, 6.5 rebounds, 3.0 assists and 1.7 steals over the past two weeks. He's tanking FT% in that span with 61.5% on a whopping 6.5 attempts per game, but it's a flaw most owners can accept for his all-around production.

Elfrid Payton (knee) is currently day-to-day but if he gets ruled out for future games, Harrison makes for an interesting pickup -- the Suns might also be inclined to sit Payton, who is in the doghouse and heading toward free agency. Tyler Ulis is still the guy to own while Payton is out, of course.

             Rivers hit one 3-pointer in 33 minutes of action, and the Clippers used a late 18-0 run to blow past the Suns for a win in Phoenix tonight. Fantasy owners who grabbed Rivers this season look very smart, as he's averaging career-highs in scoring (15.4 points per game), triples (2.3), assists (3.7), rebounds (2.5) and steals (1.2). He's also committed a modest 1.7 turnovers in 33.8 minutes per game, giving him steady top-100 value in roto leagues, and should rack up even more assists with Milos Teodosic (foot) on the mend.

They have two games remaining this week, and seven games total, so keep them locked into active lineups.

             He was the primary ball-handler on the last offensive possession, creating a nice hockey assist to open up a clean look for Jaylen Brown. Larkin played just 39 minutes combined in his last two, but we all know coach Brad Stevens will play the matchups. With so many injuries, Larkin should get minutes in the upper 20s most nights, making him a stream or DFS play.

             Coach Brad Stevens went with Ojeleye more than expected, but that could definitely change the next time out. The Celtics continue to get production from unexpected guys, but Ojeleye won't be asked to score enough to be trusted in fantasy.

             He is going to be more involved in the offense with all of these injuries. Per 36 without Kyrie Irving, Tatum posted 17.6 points, 6.1 boards, 2.2 dimes, 1.1 steals and 1.4 treys on 47.9 percent from the field. He's out of his slump with 17.4 points per game over his last five, so Tatum should be in for a strong finish.

             It was a tough matchup for the Dancing Bear. Coach Brad Stevens mixes up his frontcourt rotation as much as anyone -- Erik Spoelstra is close -- which means it's tough to lean on Yabusele. The Celtics also have a very light schedule coming up.

             Al Horford not playing was obviously a big factor. It's possible that the Celtics sit Horford out again, but they have a light schedule for the next five games with only one game -- Saturday vs. Toronto. Monroe is only a speculative add in deeper leagues.

            Lonzo Ball (knee contusion) will not return against the Mavs on Wednesday.
        
        
             He banged knees with Dirk Nowitzki and limped to the bench. Lonzo had a wrap on his leg for about seven minutes, but then took it off. A few minutes later, he went back to the locker room and was later ruled out. It didn't look bad, but this is to the same knee that kept him out earlier this season. If he's out, that means we'll see more Alex Caruso, Tyler Ennis and maybe Josh Hart on Friday.

             A lot of Western Conference teams may consider sending him a gift basket for this shot. Coach Brad Stevens gets credit here for drawing up another ATO (after time out) play to help the Celtics sweep their four-game West Coast trip (video in link below). As for Brown, he's healthy now and he should see more chances to score while Kyrie Irving and company are out.

             It's his 41st 20-point game of his career to tie him with Dame Lillard and Tyreke Evans for their rookie totals during their first seasons. Mitchell is already one of the best, most-creative scorer in the NBA, and Mitchell now has seven straight games with more than 20 points. The Jazz are finally somewhat cold with three losses in their last five games, which only gives them a 1.0-game lead over the Clippers for the No. 8 seed. Get ready for a fun finish and Mitchell's fantasy owners should expect massive minutes the rest of the way.

He's a little matchup dependent, but he's still worth owning in standard leagues.

Crowder continues to be a steal for the Jazz and he's a much better fit than Rodney Hood. His fantasy ceiling isn't too high, so he's more of a streamer than anything else.

             He was also reportedly not walking around well after the game. After a fall in the first half, it was clearly bothering him in the first half, but he looked fine for most of the second half. Kanter is off for a couple days, so we'll see if he feels better for Saturday against the Pistons. If he's not, that could mean we see some Luke Kornet out there.

             Brooks just signed a 10-day contract on Tuesday and this was his first NBA action since the 2013-14 season when he played for the Celtics, Warriors and Lakers. He played with complete confidence in 21 minutes tonight, and his efforts helped Memphis earn an upset win vs. the Blazers -- granted, it was costly since they're now tied with Atlanta after two straight wins. The Grizzlies are a mess due to injuries and tanking, but maybe Brooks will be a sneaky source of scoring and 3-pointers down the stretch. Most owners can take a wait-and-see approach here, though.

             Memphis was rolling down the stretch and took a 32-22 advantage in the fourth quarter, so coach J.B. Bickerstaff used the opportunity to give Gasol some rest. Fantasy owners should just be thankful that he's not being shut down or rested more often, although we expect at least one more DNP-CD during a back-to-back set on April 8-9.

             Andrew Harrison (right wrist/left shoulder) was sidelined and Tyreke Evans (personal) was out again tonight due to a family matter. Harrison sounds day-to-day, but it's anyone's guess when or if Evans will return this season. Reserve guard Kobi Simmons wound up logging 28 minutes, and Chalmers also played less than Wayne Selden (23 minutes) and MarShon Brooks (21 minutes), so he's not worth owning even as a starter.

            Wayne Selden chipped in 10 points (4-of-8 FGs, 1-of-3 FTs), two assists, one steal and one rebound in 23 minutes on Wednesday.
        
        
             It wasn't a great line, but Selden once again hit double-digit scoring -- he's scored 10+ points in six of the past seven games, after doing it just 10 times previously in his career. He doesn't offer much versatility, though, and will need to be extremely efficient to hold value with minutes in the mid-20s. Given his current role, he's best suited to deeper formats.

             ""Of course, I want to do more and play more, but I’m just trying to make the most of the things I can control,"" Parsons said before the game. He certainly maximized his minutes tonight, and showed flashes of his pre-injury self, but his restrictions are too extreme to bother with him in fantasy leagues.

Teague has felt Tyus Jones behind him all season, but coach Tom Thibodeau doesn't seem like he'll be making any changes the rest of the way. With the Wolves fighting for the playoffs, Teague should be good to go until the last couple games of the season.

             McCollum took full advantage of Damian Lillard's absence tonight, adding five dimes, three rebounds, three 3-pointers and one assist -- incredibly, the Blazers still lost to the lowly Grizzlies. McCollum gets a massive 7.5% increase in usage when Lillard is off the court, but then again Dame almost never sits out -- he only missed tonight's game for the birth of his child. Regardless, it was great to see McCollum erupt after a lousy 3-of-19 shooting performance on Tuesday.

             Those points set a franchise record for a game to top Mo Williams' 52, and it's just the fourth game over 50 (Kevin Love, Corey Brewer). Towns is also the youngest player since Shaquille O'Neal in 1994 to put up a 50-15 line in a game. At multiple points this season, it was head-scratching to see coach Tom Thibodeau limit KAT's usage, so maybe those days will be few and far between. Additionally, a viral video from last night was flying around the internet with Ben Simmons saying KAT had ""plenty of time"" to keep playing PUGB because he was facing the Hawks (video in link below). Towns still hasn't missed a game yet, so he's apparently doing something right with his down time.

             Coach Tom Thibodeau dropped his minutes for three of the previous four games, so the playing time being high again is a great sign. However, Jimmy Butler (knee) is getting close to a return and it feels like he can take on contact any day now. Bjelica should have at least one more useful game on Friday against the Mavs and perhaps Sunday against Utah, but most owners will be dropping him after Sunday because Butler would likely be back for Thursday against the Nuggets.

The Hawks sitting Dennis Schroder in a non-back-to-back set is big news for this game, and now that the Grizzlies won again that could make them motivated to rest him again. Taylor is still more of a speculative add until we get word of Schroder sitting out again, but it's not a bad idea to hold him in standard leagues.

Jonathon Simmons (wrist) and Jonathan Isaac (foot) were both out again, Evan Fournier (knee) is doubtful to return this season, and even Wesley Iwundu (illness) was out tonight. That leaves Purvis with a path to some playing time, assuming Simmons and Isaac miss more time, but he's best left on the wire in almost any scenario.

             Mack recently said his role is to ""settle down"" Orlando's young second unit, and coach Frank Vogel looks for him to set a tone. ""We want to play with the pass and everybody is reminded of that multiples times throughout the day,"" Vogel said. ""In the stretches where we looked really good, it was mostly done with the pass."" Mack continues to share the PG duties with D.J. Augustin (14 points, three assists in 32 minutes), but Augustin is the guy to own for fantasy.

             Hezonja's minutes have spiked the past few games, and he's a lock for heavy minutes while Jonathon Simmons (wrist) and Jonathan Isaac (foot) are sidelined. ""We want [Hezonja] to always be aggressive,"" said coach Frank Vogel. ""The way he played at the beginning of last year, he looked like he didn’t belong in the league. And now he’s got a far better feel for all of this stuff ... His defense and his habits have been more consistent as the season has gone along."" There's enough upside here to plug him into all active lineups while Orlando is short-handed.

             Harris added one block in 27 minutes of action, doing enough to satisfy owners who scooped him up after Sunday's 30-point eruption. That was an obvious fluke, but as long as he's getting 25+ minutes per game he should carve out low-end roto value.

He's also averaging 2.3 blocks for the past week, and is quietly having a nice finish despite signs of 'rookie wall' exhaustion. Assuming he adds some muscle this summer and works on his conditioning, he should be poised for a big sophomore campaign in fantasy leagues.

             The ankle issue didn't seem to limit him with some of his usual highlight reel dunks. He'll get Thursday off before he takes on the 76ers on Friday, and perhaps he can get to 30 minutes.

            Jeff Green scored 18 points on Wednesday, making 6-of-15 field goals and 5-of-5 free throws with one rebound, one assist and one steal in 32 minutes.
        
        
             This was Green's fifth-highest scoring game of the season, and it follows two duds in which he averaged 5.0 points on 26.7% shooting. His role will increase if Kevin Love (concussion) misses more games, but there should still be higher-upside options on your waiver wire.

             Korver is mourning the death of his brother and it's unclear when he might return. Rodney Hood, J.R. Smith and Jordan Clarkson are combining to cover his minutes, but there are no obvious pickups here.

            Tristan Thompson had just two points, three rebounds and one assist in 16 minutes vs. Charlotte on Wednesday.
        
        
             Kevin Love (concussion) was out of commission tonight and it's unclear when he'll return -- he needs to clear the league's strenuous concussion protocol. Even if he does miss more games, though, there are no guarantees Thompson will earn more starts -- Cleveland could go smaller vs. teams like the Pelicans (Friday) and Mavericks (Sunday). It's safe to leave Thompson on the wire in almost any format.

            J.R. Smith was great during Wednesday's road win, scoring 19 points on 8-of-9 shooting with five rebounds, three assists, three steals and one 3-pointer in 31 minutes.
        
        
             Smith was really aggressive and scored eight points in the paint before halftime, which is very unusual. His scoring helped Cleveland pick up the win, and he could earn more minutes if Kyle Korver (personal) is out longer, but he's not a reliable fantasy target -- in his previous two games, he averaged 3.0 points without any assists, steals or blocks.

             LBJ has scored 10+ points in 866 consecutive games, tying Michael Jordan, and he also passed Kevin Garnett for the 17th-most steals in NBA history.

             Hood walked with a slight limp going into the locker room, but it's not immediately clear what was bothering him. We're leaving him off the injury report for now, but deep-league owners should confirm his status prior to Friday's game vs. the Pelicans.

             Osman missed nearly three weeks with the injury and his return is great news for Cleveland as they try to maintain the No. 3 seed ahead of Philly and Indiana. His presence is less important for fantasy owners, though, since he'll basically just steal a handful of minutes from guys like Jeff Green and Rodney Hood.

             He's instant excitement for the Wells Fargo Center crowd with plenty of ""Fultz"" chants since his return. The No. 1 pick been a play-maker in both of his games with 15 dimes in just 28 minutes ,and he's making an impact on defense. He's going to struggled scoring efficiently and any made free throw is a win for the rookie -- he went 1-of-2 tonight. He could be a decent counting stat guy in deep leagues, but it's still tough to rely on a guy that's played just 14 minutes per game and is backing up a minutes monster in Ben Simmons.

He also set franchise records with 48 consecutive made free throws and 2,004 total free throws -- he's been a cornerstone for Charlotte since he was drafted in 2011, which is why it was surprising to hear him mentioned in trade rumors this season.

             Batum returned from a four-game absence on Monday and the Hornets kept him on a minute-limit tonight. That should continue to increase in coming games, but Charlotte isn't about to risk a major injury with only six games remaining and no realistic chance to make the playoffs.

             That's still some solid efficiency and it was hardly a letdown from his 42-point explosion.

             He did have a fall in the second half and was grabbing his head, but he stayed in the game. Hardaway Jr. continues to play with a lot of tape on his shoulder, but it's not affecting his playing time. Keep rolling him out there in all leagues despite how he can have duds like this one.

             He did have a minor injury in the first half, but played through it. Kanter landed on his lower back and remained down, but he didn't leave the game after shooting free throws. He's had back problems before this season, so his fantasy owners will want to make sure he's OK for the next one. Although, the Knicks really have nothing to tank for because they almost certainly can't catch the Bulls.

Kyle O'Quinn continues to get ruled out early, and it's worth a mention Enes Kanter may have hurt his back again today -- he played through it. Just keep an eye on The UniKornet if both KOQ and Kanter are out.

             He only scored 10 points in the first three quarters, went into one of his high-usage modes in the fourth. Mudiay is probably going to be coming off the bench going forward, and he's still too inconsistent to use when he's starting. He's more of a stream for those looking for points and don't care about efficiency.

             The Mavs will have Dirk Nowitzki, Dwight Powell and Nerlens Noel available in the frontcourt, so Mejri probably wouldn't play even if he was on the active roster. All signs point to this being a precautionary DNP-CD, so we're not reading much into his bruised knee.

             He did not play on Tuesday night due to a knee issue and it may have been due to a back-to-back set. His minutes have slightly dropped due to the Mavs having some depth, and Nerlens Noel is taking run from him. Powell is probably still worth owning, but he's not a must-own player anymore.

             The ageless wonder once again doesn't sit in a back-to-back set, which is unconventional to how a lot bad teams are playing. Nowitzki has been a value in fantasy all season and there's no indication he'll get rest going forward.

             This confirms that the game notes was onto something. It's being called tendinitis and maybe this is why he's struggled lately. Coach Jay Triano did say Payton will start if everything goes OK in warmups, which is noteworthy because Tyler Ulis has outplayed Payton. We like Ulis tonight regardless.

             That's a rough one for Horford's fantasy owners with how the schedule works for the Celtics. Not playing tonight means at most he'll only play in one game from Mar. 27 until Apr. 2 -- Boston plays the Raptors on Saturday. Yabusele should be a fun one to watch, and he'll likely match up against Derrick Favors. Horford is actually a cut candidate if you need games right now.

             He got knocked in the noggin pretty good after getting tangled up with Markelle Fultz on a screen, and he'll end his evening with five points, three boards and one turnover in nine minutes. It didn't look like the type of injury that will cost him multiple games, and he reportedly passed initial concussion tests, so it could be worse. We should get more than a few updates on Embiid leading up to Friday's game in Atlanta.

             Chalmers could get some decent run at the one with Harrison and Tyreke Evans (personal) out tonight, so he might be someone to consider as a punt play in DFS. Joining him in the starting five will be Dillon Brooks, Jarell Martin, JaMychal Green and Marc Gasol.

             His head hit Markelle Fultz's head and/or shoulder as Fultz was trying to around Embiid. The big man was down for a minute and had the training staff walk him back to the locker room. He's likely being evaluated for a concussion right now. We should see a lot of Richaun Holmes until Embiid is back.

             The Warriors basically rested Green on Tuesday, so he was likely going to be back for this one. That said, Green has dealt with a lot of smaller injuries and the Warriors basically aren't playing for anything, so Green will eventually get games off. Jordan Bell and Kevon Looney take a hit here.

             Lee was able to get through shootaround, which means he's making progress, but whether he plays or not does not change the fact that he should not be owned in fantasy hoops. Trey Burke, Frank Ntilikina and Tim Hardaway Jr. will divvy up his minutes tonight.

Hood's been hot over the past two, and his odds of keeping that going improve as a starter, so he could be worth a look for anyone seeking some points and triples.

             He still saw 26 minutes on Tuesday, but that number could drop with Cedi Osman now available to take some minutes. Calderon being on a back-to-back set could also be a factor here, so he isn't a DFS play today.

             Batum's minutes should gradually increase over the week, although there's a chance he sits out either Saturday or Sunday's game with that being a back-to-back. Still, he's capable of churning out value when earning minutes in the mid-20s, so owners can feel free to get him active.

             It's bad news for Milos after multiple injuries to his left plantar fascia. After the injury last night, there's a very good chance he'll be out for at least the rest of the regular season. That should get Tyrone Wallace back in the mix while there could be more minutes going to Wes Johnson and Sindarius Thornwell.

             As per usual, it's fairly standard protocol for teams to list players as questionable the day after an injury and on a day that the team is giving an MRI. In other words, don't put too much stock into this update. We should have a more official update from the Spurs later today. If LMA is out, expect Pau Gasol, Patty Mills and Dejounte Murray to have to score more while Joffrey Lauvergne, Davis Bertans and Kyle Anderson would have to play more.

With Isaiah Thomas (hip) our for the season, Hart could find himself seeing minutes in the 30s. He's worth a look if you needed a guard.

             Booker is basically going in the wrong direction here and didn't practice yesterday. Booker jammed his hand on Mar. 14, and he was out there on Mar. 15 against the Jazz. He was also doing some pre-game warmups last week, but now he continues to get ruled out early. Expect Troy Daniels to chuck 10-15 treys, Josh Jackson to play a bunch, and Tyler Ulis to step up as a ball-handler.

             The ankle issue are back for Len and it's possible he misses more time here. Alan Williams is back and played 16 minutes in his return on Monday, so maybe he can get to 20 minutes tonight. The Suns will likely have to run a tight rotation with Len, Devin Booker (hand) and T.J. Warren (knee) out, so there could be some value in DFS tonight.

             The Lakers get some good news for their second-year forward. Ingram is going to have a minutes limit tonight, which is hardly a surprise after he's been out since Mar. 1. Ingram's return should slightly cut into Julius Randle and Kyle Kuzma getting shots, and this means Travis Wear could be out of the rotation. It makes sense to add Ingram where available, especially if you're punting percentages.

It's a tough blow for Thomas, who will be fetching offers on the open market as a free agent this summer, and he's assuredly done for the season. Cut him. Lonzo Ball will be logging heavy minutes moving forward with Tyler Ennis serving as his primary backup.

             Whiteside has spent the past three weeks on the sidelines, but this is the first time he's gone through any sort of live competitive work since going down with the hip issue. If he is able to play Thursday, he'll likely have a minutes limit, but Whiteside presents enough upside that even with a minutes cap he's worth a speculative add in most leagues with two possible games this week. His return would hurt Kelly Olynyk and James Johnson.

Aron Baynes would also see an uptick in minutes, but Monroe is the more attractive target here.

            Tyler Ulis said that he finally feels fully recovered from the back issues that sidelined him for 10 games earlier this season.
        
        
             ""I feel like now I’m back to… being a lot more healthy and I can tell by my movement. I’m able to do a lot better,"" Ulis said. ""I feel like I’m being more patient... being more aggressive. Just playing free. Playing with confidence."" Ulis has played well over the past three, putting in averages of 14.7 points, 6.3 dimes, 1.0 steal and 3.0 turnovers per game on 51.4% shooting. His contract for next season isn't guaranteed, so he's playing for a roster spot. He's on the radar in deep leagues.

             Purvis' second 10-day contract expired today, so Orlando inked him to a two-year deal with the second season non-guaranteed. He randomly scored 19 points last Thursday, but then followed that up with a six-point dud. He'll be too inconsistent to be worth owning in most settings.

            John Wall (knee) is traveling with the team to Detroit and is officially listed as ""questionable"" for Thursday's game.
        
        
             Wall has officially gone through two, full-contact practices, and he'll go through shootaround on Thursday. He's likely headed for a game-time call, but there's a realistic chance he could make it back to the court tomorrow following an eight-week absence, so he's worth a speculative add in deep leagues. He'll likely have restrictions, but even at 20 minutes a night, he should do enough to be worth owning. If he does play Thursday, he'll likely sit on Saturday with it being the first of a back-to-back set. Tomas Satoransky's value will take a huge hit upon Wall's return.

             Green was having trouble keeping food down, but in typical Draymond-fashion, he still wanted to get out there. Honestly, he'd probably want to play even if both of his feet were broken. Kidding aside, he has another full day to rest up ahead of Thursday's game against the Bucks, so maybe he'll be able to get back out there tomorrow following a three-game stint on the sidelines. We'll have another update by Thursday's morning's shootaround, at the latest.

""The body of work, how I'm doing it, what's been happening with our team all year long, how we've got so many injuries and things of that nature, guys in and out, to be able to still keep this thing afloat, I definitely would vote me."" James makes a solid point, and honestly, he's been a perennial MVP candidate since 2006; but it'll be James Harden taking home the award.

Check back closer to tip-off for official confirmation on Kidd-Gilchrist's status.

He could eat away at some of Frank Ntilikina's minutes, but either way, Mudiay isn't worth rostering in most scenarios.

            Isaiah Whitehead (sprained right wrist) has been ruled out for Wednesday's game against the Magic.
        
        
             Whitehead is a negligible part of the rotation in Brooklyn, so his absence from tonight's game won't have any meaningful consequences in fantasy hoops.

            Tom Thibodeau said that Jimmy Butler (knee) has been doing ""great"" in his rehab, and he's going through two rehab sessions a day, but he's still not been cleared for contact.
        
        
             Butler is currently going through Week-5 of his loose 4-6 timetable that was provided by Shams Charania of Yahoo! Sports, but with him still not taking contact, it looks like he's going to be much closer to that six-week mark. If your fantasy season ends at Week-24, Butler is more of a liability than an asset at this point.

             Kevin Love may have suffered a concussion and will be re-evaluated on Wednesday, and if he's out, Jeff Green, Nance and Thompson are all going to see extra minutes on Wednesday against the Hornets. The Cavs are in must-win mode with the Sixers just a 1/2 game back for the No. 3 seed and we'd rank these guys as Green, Nance and Thompson if Love's going to miss time. Stay tuned.

             Williams also turned the ball over seven times for the second time this season, adding five rebounds with four assists, one steal and one triple in 37 minutes. It's hard to complain about a player who has shattered his ADP with early-round value on the season and who averaged 26.5 points in his previous two games, so we're not going to. Expect a better performance on Wednesday vs. the Suns in what is shaping up to be a dream matchup. He'll also have to handle the ball even more if Milos Teodosic (foot) misses time.

             Oladipo was the lone bright spot for the Pacers, but he was all they needed against a team without Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant, Draymond Green and Klay Thompson that has nothing left to play for, except for getting the stars healthy. Dipo went down in a heap in the final two minutes of the game and had his mouth bloodied, but like the stud he is, wiped it up, stayed in the game to hit some free throws, and finished it out. The Pacers have a decent shot at passing both the Sixers and Cavaliers to be the No. 3 seed in the East, so it's going to take a lot more than a shot to the mouth to keep Dipo down. The Pacers have a great chance to gain ground on Thursday at Sacramento, but then travel to the Clippers and Nuggets, and then get a somewhat healthy Warriors again in Indy next Thursday, followed by a trip to Toronto. Yikes. Oladipo should continue to come up big for one of the league's most pleasant surprises this season.

             Harris also nailed three triples to go with five assists, three rebounds and two steals in 37 minutes. Danilo Gallinari (hand) will miss at least one more game for the Clippers, but could be back on Friday vs. Portland. Maybe he loses a few shots, but Harris has been an early-round fantasy asset since his move to Los Angeles and it's hard to imagine anything slowing him down with the way he's been playing.

             Wallace had some really nice moments back in February, but a foot injury during his time in the G-League slowed him down. He does have a path to minutes with Milos Teodosic (foot) going down again, so keep an eye on him. In his previous two games with the Clippers on Feb. 23 and Feb. 27, Wallace put up 15.5 points, 5.0 rebounds and 4.5 assists.

             This was a huge win for the Pacers, but if you look at the box score, it's pretty clear that a healthy Warriors team would have likely mopped the floor with them. Collison and Myles Turner were both awful and it was up to Victor Oladipo to carry them, which he did. In Collins' defense, he was playing well coming into this one and just never got it going against the Dubs. He'd scored in double figures in six of his previous seven games and had a nice double-double on Friday. He'll look to bounce back against the Kings on Thursday, which also happens to be a revenge game for him.

             Terry got the start again, but this line has fluke written all over it. Sure he's valuable in real life for his floor spacing, but Terry was averaging just 4.2 points in March before this little outburst. He's safe to ignore, starting or not.

             Sure, Turner's had a decent season and is currently worthy of a late fourth-round fantasy pick, but this season has had its share of ups and downs. And when he's down, he's been pretty far down. Had Turner come out of the gates and played like we expected him to all year, it's hard to imagine where the Pacers would be. As it stands, they're just a 1/2 game back of the Cavaliers for the No. 3 seed and essentially tied with the Sixers, but if the season ended now the Pacers would be the No. 5 seed. As for Turner, that makes three straight games with seven or fewer points (on 5-of-23 shooting), but at least he's still blocking shots and (usually) grabbing some rebounds. But there's little doubt he's been highly frustrating to own for much of the season - especially now that the fantasy playoffs are in full swing. He'll look to bounce back on Thursday against the Kings.

             That's his third game of the season with 5+ blocks and the seventh of his career. Giannis didn't have much help tonight, so his heroic effort was wasted. He hit 10-of-16 shots from the field, though he was just 5-of-9 from the line with four turnovers. With three more games on the schedule this week, Giannis will be carrying a lot of owners to fantasy basketball glory.

             He'd been out for six games, looked pretty good and arrived just as Trevor Booker went down with a possible badly sprained right ankle. As long as Myles Turner is healthy, Sabonis is a risky fantasy play, but the playoff-bound Pacers are thrilled to have him back. The Pacers sit in the No. 5 spot in the East, but are essentially tied with the No. 4 Sixers and just a 1/2 game behind the No. 3 Cavaliers. There's a long way to go before a lot of these playoff races are officially decided.

             Jordan Bell suffered some kind of lower limb discomfort tonight that forced him to the locker room at one point, while the rest of the Golden State's stars were all in street clothes again. That certainly helped Looney's cause, but he played really well. Bell was able to play through his issue and Kevin Durant is due back on Thursday, so this could end up being a one-hit wonder for Looney. Then again, the Dubs are locked into the No. 2 seed in the West, so the Warriors have the luxury of resting guys as much as they want until the end of the season. If Bell ends up missing time, Looney's probably worth grabbing.

            Jordan Bell had four points, seven rebounds, three assists and four blocks on 2-of-7 shooting in Tuesday's loss to the Pacers, but also went to the locker room with an apparent leg problem.
        
        
             He was able to come back and play through it, but for a majority of the time he was on the floor he was limping and looked a little gimpy. With the fact he played through it and there was no definitive injury, chances are he'll be fine for Thursday against the Bucks. Owners will want to double check his status and make sure he's playing, while also considering that Kevin Durant should be back for that one. Steve Kerr said of Bell after the game, ""I think he's fine. Obviously he was limping a bit, but he's OK.""

            De'Aaron Fox had another night to forget on Tuesday vs. the Mavericks, scoring five points on 2-of-10 shots.
        
        
             He missed all three of his 3-point attempts, but only turned the ball over once with six assists, three boards and a block in 25 minutes. Fox is in the middle of a rough stretch and is averaging just 9.4 points, 3.4 assists, 3.0 rebounds, 1.0 steals and 2.6 turnovers over his last five games. Even with three games coming up from Thursday-Sunday, Fox is a risky play in category leagues because of his inefficiency.

             It wasn't all good news, as WCS hit 3-of-6 free throws and his shot-blocking drought continued -- he's gone four straight games without a block and doesn't have a block in nine out of 14 games in March. With three more games this week, hopefully WCS will be able to build off this performance.

             Zach Randolph (illness, rest) was a DNP for the third straight game, but he wasn't on the injury report tonight unlike his previous two. That means we could see him at some point this week, but Labissiere is clearly the PF to own in Sacramento. He added eight rebounds with three assists, one block and zero turnovers, and if he's on your wire you can take advantage of Sacramento's favorable schedule -- they play three games from Thursday to Sunday.

             Had his shot been falling, the line would have looked pretty sweet. Props to Dirk for finishing out a lost season in Dallas, as he's expected to play on Wednesday against the Lakers, as well.

That means he was simply a healthy scratch so that the Kings could take a longer look at Skal Labissiere. We might see him get some minutes on Thursday vs. the Pacers, but we'd be shocked if he didn't get more DNPs moving forward.

             He should sit on Wednesday against the Lakers, as it will be Nerlens Noel's turn to play center for the Mavs. Noel is probably worth using when he's going to play, but the same can't be said for Mejri.

             J.J. Barea sat this one out for personal reasons and could miss more time, and Yogi Ferrell played just 19 minutes. The Mavericks would be wise to give the young Harrison a look now that the games don't matter, but he didn't play on Saturday and scored six points on Thursday, so it's hard to see him becoming trustworthy in fantasy unless the Mavs start him the rest of the way. Just keep an eye on him.

             Two teams with nothing to play for and a box score that isn't fantasy friendly, although Smith came through with a solid line, despite the lack of steals. He also hit 4-of-4 free throws after scoring 21 points with five boards, six assists and two 3-pointers on Saturday. He missed a couple games with a sprained ankle, but has looked good in his last two and the Mavericks should keep running him out there as long as he's healthy.

             His left foot is the reason why he missed a big chunk of games earlier this season, so this is a really tough blow for the Clippers. We don't know the severity yet, but his fantasy owners should be evaluating some waiver-wire options. Austin Rivers and Lou Williams are already locked into big minutes, so it will be interesting to see if coach Doc Rivers turns to Tyrone Wallace or Jawun Evans. Teodosic will undergo an MRI on Wednesday afternoon, so check back then for an update.

            Nikola Mirotic (hip) returned to action on Tuesday vs. the Blazers, but didn't make an impact with two points and four rebounds on 1-of-6 shooting.
        
        
             He played just 20 minutes and it's clear that he's nowhere close to 100 percent. Mirotic was cold prior to this dud, so fantasy owners should be evaluating other options on the wire since the Pelicans are off until Friday. Hopefully the time off will do him some good.

             J-Rich has been in a bit of a funk recently but played very well tonight, looking more like the guy owners had come to trust this season. Even with his shaky play of late, he's still averaging 11.6 points, 3.8 rebounds, 3.8 assists, 1.6 steals, 1.2 blocks and 1.0 3-pointers over his last five.

            Anthony Davis put up a monster effort in Tuesday's 107-103 loss to the Blazers with 36 points, 14 rebounds, four assists, two steals and six blocks.
        
        
             Davis did have a scary fall and rolled his right ankle, but he never went to the locker room and checked back into the game just a few moments later. He finished 15-of-24 from the field and hit all six free throws and continues to carry his fantasy owners in the playoffs. Since he entered the NBA, Davis has 12 games with 30+ points, 10+ rebounds and 5+ blocks, while the next closest player has just two. The Pelicans are off until Friday, so he'll have a few days to rest his ankle.

             Johnson was left for dead in fantasy a few weeks ago, but has been killing it for the most part. He had a three-point dud last Wednesday, but is still averaging 17.4 points, 7.6 rebounds, 4.4 assists, 0.8 steals, 1.0 blocks and 1.6 3-pointers on 64 percent shooting over his last five. Johnson has to be owned everywhere right now.

             Despite dealing with a back issue, Nurkic has actually seen his minutes increase lately. He's now played 27+ minutes in five straight games, averaging 17.4 points, 10.4 rebounds, 1.0 assists, 1.2 steals and 3.0 blocks in that span. He's peaking at the perfect time for fantasy owners and will have more shots coming his way on Wednesday vs. Memphis with Damian Lillard (paternity) out.

             LeBron didn't get any revenge on the Heat, and in fact got just the opposite, as they scored a season low in points and now sit just a 1/2 game over the Sixers for the No. 3 seed in the East. And with Kevin Love's possible concussion looming, the road's not going to get any easier for the Cavs. LeBron might just have to put the team on his back (where it's been all year), so look for him to go off against the Hornets on Wednesday night.

            Kevin Love exhibited concussion symptoms at halftime of Tuesday's game vs. the Heat.
        
        
             Love will be re-evaluated on Wednesday morning before a decision is made if he needs to enter the concussion protocol. If he doesn't get clearance, that means it will be safe to rule him out for Wednesday's game vs. the Hornets. Jeff Green played 31 minutes and would be very busy if Love is held out, while both Tristan Thompson and Larry Nance would be in the mix for more minutes. Nance easily has the most upside out of those three.

             We're hoping it's nothing more than an ankle sprain, but he was grabbing the back of his ankle and didn't exactly leave under his own power. If he's going to miss time, Myles Turner, Thaddeus Young and Domantas Sabonis would all see a few more minutes each night. The way Booker was helped off the court leads us to believe he won't return tonight.

             He shot just 3-of-13 from the field, but the counting stats were great. Aminu's minutes are now locked into the mid-30s with Moe Harkless (knee surgery) out indefinitely, but he was already worth owning before that news broke. In fact, he's been a top-80 player in standard 9-category leagues for the past month, averaging 10.0 points, 8.1 rebounds, 1.8 assists, 1.6 steals, 0.5 blocks and 2.1 triples.

             He was hot a week ago, but now has a pair of five-point games to go along with the DNP over his last three. The minutes were there and with Kevin Love leaving tonight with a loose front tooth (and possible concussion), it's a little surprising that Green didn't do more. He'll look to get it going again against the Hornets on Wednesday.

             He did salvage his bad shooting night by adding five assists, four rebounds, two blocks, one steal and a triple, and this was just his third game of the season with single-digit points. This is bad timing for owners in the fantasy playoffs, but there are reasons to be optimistic -- Damian Lillard (paternity) will miss Wednesday's game and McCollum gets a massive 7.7 usage rate bump with Lillard off the floor. He will be a very popular play in DFS vs. the Grizzlies.

             Anderson played well with 16 points, four 3-pointers and a full stat line on Saturday, but sat out on Sunday and really hasn't been doing much for the Rockets since returning from a hip injury.

             Damian Lillard (paternity) is going to miss Wednesday's game vs. the Memphis, but should be back in time for games on Friday and Sunday. That means Napier will have some excellent streaming appeal on Wednesday, but it won't be sustainable. As a fill-in starter this season, Napier has fared really well with averages of 18.4 points, 5.0 rebounds, 5.0 assists, 2.0 steals and 2.0 triples.

             Despite not having Harden or Clint Capela (rest), the Rockets ran circles around the Bulls in the 118-86 win and Gordon played lights out.

             Turner is looking at a significant bump in value, as Harkless likely won't return during the regular season and Damian Lillard (paternity) will miss Wednesday's game vs. the Grizzlies. Turner gets a 3.9 usage rate bump with Lillard off the floor and should easily eclipse the 30-minute mark once again on Wednesday in a great matchup. With three more games this week, Turner is a decent low-end pickup, but Shabazz Napier is probably a better streamer on Wednesday.

             Cristiano Felicio left early with a sore back so Vonleh and Bobby Portis (11 points, 8 boards) stepped up in his absence. Vonleh's worth a look if Felicio's going to miss time and is averaging a respectable 9.4 points, 9.2 rebounds, 1.0 steals and 1.2 3-pointers over his last five games. And with the Bulls still having three more games this week, he's probably going to be a hot pickup.

             Kris Dunn is still out with his toe injury and may not play again this season, while Payne saw a three-game double-digit scoring streak broken tonight. He played 23 minutes in the blowout and Jerian Grant hit just 1-of-9 shots in 18 minutes, so Payne's job should be secure going forward. But tonight's line from him was a textbook fantasy buzzkill for his owners.

For now, his fantasy owners can plan to have him back in their lineups on Friday vs. the Clippers and on Sunday in a rematch vs. Memphis. C.J. McCollum should be a monster play on Wednesday, Evan Turner should have some more ball-handling responsibility and Shabazz Napier will become an excellent streaming option as Lillard's likely replacement.

             Valentine and Sean Kilpatrick were the second leading scorers for the Bulls tonight, as most of the starters didn't come to play in this one. Valentine's been playing well and has scored in double figures in four straight games, but owners will want to continue to monitor news on his knee to make sure he's playing from night to night.

             The Blazers continue to solidify themselves as the No. 3 seed in the West, as this win pushes them 2.5 games ahead of the Thunder. Lillard scored 20 of his 41 points in the fourth quarter, finishing 18-of-33 from the field with nine rebounds, six assists, four steals and three triples in 42 minutes. Lillard is on baby watch with his girlfriend due to give birth day any day now, so fantasy owners should continue to monitor his availability for Portland's three remaining games this week.

             Well, hello there! Markkanen had only played one game in his previous seven chances and had nine points on 3-of-7 shooting in that one on Friday. It was tough to trust him tonight, and he was the only Bulls starter to show up, as David Nwaba, Cristiano Felicio (left with back injury), Cameron Payne and Justin Holiday combined for just 13 points on 5-of-24 shooting in the ugly loss. The Bulls are tankin' it up but if Markkanen's healthy enough to play, they  might just turn him loose the rest of the way. The Bulls have three more games this week, so Markkanen's likely to be a hot pickup.

             Barton had scored at least 22 points in three of his previous four games and had 16 in the other one, so this was not a typical night for him. Especially with Gary Harris still out with his knee injury. Harris is targeting a March 30 return, but Barton should still hold onto some value even when it happens.

             Chandler has hit 9-of-25 shots over his last three games and hasn't scored more than eight in any of them. He was cooking before that, and while the minutes are still there, his game just isn't following suit. The Nuggets have now lost two straight and sit 2.0 games behind the Timberwolves for the final playoff spot in the West, with the Clippers also sitting two games back.

             The Warriors listed Jordan Bell as the starter over an hour ago, so it doesn't sound like Green even attempted to warm up. His next chance to play is on Thursday, but the Warriors have been extra cautious with all their stars and have made it clear that they are just coasting until the playoffs start.

             He picked up four fouls and the box score for both teams was pretty weird tonight, and Morris has played very well in three straight games. The low minutes were a fluke, so look for them to be back in the 30s for Thursday's game against the Pistons. If everything goes Washington's way that night, they can clinch a playoff berth on Thursday.

             The box score for this game is bizarre, as both teams played everyone and almost all of the Wizards players saw at least 20 minutes, with only Markieff Morris, Jason Smith and Tim Frazier not getting at least 20 minutes of the 12 players who saw action. The Wizards snapped a three-game losing streak and had dropped five of seven games, but can still clinch a playoff berth as early as Thursday.

             LaMarcus Aldridge left with a knee injury tonight and Bertans saw a spike in minutes after it happened. But Gregg Popovich played his entire team double-digit minutes tonight, and it's hard to see Bertans doing much outside of the occasional solid stat line, with or without Aldridge.

             Gregg Popovich is like the honey badger, in that he just don't care. On a night when LaMarcus Aldridge left early with a knee contusion and in the midst of a playoff race, Pop played 13 guys, and none of them saw more than 26 minutes (Patty Mills) and none of them saw fewer than 11 minutes (Manu Ginobili). Gasol might see a boost if Aldridge is going to miss time, but Pop will probably just continue to spread the minutes around and make most of the team useless in fantasy. The Spurs are still 2.5 games in front of the Nuggets to stay in the playoffs.

He finished with one point and one rebound in just seven minutes. Jeff Green, Larry Nance and Tristan Thompson will pick up the slack for the remainder of the game.

             He took a shot to the face in the opening minute, went back to the locker room to get cleaned up and should be good to go for the rest of the evening.

             He tweaked his knee in the second quarter and was having trouble moving, so the Spurs will hold him out. LMA has already missed some action this season due to knee concerns, so his status for the remainder of the week could be in jeopardy. Pau Gasol started the second half and is arguably the best speculative pickup, assuming he's on the wire. Rudy Gay, Kyle Anderson and Davis Bertans should also be more involved. LMA finished with 13 points, four rebounds, two assists and one block.

             It's not clear when he picked up an injury, but it looked like he was holding his left knee or left quad and he wasn't moving very well. We should get an update at halftime, but look for Pau Gasol, Davis Bertans and Rudy Gay to step up offensively if Aldridge can't return.

             It's a strange decision, but maybe coach Erik Spoelstra wants to keep his second unit intact. Kelly Olynyk and James Johnson are still excellent options in DFS and season-long formats. In two previous starts this season, Mickey played just 14.0 minutes per game.

             Valentine banged his knee on Saturday vs. Detroit and there was some doubt that he would play after missing practice on Monday. However, the swelling in his knee has improved, so fantasy owners can pencil him into their lineups. He's been on fire lately, averaging 17.5 points, 4.2 rebounds, 3.5 assists and 3.8 treys in his last six outings.

Mirotic is a top-50 player when he's healthy and his shot is falling, but he's a risky play tonight.

The Pelicans only play three times this week, though.

             Rondo did not play Saturday due to the wrist issue and was a game-time decision for Tuesday's contest. Ian Clark is going to slide into the starting lineup vs. the Blazers. The fact that Rondo was a GTD for Tuesday implies that he is quite close to returning to the lineup. The Pelicans don't play again until Friday, so Rondo will have two more full days to rest. For now, we'll consider him questionable for that contest.

             Denzel Valentine (knee) is a game-time call, and if he ends up sitting, Nwaba could be forced into heavy minutes tonight. He's been better as a starter this season, owning averages of 11.2 points, 6.3 boards, 1.8 assists, 1.5 steals and 0.8 swats per contest on 57.6% shooting, so he's someone to consider as a deep league streamer tonight.

             Valentine has been posting solid numbers over the last couple of weeks; however, due to the knee issue, it appears he may be limited even if he is cleared to play Tuesday night. It's best to avoid him in DFS and slot someone else in his place if you have that option in standard fantasy formats.

Vonleh's value will take a hit with the move to the second unit, and there should be better options out there on Tuesday's busy eight-game night.

             The good news is the Lakers announced that Ingram participated in games of 3-on-3 on Tuesday. However, it would be somewhat surprising if L.A. cleared him before he was able to make it through a full-contact practice. We should have an update on Ingram's status after Wednesday morning's shootaround.

             Len tweaked his ankle during the fourth quarter of Monday's loss to the Celtics, and given that this is Len's surgically repaired ankle, it wouldn't be surprising to see him spend some time on the shelf for the 19-56 Suns. If he sits, Marquese Chriss and Dragan Bender would log some additional minutes at center, and Alan Williams could see a slight bump in minutes. Check back for another update following Wednesday morning's shootaround.

Nene will get the start with Clint Capela (rest) sitting, and he'll split minutes with Tarik Black at the five spot, but neither of those guys are very attractive in fantasy hoops. Paul owners shouldn't hesitate to get him active for a favorable matchup against the Bulls.

Over his last six games, Mirotic was averaging 9.5 points and 7.2 rebounds, while shooting just 29.2 percent from the floor. He'll try to get back on track Tuesday vs. the Blazers.

             This will be Schroder's second straight game on the sidelines with the ankle issue, suggesting that his absence from Sunday's game (the second of a back-to-back) was more than just a precautionary move. The Hawks have zero incentive to play Schroder at anything less than 100%, so he could miss Friday's game as well and is a cut-candidate if your league ends at Week-24. Isaiah Taylor figures to earn another start, and he's worth a long look in most leagues.

             Mudiay missed Monday's game as well, so Wednesday could be his second straight game on the sidelines. Trey Burke popped off for 42 points as a starter on Monday, and he should continue to see some increased opportunity while Mudiay is on the shelf. Mudiay isn't worth owning in most places.

He should be on waivers in all formats. If Lee is unable to play Wednesday, that will open up more minutes for Frank Ntilikina, Tim Hardaway Jr. and Trey Burke.

             Harkless initially tweaked his left knee back on March 1 and went on to miss three straight games, and it appears that same knee has swelled up on him again. Hopefully, the Blazers are just playing it safe with Harkless on the frontend of a back-to-back set, but with him out tonight, Evan Turner should find his way back into the starting five and he could be a streamer option with what should be an uptempo matchup against the Pelicans.

             It looks like Wednesday will mark Warren's fifth straight game on the sidelines, and considering he's still not practicing, he doesn't appear to be all that close to a return. Josh Jackson will draw another start in his place, and he'll be very busy on the offensive end with Devin Booker (hand) also unlikely. Warren is a cut-candidate for those currently going through the fantasy Finals.

Even once he’s cleared by the doctors for contact, there’s another step after that. As I told him, this is big picture. When you’re ready to go, then we go.""

             This will be Casspi's fifth straight game on the sidelines, and he doesn't appear to be close as there's been no word of him ramping up his activities at practice. Nick Young will continue to log heavy minutes with Klay Thompson (thumb) and Casspi out.

            Draymond Green (flu-like symptoms, throat infection) has been downgraded to doubtful for Tuesday's game against the Pacers.
        
        
             It sounds like Green is dealing with a little bit more than your standard flu, so tonight could be his third straight game on the sidelines. Kevon Looney and Jordan Bell will pick up the slack in his absence, and both those guys are on the radar as potential deep league streamers. The Warriors do still have three more games this week, so we'd advise owners to try and stick with Green, at least until Thursday.

             Valentine has been playing well of late, prior to the knee issue. Over the Bulls last six games, he is averaging 17.5 points, 4.2 rebounds, 3.5 assists and 3.8 treys in 27.4 minutes. If Valentine is ruled out, David Nwaba and Justin Holiday would see an uptick in playing time.RotoGrinders.com Daily Slant: Especially if Valentine is able to play, the Bulls seem like a smart fade for DFS purposes. First, the starters aren't likely to play heavy minutes against the best (albeit shorthanded) team in the west with the Bulls coming in as far and away the biggest underdogs on the board. They also seem to have some interest in dividing playing time to get a look at several potential future pieces, so if you need value the Houston side (Ryan Anderson, Gerald Green) is where you'll want to look.

However, he was rested on Saturday, the second night of a back-to-back. It's probably safe to assume Markkanen will log around 25 minutes on Tuesday. Bobby Portis and Noah Vonleh will see their playing reduced with Lauri back in the mix.

             Simmons has missed three straight games, but was able to go through some 1-on-1 drills at Monday's practice. We should get an update on his status following Tuesday's practice. If Simmons is unable to suit up on Wednesday, Wes Iwundu and Shelvin Mack and Mario Hezonja will see additional playing time.

             Isaac has missed each of Orlando's last two games and was unable to practice on Monday due to lingering pain in his foot. Isaac has also dealt with a serious ankle injury that sidelined him for two-plus months earlier this season. Expect the Magic to be extremely cautious with their prized rookie over the final three weeks of the season. Khem Birch and Mario Hezonja will soak up extra playing time if Isaac is ruled out of Wednesday's contest.

             Morris landed on the foot of Suns guard Troy Daniels after attempting a 3-pointer in the third quarter. He went to the locker room and did not return. Fortunately, X-rays came back negative. He was walking with a slight limp in the locker room but downplayed the seriousness of the injury. ""I could be out a couple days, but nothing long term,"" said Morris. ""So, I’m good."" We'll consider him doubtful for Wednesday's game vs. Utah. If Morris is ruled out, Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown will likely soak up additional minutes.

             Although he apparently won't play Tuesday night, Durant went through some full-contact drills at practice on Monday and is reportedly considered probable to return to game action on Thursday vs. Milwaukee. We will have plenty of updates over the next couple of days, but should he return later this week, Durant will see his usage rate spike, as he'll be playing without Stephen Curry (knee) and Klay Thompson (thumb).

             Cook briefly exited Sunday's game in the second quarter due to knee pain but was back on the floor at the start of the second half. After the game, he said he suffered a ""stinger"" and felt fine. With Stephen Curry (knee) sidelined for the rest of the regular season, Cook is locked into heavy minutes and plenty of scoring opportunities. Over the Warriors last five games, Cook is averaging 20.6 points, 5.0 rebounds, 5.2 assists, 2.8 treys and 1.4 steals in 37.0 minutes. He must be owned in all fantasy leagues.

             Green, who was unable to play Sunday or practice on Monday, was initially listed as questionable for Tuesday's contest, so the fact that he's been upgraded to probable is obviously encouraging. He should be ready to roll, but check back later in the day for confirmation. With Kevin Durant, Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson all sidelined, Green will shoulder more of the offensive load than usual, making him an intriguing DFS target. Kevon Looney and Jordan Bell will see their minutes reduced with Green back in the lineup.

He's been a bit up and down again this season and the Celtics are going to need him to show up in a big way in the playoffs with so many injuries. But unfortunately, his latest two big games came against the Kings and the Suns.

             That makes three solid outings in a row for Ulis, and while we still don't really trust him, the Suns might be ready to wind him up and let him loose the rest of the way. Elfrid Payton did nothing in 15 minutes tonight and the Suns already know what he can do, so Ulis is officially an intriguing pickup if you need a point guard to end your season's fantasy run.

             He appeared to sprain his left ankle early in the fourth quarter and never returned to the game, so he should be considered day-to-day going forward. If Len is out, guys like Alan Williams, Marquese Chriss and Dragan Bender will all see a boost, as Tyson Chandler's not expected to play again this season.

             He's been out all season after knee surgery and looked fine, although a bit slow, in limited run tonight. Alex Len appeared to suffer a sprained left ankle in this one and if he's out, the Suns could give Big Sauce a long look down the stretch. Just keep an eye on him.

             He played 39 minutes and had a nice personal duel going with Jayson Tatum that was fun to watch. Jackson has been one of the best waiver-wire pickups of the season after a slow start and he shouldn't be available to any owner still in the fantasy playoffs.

            Troy Daniels started for Devin Booker again and hit 6-of-16 shots, 6-of-14 3-pointers and finished with 18 points, six rebounds and nothing else in Monday's loss to the Celtics.
        
        
             Daniels has been hot over his last five games, averaging 17.2 points, 4.2 rebounds and 4.2 3-pointers on 43 percent shooting. He's scored at least 18 points in three of his last four, and is one of the leagues more under-appreciated 3-point shooters. Unfortunately, he doesn't do much besides shoot threes, and is helped by the fact that both T.J. Warren and Devin Booker are banged up right now. But if you need a scorer and 3-pointers, he looks really good right now.

             He had a chase-down block on Shane Larkin that was as good as you'll see, and he also looked energized tonight, but as we've come to find out over the last two seasons, he's nearly impossible to trust on a nightly basis. Pick him up and play him at your own risk.

             Gasol has played in two straight games after missing two of his previous three, and struggling in the third game of that set. He outplayed Karl-Anthony Towns tonight and has put up two solid lines in a row, but his next day of rest could come at any time, especially since the Grizzlies have nothing to play for. They don't have another back-to-back set until Apr. 8 & 9, so there's an outside chance he might play on Wednesday, Friday, Sunday, and then on April 4 and April 6 next week. If you own Gasol, watch for news on whether he's going to play or get more rest down the stretch, but there's a chance he'll keep playing.

             Selden also dished out four assists with one rebound, three steals and four triples. He's had some trouble staying healthy this season and that could keep his minutes limited to the 20s, but he was already trending up before this outburst. He's now played 20+ minutes in six straight, averaging 16.3 points, 2.0 rebounds, 2.2 assists, 0.8 steals and 2.5 triples in that span. Give him a look if you need wing help as the Grizzlies have three more games this week.

             Teague bounced back after a couple off games, when he scored a total of just 13 points, but has also scored at least 20 in three of his last five games. The Wolves are now the No. 8 seed in the West and are just 1.5 games up on the No. 9 Nuggets, so it should be all hands on deck going forward, which is good news for Teague's fantasy owners. Hopefully he can keep it going in a tasty revenge game against the Hawks on Wednesday. Teague should be nearly a must-play in all formats for that one.

This comes on the heels of a 20-point game on Saturday with nine assists, four rebounds and a steal, and we still don't know if/when Tyreke Evans (personal) will be back. As long as his wrist doesn't act up or the Grizzlies try to rest him, Harrison should be a solid pickup if you need a PG, especially with three more games this week.

            Nemanja Bjelica missed all five of his shots and failed to score in Monday's 101-93 loss to the Grizzlies, finishing with just four rebounds, one assist and one steal in 22 minutes.
        
        
             Bjelica has gone ice cold, scoring five or fewer points in three of his last five games and averaging just 7.8 points, 5.6 rebounds and 1.2 3-pointers on 40 percent shooting over that stretch. He was rolling before that, but Jimmy Butler remains out after knee surgery, so there's still time for Bjelica to get hot again. But if there's a hot player on waivers you'd rather roll the dice on, it probably makes sense. The Wolves are now just 1.5 games up on the Nuggets for the final playoff spot in the West, so they could really use a resurgence from Bjelica to finish out the regular season. But it's hard to tell if he's going to be capable of pulling it off or not.

             This is the first time he's reached 18 minutes in a game since Dec. 27. That's just sad. Expect more DNPs down the stretch for one of the most injury-prone and well rested players in the NBA.

             Saric also grabbed six rebounds with three assists, three triples and three turnovers. It's going to be interesting to see how the return of Markelle Fultz impacts the rotation once his restrictions are lifted, but that could be a little while. Saric should at least be fine for the remainder of the week with three more games on the schedule.

             With Gary Harris out until March 30 with a knee injury, Barton is picking up the slack, although a steal or block would have been nice. The Nuggets are fighting for their playoff lives, but are still on the outside looking in. And that's good news for their fantasy owners, as they should keep fighting with all they've got until they're officially eliminated.

             Even when he's not scoring Simmons still has a massive impact on the game. He's now up to 32 double-doubles on the season and the only rookie with more in Philly history was Luke Jackson in 1964-65. Markelle Fultz may take the ball out of Simmons hands just a bit, but look for the 76ers to stagger them as much as possible, especially while Fultz has restrictions.

             The Nuggets are now 2.0 games out of the playoffs and are going to have a real tough time getting in, especially since the Spurs and Thunder have played well despite their tough schedules. The good news is this means the Nuggets should keep fighting to make it, so hopefully they keep playing the studs until the end finally comes.

He's now scored 20+ points in 11 out of 13 March games with eight games of at least 10 rebounds. His ankle tweak from Saturday's game obviously didn't bother him and his fantasy owners can look forward to deploying him three more times this week. Kyle Kuzma added 20 points, 11 rebounds, one assist and two triples for the Lakers.

Keep rolling him out there for now, but watch for news in case the Hornets finally throw in the towel at some point.

             He went to the bench with the return of Nicolas Batum, who played 24 minutes, but still came through with a decent fantasy line. The Hornets are very close to being officially eliminated from the playoff hunt, and what they'll do with their lineup once it happens is anyone's guess. Lamb should still have fantasy value either way.

The Lakers were running a lot of offense through him tonight with good results and he became the first Laker with a game of at least 10 points, five assists and five blocks since Pau Gasol in 2010-11. Lopez was an afterthought in fantasy leagues just a couple months ago and now he might be the reason a lot of owners win the title.

             It looked like Batum might be done for the year when he went down with an Achilles injury, but even with the Hornets all but eliminated from the playoffs, he was out there tonight, putting up marginal numbers on a minutes limit and buzzkilling those of you who picked up Jeremy Lamb. Lamb still had a 12-6-6 line and played 28 minutes, so it could have been worse. As for Batum, he has three more games this week, but you have to wonder if he'll play on both Saturday and Sunday.

             Kornet has played meaningful minutes in three straight games and the Knicks could fully set him free at any time, but figuring out exactly when he's going to bust loose won't be easy. If the Knicks throw him into the starting lineup soon, he might be worth grabbing, but even if that happens, he's still going to be a gamble in fantasy. He's benefitted by the absence of Kyle O'Quinn, who's been out with a hip injury lately.

             He only hit 2-of-9 shots, but at least the supporting stats were nice. Johnson has really only had one good stretch this season and that was back in February, so he's safe to leave on the wire. Prior to this game, Johnson had March averages of 6.3 points, 2.9 rebounds and 0.7 triples.

             Drummond only hit 5-of-16 shots, but made up for it by going 5-of-6 from the line. The Lakers even hacked him twice down the stretch, but he calmly hit all four free throws. He's having an incredible bounce-back campaign and coach Stan Van Gundy has challenged him to lead the league in both rebounds and blocks next season.

It's anyone's guess what the Knicks will do with him as the season winds down, but for now, Beasley looks like a strong play for the Knicks two remaining games this week. Just watch the news updates to be sure he's playing every night.

             If you dropped Stephen Curry and picked up Burke, you might have just won a fantasy championship. The NBA's silly season has become notorious for stuff like this, although Burke has actually been playing well for some time, and he had scored between 15 and 19 points in his previous three games. It's anyone's guess what will happen in his two remaining games this week, but if you rolled with him tonight, it probably doesn't matter. Emmanuel Mudiay was out sick tonight, Jarrett Jack might be done for the rest of the season, and Frank Ntilikina might come off the bench the rest of the way. Pick up Burke if he's out there.

            Markelle Fultz made his long-awaited return in Monday's 123-104 win over the Nuggets with 10 points, eight assists, four rebounds and one turnover in 14 minutes on 5-of-13 shots.
        
        
             He had three jumpers blocked and air-balled another, but you could tell that his form was much better and he did hit a pair of jumpers in garbage time. Fultz forced the issue a bit too much during his first stint, but he eventually calmed down and made some really good passes and showed flashes of the player Philly expected when they traded up to take him at No. 1. All in all, this was an encouraging night after several months of the sidelines. The 76ers are going to keep integrating him slowly, but if you need a boost in assists then Fultz is worth a look with three more games on the schedule.

             Jackson played 15, 20 and 22 minutes in his previous three games and was supposed to play 20-25 tonight, but coach Stan Van Gundy didn't want to take him out. He ended up playing 28 minutes and scored seven points in the final seven minutes. That included a dagger pull-up shot with 45 seconds left to seal the win. He finished 9-of-22 from the field with five rebounds, three assists and two triples and is finding his rhythm faster than expected. With three more games this week, fantasy owners should roll the dice on Jackson going forward and hope the minutes continue to trend up.

Booker said he prides himself on playing through injuries and not resting, so unlike other situations around the NBA, this is a legitimate injury and Booker still wants to return as soon as he can. Troy Daniels will get another start and is worth a look if you need to stream some 3-pointers.

He was on a tear before that DNP, scoring 21+ points in three out of his previous five games. He's safe to deploy this week, but the Celtics only play three times.

Sports and Butler himself said he hoped to return prior to the playoffs. He's now beginning Week-5 of that initial 4-6 week timetable, but with no clear return date in sight, he belongs on the waiver wire in all re-draft leagues that don't offer an IR-spot.

             Gallinari was hoping that he'd be able to make it back to the court for Tuesday's game, but the Clippers may want to play it safe with that game being the first of a back-to-back set. He does appear to be on the cusp of a return, so maybe he'll be able to get back out there for Wednesday's game in Phoenix. Wes Johnson will continue to start in his absence with Austin Rivers, Tobias Harris and Lou Williams doing the heavy lifting on offense.

             Mudiay played through the illness on Sunday, but he didn't look quite right and it's too much for him to try and give it a go again on the second night of a back-to-back. With Mudiay unavailable, Trey Burke and Frank Ntilikina will soak up his minutes, with Burke offering more upside.RotoGrinders.com Daily Slant: With Mudiay out, Trey Burke's path to playing time is cleared considerably, with Frank Ntilikina and Jarrett Jack the only players pushing him for time tonight. Jack has not been a member of the rotation recently but did play 7 minutes against CHA back on 3/17. Burke received his first start in exactly three years last night and performed well in the role, so his current DFS asking price is simply too low given the opportunity.

             Thomas will miss his second game in a row on Monday, and ""evaluating treatment options"" sure sounds like surgery is being discussed. Either way, with Thomas looking to sign a contract this summer there's zero incentive for him to fight through the pain and potentially make his hip issue worse, particularly given the team he's currently playing for, so we wouldn't expect him back soon. He wasn't even playing well prior to going down, so he can be cut in most leagues. Lonzo Ball's minutes might regularly be in the 40s to close out the year.

             This will be his sixth missed game of the campaign, but he's been pretty durable for the most part and did play through a few minor tweaks earlier in the season. The Rockets have run away with the No. 1 seed in the West, so more DNPs could be in his future. Hopefully he'll play on Friday vs. the Suns and Sunday vs. the Spurs so this isn't a wasted week for his fantasy owners. Look for Tarik Black and Nene to hold down the fort on Tuesday, but expect to see a lot of small ball as well.

This leaves Harden with just a possible two games this week against the Suns on Friday and the Spurs on Sunday. Chris Paul (hamstring) is probable for Tuesday and will run most of the offense, while Eric Gordon and Gerald Green will both see a significant bump in value. If you need triples, Green is a great streamer for Tuesday.

If he was recently cut in your league, don't hesitate to grab him, as the Hornets have four games this week and Batum's minutes limit should gradually increase with each game. With Batum back in action, Jeremy Lamb will return to the bench and his value will take a hit.

             He continues to get ruled out a full day in advance, and there haven't been any recent reports suggesting he's close. At this point in the fantasy season, there's little incentive to hang on in leagues that don't offer an IR-spot. Kelly Olynyk, Bam Adebayo and James Johnson will continue to pick up the slack in his absence.

             He was able to get up some shots using his right hand during Monday's practice, so he continues to make steps in the right direction, and Anthony Slater of The Atlantic hinted that Thompson could make it back to the court for Sunday's game against the Kings. That's the first game of a back-to-back set, so Thompson may only play in one game this week, making him an unattractive stash for those whose Finals end at Week 24.

             He was seen playing 1-on-1, which is the first time we've seen him go through contact work since going down with the rib injury. Durant will need to go through some 5-on-5 work before he's cleared to return to the court, which is why he probably won't be able to play on Tuesday, but Thursday's game seems like a realistic option. Make sure he's not floating around on your waiver wire, as he'll be extremely busy when he does get out there with Stephen Curry (knee) and Klay Thompson (thumb) out.

             He might still be feeling a bit under the weather, so the team is probably quarantining him to ensure he rests up. We'll have a better idea on Green's status based on his activity level at Tuesday morning's shootaround, but if he's out again, Kevon Looney and Jordan Bell will divvy up his minutes. Stay tuned.

             He'll likely fill a similar role to the one Antonio Blakeney (wrist) had with the Bulls, and he might be able to get meaningful minutes in the rotation while Zach LaVine (knee) and Kris Dunn (toe) are out. Still, this is a wait-and-see situation just about everywhere. As a side note, Kilpatrick's deal will have a team option for the next two seasons, so this is basically a rest-of-season deal for Kilpatrick.

             The Magic are off until Wednesday when they begin a 3-game week, but it's hard to see Simmons playing unless he goes through a full contact practice on Tuesday. The Magic have been using several players more such as Wes Iwundu and Shelvin Mack, but Mario Hezonja is the clear beneficiary and is coming off a 14-point game with eight rebounds, four assists, four steals, two blocks and one triple.

             Apparently you need a lot of rest with a thumb injury. All kidding aside, Noel probably isn't going to be playing in back-to-backs and is rotating games with Salah Mejri at the moment. That means if he doesn't play on Tuesday then he should be back in action on Wednesday vs. the Lakers. When he has been active, Noel has been a beast for owners targeting steals, blocks and rebounds.

             Dirk Nowitzki (knee), Nerlens Noel (rest) and Salah Mejri (rest) are all questionable as well. This is the front end of a back-to-back with a game coming up against the Lakers on Wednesday, so it's possible that these guys play just one game out of the two. This is a mess and it's impossible to predict who will benefit until we know who is active. Avoiding the Mavericks completely might be the best move.

             The Mavericks and Kings are separated by one loss and Dallas owner Mark Cuban has already been fined for publicly admitting to tanking, so it's easy to see what's going on here. This is the front end of a back-to-back with a game vs. the Lakers on Wednesday, so he'll likely end up playing in just one of these. If he's able to go, Dwight Powell (knee) is the big winner if Nowitzki sits because we don't know which game Nerlens Noel will be active for -- he's currently rotating games with Salah Mejri.

             It's unclear how long Barea will be away from the team, but they won't be in a hurry to get him back with nothing to play for. Coach Rick Carlisle said he's excited to see Dennis Smith Jr. ""run the show"" in the final nine games of the season and he'll have an opportunity to play as many minutes as he can handle with Barea out. Yogi Ferrell is also a winner, but he's a low-end asset in standard leagues.

             Are the Bulls worried about Valentine messing up their tank? He's been on a tear in recent weeks, and if we ignore his dud vs. the Knicks he would be averaging 19.4 points, 4.4 rebounds, 3.8 assists, 1.8 steals and 4.6 triples over his last five games. Valentine wasn't able to practice on Monday, so K.C. Johnson of the Chicago Tribune said he may be closer to doubtful. With Kris Dunn (toe) and Zach LaVine (knee) already ruled out, Cameron Payne, David Nwaba and Justin Holiday would be the best plays in Chicago's backcourt if Valentine can't go.

            Kris Dunn (toe) will not play on Tuesday vs. the Rockets.
        
        
             He remains without a timetable to return and may not see the floor again this season. Dunn is making progress and exercised on an elliptical machine on Saturday in his walking boot, but the Bulls would love to be cautious and improve their draft position at the same time. Cameron Payne is locked in as the starting PG for Chicago's 4-game week.

He's averaging just 6.3 points, 2.9 rebounds and 0.7 triples in March and can't be trusted in the fantasy playoffs.

             He was recently upgraded to questionable on the injury report and will be a game-time call tonight. Coach Steve Clifford said Batum will ""try"" to play, but the Hornets will make a final decision on his status after warmups. Batum will start if he's cleared, but may have restrictions. Jeremy Lamb's owners should sit tight for now, and keep in mind that Lamb is still useful in a bench role.

             This a mild surprise and the questionable tag means he could be day-to-day. Batum was listed as doubtful on previous injury reports, so hopefully he's nearing a return. The Hornets don't have a realistic shot of making the playoffs, so we'd expect them to be cautious. If Batum sits again, Jeremy Lamb is the obvious beneficiary and belongs in fantasy lineups.

             Drummond already has one rebounding title in 2015-16 and is on pace to win this year as well. His blocks are also on the rise, as he's averaged 2.1 swats since Jan. 1 compared to 1.2 in the first 35 games of the season. ""I don’t see why not,"" Drummond said when asked if that goal was attainable. Drummond also took a huge step from the free throw line this season, shooting a career-high 60.9%. He's attempting 5.0 per game, so it would still be hard to draft him without punting free throws next season.

             ""One thing we wanted to get on him about is to pick up the defense,"" Hornacek said. ""He’s got the size. He’s got the strength for it, just to put that full effort out. This league is full of great point guards. We have to have guys that can put some pressure on those guys when they come off pick-and- rolls."" Mudiay was recently demoted and defense is just one of the many reasons why. Trey Burke has outplayed him and is the PG fantasy owners want to own in New York.

             Cook said after the game that he suffered a ""stinger"" and feels fine, so we'll leave him off the injury report. Stephen Curry (MCL sprain) is out a minimum of three weeks, which leaves Cook with an outsized role in the Warriors' backcourt. His minutes and usage will drop when Klay Thompson (thumb) and Kevin Durant (ribs) return, of course, but before the game Steve Kerr hinted that might not be imminent. ""I feel good about the other guys coming back in the next week or 10 days,"" he said. In the meantime, fantasy owners should continue to roll with Cook.

             Steve Kerr continues to play the matchups with his center spot, and tonight it was McGee starting ahead of Zaza Pachulia. Fantasy owners relying on McGee for FG% were sorely disappointed. He took a season-high 12 shot attempts, but finished with his worst weighted-FG% performance of the entire season. The obvious culprit was the matchup vs. Rudy Gobert and the Jazz, and he should be better vs. the Pacers on Tuesday.

The Warriors don't have much incentive to play their key guys, considering Steve Kerr said the Warriors are ""going to be the No. 2 seed,"" but there's no reason to own Looney for more than situational defensive stats.

             Shaun Livingston added four points and two rebounds in 18 minutes, but coach Steve Kerr explicitly said that he wants to limit both Iguodala and Livingston over their final nine regular-season games. ""These games are obviously not critical,"" Kerr said. ""We're going to be the No. 2 seed."" The Warriors are extremely short-handed right now, but this basically erases whatever fantasy appeal the veterans had prior to Kerr's statements.

             Bell started Friday's game in place of Draymond Green, but tonight it was Kevon Looney who got the starting nod. The Warriors are relying on depth to compensate for a rash of recent injuries, but Green was only out tonight because of an illness. As long as he's day-to-day, most owners can ignore Bell and Looney. If the Warriors opt to rest Draymond at some point, though, Bell has superior per-minute upside.

The bruised back he sustained on Friday didn't appear to bother him, and his 33 minutes are encouraging, but based on seven previous starts he's a low-upside gamble unless you're looking for steals.

The victory was also the 60th of the season for Houston, as 'The Beard' helped to set a franchise record. Houston called off the dogs in the second half after building a 24-point lead by halftime, and the starters saw limited work in the final 24 minutes. Next up is another potential blowout on Tuesday when the Bulls visit, starting a three-game week.

This is the second time all season that Rubio has been held without any assists, the other being a blowout loss to the Thunder on Dec. 20., and this was basically a fluke -- Utah rested their veterans in the fourth quarter, and Rubio was coming off a nine-assist gem on Friday.

If you're looking for a dependable fantasy replacement, Tucker is probably the best of the lot since he is starting, although Green had a strong game on Sunday off the bench.

             Tucker hit 4-of-9 from the field, all from behind the 3-point line, and he was able to finish with a plus-14 rating. That's fine, but he added just one rebound and no other statistics. He is seeing some added run with Luc Mbah a Moute (knee) sidelined and expected to sit until at least Friday. Still, Tucker's fantasy appeal remains limited to deeper leagues at the moment.

             Exum earned extra run in a lopsided victory tonight, and Utah isn't about to unleash their oft-injured 22-year-old guard -- despite tonight's win, they remain just 1.5 games ahead of the No. 9 seed Nuggets. Jazz PG David Stockton even earned a cameo in garbage time tonight, which sums up the meaninglessness of the final quarter.

             Ariza went 4-of-14 from the field, including 4-of-11 from behind the 3-point line. That includes an impressive 4-of-5 from behind the arc in the first quarter to set the tone early in this one. The veteran also added four rebounds with one turnover. Ariza and the rest of the starters saw some additional rest with the game getting out of hand, as the Rockets set a franchise mark with their 60th victory of the season.

He also added six rebounds and three assists with only one turnover. He, Taurean Prince and Isaiah Taylor were the only three Atlanta players to produce before the game started to get a bit lopsided and it was turned over to the reserves.

He and Isaiah Taylor did a pretty solid job in the backcourt with Dennis Schroder (ankle) on the shelf and Damion Lee struggling in the starting five. However, he is only worth a look in the very deepest of fantasy leagues if you need help in the 3-point category.

             Lee hit 2-of-9 from the field, including 0-of-5 from behind the 3-point line. He was likely having a hard time concentrating at the offensive end because he started the game with the priority assignment of defending James Harden. That's enough to break anyone's focus. Lee remains useful only in the deepest of fantasy formats heading into the new week.

             Taylor, who played four games with the Rockets last season, was getting the start with Dennis Schroder (ankle) on the shelf. He was on fire, hitting 10-of-17 from the field, including 3-of-6 from behind the 3-point line. He also chipped in with three assists, a rebound and a steal overh is 32 minutes. If Schroder continues to miss time Taylor isn't a bad streaming option and low-cost DFS play.

            Carmelo Anthony finished with just six points across 29 minutes in Sunday's home loss against the Trail Blazers.
        
        
             Anthony just hasn't looked comfortable in Oklahoma City, especially lately. He was just 3-of-13 from the field, including 0-of-5 from behind the 3-point line. Melo is averaging just 9.8 points and 5.0 rebounds over his past five outings, hitting just 34.5 percent (19-of-55) from the field. Head coach Billy Donovan said he sticks with Melo because of his communication. ""He's probably one of our best communicators on the floor. He's a great communicator on defense,"" Donovan said.

            Evan Turner (low back soreness) was able to play 14 minutes in Sunday's game at Oklahoma City, finishing with two points.
        
        
             Turner hit just 1-of-4 from the field, including 0-of-1 from behind the 3-point line, and he added one rebound with two turnovers. It was an ugly game for E.T., and perhaps his sore lower back to blame. At least his back held up enough during a fracas, as Turner came to the aid of Terrance Ferguson before exchanging words with Russell Westbrook. He received a technical foul for his troubles, but no ejection. Turner is a question mark for fantasy owners in deeper leagues heading into the upcoming week, but since the Blazers have four games on tap he should be deployed as usual.

            Ed Davis (right foot strain) was able to play 18 minutes off the bench Sunday in Oklahoma City.
        
        
             Davis ended up with just two points, two rebounds, an assist and three turnovers with four personal fouls and a minus-14 rating, so it was an ugly performance. He was also involved in an altercation, taking exception to a hard foul from Terrance Ferguson. A shoving match resulted in a technical foul, but no ejection. Davis usually does better when Jusuf Nurkic is sidelined or in four trouble, but neither of those things were the case. He is only worth using in deeper leagues heading into the four-game work week.

             Fox made 5-of-10 field goals but didn't get the free-throw line or record a single rebound, steal or block. He's had some clutch moments this month, offering glimpses of his fantasy potential, but re-draft owners shouldn't be chasing upside at this point -- Fox has one 3-pointer in his past six games, one multi-steal game since March 4th, and he's a poor FT shooter.

             Jackson came in averaging an unrealistic 17.5 points on combined 14-of-17 shooting (82.4% shooting) in his previous two games. The rookie has been terrific for FG% in March, but low-volume games expose his lack of fantasy versatility -- so far this month he's averaged just 3.4 rebounds, 1.3 assists, 0.2 steals and 0.2 blocks. There are more well-rounded options available on the wire in most leagues.

             Garrett Temple (ankle) and Zach Randolph (illness) were both out tonight, but Sacramento still leaned on a pair of veterans with VC and Kosta Koufos (eight points, nine boards) both logging 20+ minutes off the bench. Carter has played in three consecutive games and could be part of the rotation rest-of-season, even if he's rested during a back-to-back set on Mar. 31-Apr. 1. He's not helping fantasy owners, but it's still nice to see Carter earning minutes at age 41.

             Napier missed Friday's game due to his nagging left big toe injury. He ended up with two points, four rebounds and two assists across 12 minutes in this one. With the Portland backcourt at full strength, he is only worth using in deeper leagues heading into the upcoming four-game work week.

             Monroe came in with double-digit points in five straight games, his longest streak of the season. His scoring will be more important than ever with Kyrie Irving (knee) done for the regular season, so we're not reading much into tonight's dud vs. the Kings -- Kosta Koufos actually deserves some credit for checking Monroe tonight. He should fare much better vs. Phoenix on Monday.

             Brown missed six games with his concussion and his return was terrific news for the Celtics, who are limping toward the No. 2 seed despite missing Kyrie Irving (knee), Marcus Smart (thumb) and Daniel Theis (knee). They were also without Marcus Morris (ankle) tonight, with Brown taking his spot in the starting lineup, a move that should stick even when Morris is healthy. He was limited in part by foul trouble tonight and owners can expect better going forward -- if he's on your wire, don't hesitate to grab him.

However, the team does face a back-to-back situation Tuesday in New Orleans and Wednesday in Memphis, so there could be concern there about his availability if he has any flare ups.

             Lillard is about to be a father, so he might need to leave the team at any moment. Perhaps his mind was elsewhere, as he was just 6-of-19 from the field, including 1-of-7 from behind the arc, but can you blame him? He was able to concentrate and go 11-of-11 from the charity stripe while adding seven rebounds, five assists and three steals to make his fantasy owners happy. DFS players will want to keep a close eye on the news this week, as he could miss time. The team has a back-to-back situation Tuesday in New Orleans and Wednesday in Memphis, and those in standard play hope the Lillard brood can at least hold off on arriving until after that.

            Semi Ojeleye came off Boston's bench for nine points, two rebounds and a pair of 3-pointers in 28 minutes on Sunday.
        
        
             Boston has a 20-8 record vs. teams from the Western Conference this season, which is the best record for any Eastern team. Their success is due in part to unheralded guys like Ojeleye, who has now played 23+ minutes in five of Boston's past six games. The 23-year-old rookie has stepped up since Daniel Theis (knee) went down, but this is his highest-scoring game since Nov. 1. Suffice to say, he's not a fantasy asset.

             Rozier went 8-of-12 from deep while committing just one turnover in 36 minutes of action, helping Boston win on the road in Sacramento. He's been an elite waiver-wire pickup since injuries knocked out Marcus Smart (thumb) and Kyrie Irving (knee), and is the first player in NBA history to record the numbers he had tonight. He also fell one shy of the Celtics' single-game record for 3-pointers, and when asked if he knew he was that close, he replied, ""If I knew that, I would’ve shot five more."" Congratulations if you're the savvy owner who plucked him off the wire.

            The Wizards lost at home to the Knicks on Sunday, despite Tomas Satoransky contributing nine points, 10 assists, four rebounds, three steals, one block and one 3-pointer.
        
        
             Satoransky is a steady source of assists and steals, yet this is just the third time all season he's dropped double-digit dimes -- and the second time all season he's had at least three steals. John Wall (knee surgery) recently practiced without limitations and could conceivably return as soon as Tuesday's home game vs. San Antonio, but Satoransky did say after tonight's game that the Wizards ""still have two more games without [Wall]."" That's not the same as an injury update, but it still gives Satoransky's owners hope for more games with unfettered playing time.

             If there was any doubt about the Wizards missing John Wall, which there shouldn't have been, this settles it. Beal made five shots overall, including a 1-of-6 mark from downtown, but fantasy owners can't complain since he'd made at least 50% of his shots in five straight games prior to tonight. Expect him to come out firing vs. the visiting Spurs on Tuesday.

             Maybe the 31-year-old veteran had revenge on his mind vs. his former Knicks team? Regardless, he has stepped up in the absence of John Wall (knee), usurping Tim Frazier's minutes as a reliable second-unit guard for the month of March. It sounds like Wall will return soon, and of course neither Sessions nor Frazier should be owned regardless of your league's depth.

             Porter wasn't very efficient with 5-of-13 field goals and an atypical 2-of-4 mark at the free-throw line, but the supporting stats more than make up the difference. He was spotted stretching out his ""right side"" early in the second quarter tonight, but didn't seem bothered afterward -- he played the final 5:52 of a close game, so presumably it was just routine maintenance. We'll let you know if there's more to the story.

             DeRozan struggled with his shot, hitting just 3-of-12 from the field, including 0-of-1 from behind the 3-point line. It appears that rest hasn't done him very good, as he was given off on Tuesday. Since returning, he is 0-of-8 in three games from behind the 3-point line. The rest appears to have interrupted his rhythm. He'll get more rest in the upcoming week, as Toronto has just two games on the schedule. He'll likely see more rest down the stretch, but at least there are no more back-to-back sets until April 3-4 and April 8-9.

             New York is embracing the youth movement and they started Ntilikina alongside Trey Burke tonight -- expect that to continue for at least a few more games. The Knicks' 19-year-old rookie is shooting just 35.8% from the field this season, of course, with a poor assist-to-turnover ratio, so more minutes don't necessarily mean more fantasy value -- especially since he'll be facing starting-caliber PGs on a nightly basis. He has nice upside for steals in particular, but tread carefully in roto leagues.

             Lee accepted his demotion with grace, and said he even anticipated being replaced by one of the Knicks' younger guards. This was the veteran's third game as a reserve all season and there's no reason to think the lineup change will revive his fantasy appeal -- his minutes are down to 22.3 per game in March, after averaging 32.6 per game before the break. We'd like to see him reproduce this line before burning a transaction for him.

That leaves Kornet with a clear-cut role behind Enes Kanter (10 points, 11 boards in 27 minutes), and he has enough daylight in the rotation to be worth a speculative add in deeper leagues.

             Lowry hit 4-of-9 from the field, including 3-of-7 from behind the 3-point line, and he added eight assist with six rebounds and a steal. But he also turned it over four times, too. This point total also snapped a season-high four-game streak with 20 or more points. Still, he is averaging 4.8 3-pointers over his past six outings and he continues to put up big fantasy numbers. Unfortunately for fantasy owners, Lowry and the Raptors have a two-game week starting on Tuesday against the Nuggets.

             The defensive stats were nice since his offense left a lot to be desired. The Austrian big ended up hitting just 2-of-6 from the field to finish with five points, including an ugly 1-of-4 performance at the free-throw line. Poeltl is a nice source of boards in deeper leagues, and he could see increased playing time down the stretch if the Raptors elect to rest Jonas Valanciunas and/or Serge Ibaka to preserve them for what they hope is a long playoff run.

He was seeing some extra run with Jonas Valanciunas in a spot of foul trouble working down low against DeAndre Jordan. Siakam has some upside, but at this point he is only worth a roster spot in the deepest of leagues.

             Valanciunas hit 7-of-11 from the field, including 1-of-1 from behind the 3-point line, but foul trouble limited his playing time. He did well offensively against DeAndre Jordan, but working on him defensively frequently ended with the referee blowing his whistle. He'll look to keep up the good play in Tuesday's game against Milwaukee to kick off a four-game week.

             Miles missed the past two games due to a battle with gastroenteritis, but he looked fine in this one. He was able to drop in three 3-pointers, although his minus-14 rating wasn't particularly strong. He has hit at least one 3-pointer in 41 of his past 42 outings, and triples are the category he helps his fantasy owners the most.

             Williams started the game just 1-of-8 from the field, but he ended up finishing strong with 9-of-16. It's nice that he doesn't let his struggles linger and he has no conscience. Williams was also 1-of-4 from behind the arc while going 5-of-5 from the charity stripe while adding seven assists with two rebounds, an assist and a blocked shot. He continues to be locked into major role off the bench as the Clips scratch and claw for a final postseason spot in the Western Conference.

             Domantas Sabonis tweaked his left ankle during pre-game warmups, which left Trevor Booker (six points, six boards) with a healthy 22-minute role off the bench, but Turner will need to do the heavy lifting for Indiana to secure home-court advantage in the first round of the playoffs. Tonight's lousy shooting is a result of the fact that he took just one shot inside of 10 feet -- his ability to spread the court is commendable, but hopefully he'll get more looks near the rim vs. Golden State on Tuesday.

Joseph made 4-of-7 shots off the bench and the only downside was the lack of 3-pointers, steals or blocks. The Pacers continue to roll with him in three-guard lineups, which is terrific news for his deep-league owners.

             Young committed just one turnover in 36 minutes of action, and his efforts helped Indiana clinch a playoff berth -- incidentally, the victory also means the Sixers have clinched a spot in the playoffs. Thad's superior defensive stats are the key to his mid-round fantasy appeal, and he's also been a terrific source of rebounds (8.3) and FGs (53.7%) over the past few weeks.

He leads all qualified players in 3-point percentage, at a sterling 45.3%, and has quickly picked up where he left off before his arthroscopic left knee surgery. He's a lock in any lineup despite the Pacers' mediocre three-game schedule next week.

You never know and that’s the beauty of this."" Fantasy owners may not feel the same, but Dragic has been cruising with mid-round value and should stay there thanks to Miami's playoff race.

            Tyler Johnson bounced back on Sunday with 19 points, five 3-pointers, four assists, three rebounds and zero turnovers in 29 minutes.
        
        
             Johnson opened the game 4-of-4 from downtown within the first seven minutes, and he finished 7-of-10 from the field overall. He can often be hit-or-miss for fantasy owners, but that's all part of Miami's balanced attack. ""Aside from certain guys, literally anybody can end up taking 15, 16 shots and burying like 10 of them,"" Johnson said before the game. Despite some inconsistency, he's doing enough to be deployed in all but the shallowest leagues.

             It was Wade's second game back from a hamstring injury and he looked good, hitting 6-of-13 shots with just one turnover. He played extensively in the fourth quarter and didn't leave the court during overtime, which bodes well for his role going forward. Miami only has one back-to-back set remaining (April 3-4), so that cuts down the likelihood of DNP-CDs, but Wade is still just a low-end fantasy option.

             Miami was being coached by Dan Craig because Erik Spoelstra was with his expectant wife on Sunday, but there's no reason to suspect that was the cause of Winslow's dud -- he played 19 minutes vs. the Lakers last Friday, for instance, before rallying with three solid games. Now that Dwyane Wade is back in the rotation, though, most owners should seek more reliable value on the wire.

             The Warriors are a mash unit right now, so Kerr wants to limit the minutes of key veterans down the stretch to get everyone as ready as possible for what they obviously hope is a long championship run. He'll likely see 20-25 minutes at the most, and there is very little risk of his joining the starting five.

             While the veteran is available, head coach Steve Kerr said he wants to limit the minutes of Livingston for the final regular season games as he preserves the veteran for the playoffs. He has been on the injury report for basically the entire season. Livingston isn't expected to play more than 18-24 minutes even with the team banged up, including Steph Curry (knee) out for the remainder of the regular season and into the first round of the playoffs.

             ""There's no way he's playing in the first round,"" head coach Steve Kerr said on Sunday. Fantasy owners have already accepted the bad news that Curry is done for the rest of the regular season due to the Grade 2 MCL sprain he suffered in his left knee. Fantasy owners of Quinn Cook aren't shedding any tears, though. He is expected to do some heavy lifting down the stretch, and now apparently into the Western Conference Quarterfinals, with Curry on the shelf.

             Antetokounmpo’s ankle was a complete non-issue in this one, as he had nice elevation on his jumper and didn’t hesitate to attack the rack, so he should be just fine moving forward. As an added bonus, The Greek Freak also drilled three triples, putting his season total at 39. However, he’s still connecting on just 29.5% of his long-range bombs, so we wouldn’t anticipate that suddenly developing into to a trend over the final few weeks of the fantasy season.

             Parker flopped through 30 minutes as a starter on Friday, but he really wasn't much better running with the reserves today. He's had a handful of solid games, but inconsistency has been an issue, so he's more of a low-end source of points in deep leagues.

             Middleton did a terrific job of disrupting the passing lanes for San Antonio, played lockdown defense on Dejounte Murray on the Spurs final possession, and there really wasn’t much San Antonio could do to try and stop him on offense. The Bucks did an excellent job of creating points off turnovers, outscoring the Spurs 25-2 on the break, and as an added bonus for 9-cat owners, Middleton didn’t have a single turnover.

             Bledsoe also added one 3-pointer, three rebounds, five assists, one steal and three turnovers in the 32 minutes he was out there, and he was a huge part of the win, getting easy shots at the rim and draining tightly contested jumpers. He was particularly impressive in the third, scoring 11 of his 23 points on 4-of-5 shooting (2-of-2 from the stripe) while operating with a 33.1 usage rate.

             Gasol had a slow start to the game, recording just two points through the first half of action, but he caught fire during the third quarter, scoring 13 of his 22 points while rocking a 54.1 usage rate. Gasol had a clutch putback bucket with 30 seconds left to bring the Spurs within three, but they biffed their final possession with Dejounte Murray settling for a tightly contested 3-pointer, and ended up losing the game.

             Aldridge had the hot hand early for San Antonio, netting 16 points through the first half of action, and his hot play continued into the second half with the Bucks not really having any answers for him. He also went 10-of-12 from the charity stripe to give him a sterling 64.7 true shooting percentage, and over the past two games, LMA has been rocking a 37.8 usage rate.

             Aside from LaMarcus Aldridge and Pau Gasol, most of the Spurs struggled to be effective in this one, and Patty Mills didn't do much to help the cause going 1-of-6 from the field on his way to four points, one 3-pointer, two assists and one turnover. Rudy Gay wasn't very good either, finishing with 10 points, seven boards and one steal across 18 minutes, and with so many players on the Spurs side struggling, their six-game win streak came to an end.

He’s not worth the headache in most settings.

             To be clear, Wall will not play Sunday against the Knicks, but he was able to get in a full practice on Saturday, to which he responded well, and he'll get in another light workout tonight. Scott Brooks said he wanted Wall to get in multiple full practices before returning to the court, so if all goes well, there's a chance Wall could make it back to the court for Tuesday's game against the Spurs or Thursday's game in Detroit. He's worth stashing if you feel confident in your upcoming matchup.

The Celtics won't host a shootaround tomorrow, so Morris will likely be a game-time call.

             This likely means that Emmanuel Mudiay and Courtney Lee will be running with the second unit tonight. Ntilikina started the second half on Friday and finished with 13 points, five boards, three dimes, one steal and two triples, so he'll be someone to consider as a streamer.

With Marcus Morris (ankle) and Kyrie Irving (knee) unavailable, there will be a large hole to fill on the offensive end, so Brown should see a lot of shots falling his way today. Feel free to get him active.

             Russell had a tough time staying on the court, and George Hill did a really nice job of making life difficult for him on the offensive end of the floor. Caris LeVert wasn’t much better with the second unit, scoring eight points on 3-of-9 shooting to go with four boards, seven dimes and a turnover, but both these guys should be better on Wednesday with a much more favorable matchup against Orlando.

             Dinwiddie finally had a good game with D’Angelo Russell in foul trouble, but it’s been a struggle for him more often than not since being demoted to the second unit. Over the past six games, Dinwiddie has offered up meager averages of 11.5 points, 3.8 dimes, 1.3 triples and 1.5 turnovers per game on 45.7% shooting. Maybe he’ll be able to get things back on track after today’s decent game, but we’re not optimistic.

             Crabbe just never really got going in this one, missing four of his first five shots and also getting himself into some early foul trouble. It wasn’t necessarily the Cavs’ defense that slowed him down, as he missed quite a few wide-open looks, but Crabbe’s maddening inconsistency is no secret in fantasy hoops. Over the past four games he’s scored five, 18, nine and 22 points respectively.

             Harris got off to an extremely hot start, racking up 18 points on 7-of-8 shooting through a quick, 10-minute stretch during the second quarter, and he essentially single-handedly kept Brooklyn in the game. He set a new career-high in scoring and also became just the fourth Brooklyn player to score at least 30 points this season, but he’s not going to be hitting 78.6% of his shots on most nights, and he really can’t be viewed as anything more than a 3-point specialist in deep leagues.

             Ingram continues to take steps in the right direction, but it's unlikely he'll be able to get out there until he's going through 5-on-5 work. After Monday's game, Ingram will have three more opportunities to get out there, but he'll likely have a minutes limit upon his return, thus limiting his stash appeal. He's not really worth dealing with if your fantasy playoffs end at Week-24.

            Marcus Morris (right ankle sprain) has been ruled out for Sunday's game against the Kings.
        
        
             Morris sprained his ankle on Friday, but was able to play through it, so maybe his absence from tonight's game against the 24-49 Kings is more precautionary than anything else with it being the first game of a back-to-back set. Jaylen Brown (concussion) is probable to play, so he'll be soaking up most of Morris' minutes and should be operating with a hefty usage rate with Kyrie Irving (knee) out.

             Green was previously listed as probable to play after missing Friday's game with a pelvic contusion, but apparently, he's fallen ill and will miss today's game. That should grant Jordan Bell another opportunity to start with Kevon Looney also seeing some extended minutes. The Warriors take on the Pacers on Tuesday, and for now, we'll be considering Green questionable for that one.

In addition to Parker losing value, Shabazz Muhammad loses most of his streaming appeal.

He only missed one game, so he may not have restrictions. With Giannis back, Jabari Parker will head back to the bench and will be just a low-end fantasy asset.

Wallace may be Los Angeles' best option at shooting guard right now, so he's firmly on the radar as a pickup in deeper formats. In his last two games with the Clippers on Feb. 23 and Feb. 27, Wallace averaged 15.5 points, 5.0 rebounds and 4.5 assists.

            Kyrie Irving's minimally-invasive procedure on his knee ""revealed that the fractured patella Irving suffered in 2015 has completely healed and his knee is structurally sound overall"" according to Matt Dollinger of SI.com.
        
        
             This is great news and it sounds like this was a relatively minor procedure. The Celtics gave him a 3-6 week timetable, but his status for the first-round of the playoffs is up in the air. Terry Rozier will hold down the fort in the meantime.

""He knows he’s got a coaching staff and a team that will welcome him in when he says go."" His shot has been looking better in pre-game warmups, and while there have been some rumors that he's close to a return, we haven't heard anything about a potential return date.

             Green stepped up admirably for the Cavaliers when they were banged up, but now Kevin Love, Tristan Thompson and Larry Nance are all healthy. If you were relying on Green, it's probably time to find a replacement on the wire. Green should be considered questionable for Tuesday's game vs. the Heat.

             This is great news for the Celtics after six straight games on the shelf. Brown will probably have some restrictions until he gets his conditioning back up, so he will be tough to trust right away. If Brown is able to go, that could impact quite a few players such as Shane Larkin, Abdel Nader and Semi Ojeleye. Marcus Morris' ceiling also won't be quite as high.

             Morris rolled his ankle on Friday vs. Portland, but he was able to remain in the game after getting it re-taped. We'll hopefully have an update after their morning shootaround, but Morris is probably closer to probable unless his ankle swelled up on him. Morris has scored 21+ points in three out of his last five games and has stepped up in a big way for the injury-depleted Celtics. If he can't go, the good news is that Boston is expected to get Jaylen Brown (concussion) back today.

             Ferrell was a very solid 7-of-10 from the field, including 1-of-4 from behind the 3-point line, and he helped out with two rebounds, two assists, two steals, a blocked shot and just one turnover. He is averaging 14.2 points over his past six outings and will look to tie a season high with seven straight double-digit point totals on Tuesday when the team travels to Sacramento.

             Noel was a very efficient 5-of-8 from the field and he also chipped in with four steals, two assists and a blocked shot. It appears he and Salah Mejri are going to alternate between meaningful playing time and DNP-CDs, although it will be interesting to see if Noel might have bought himself more playing time Tuesday in Sacramento with his solid effort.

He also added six assists and five rebounds while committing just two turnovers. It was a decent showing and it appears safe to plug him back into the active fantasy lineup if you normally depend upon him, especially since the team has a four-game week upcoming.

He might continue to make starts down the stretch, and he has a four-game week coming up, but he is best left to the waiver wire at this point.

Dallas has a four-game schedule in the upcoming week, but a back-to-back situation Tuesday in Sacramento and Wednesday in L.A. against the Lakers.

            Kemba Walker finished Saturday's 102-98 win in Dallas with 24 points, three steals, two rebounds and two assists while dropping in four 3-pointers.
        
        
             Walker leads the NBA in 3-pointers since the All-Star break with 56 triples. It helps that he has 14 treys over the past two outings, and he has 13 games with two or more 3-pointers across his past 17 contests since the break. Head coach Steve Clifford is showing no signs of resting Walker down the stretch even with Charlotte's playoff chances on serious life support.

             Howard was back from an automatic one-game suspension after picking up his 16th technical foul of the season on Wednesday. He was making up for lost time, abusing the overmatched men in the middle in Big D. Howard is averaging a ridiculous 24.0 points and 26.5 rebounds over the past two outings. He has a four-game week for his fantasy owners, starting Monday against the Knicks, so expect big things.

             Monk hit 4-of-12 from the field, including 3-of-5 from behind the 3-point line, while adding two steals, an assist and a rebound with just one turnover and a respectable plus-7 rating. He didn't show any ill effects of the hand injury which forced him out of Thursday's game. Despite the double-digit point total, he is still a risky fantasy play even in deeper leagues.

             Gasol hit 6-of-16 from the floor, but he was an ugly 0-of-4 from behind the 3-point line. He made up for his long-distance woes by hitting 6-of-7 from the free-throw line, while grabbing five rebounds, three assists and two steals. Gasol is a veteran, and a bit more risky from a fantasy perspective in Memphis. He is likely to see plenty of rest down the stretch, which is good news for guys like Deyonta Davis, Jarell Martin and JaMychal Green.

             Harrison hit 7-of-15 from the field, including 1-of-5 from behind the 3-point line, while adding 5-of-6 from the free-throw line. He also dished out nine assists with four rebounds and a steal while turning it over twice. Harrison didn't show any ill effects of his wrist injury and he appears to be fine for fantasy owners to use in the upcoming four-game week.

             Martin also chipped in with four blocked shots, two assists and a steal while hitting 5-of-13 from the field. It was his first double-double since March 3 in Orlando, and first double-double in front of the home folks since Nov. 28, 2016. He appears to be one of the core players in Memphis down the stretch, so he is useful in most fantasy formats.

             Win or lose, and let's face it - mostly lose - Green has been a breath of fresh air in Grind City. He hit 7-of-10 from the field, including 3-of-3 from behind the 3-point line. Green has rolled up seven or more rebounds in eight consecutive outings, going for 10.5 rebounds per game during the impressive stretch. He has emerged as a useful fantasy option in all standard leagues.

He also chipped in with two steals, two rebounds and an assist while he did not commit a turnover. Wear has been signed for the remainder of the season and he could be part of the rotation as long as Brandon Ingram (groin) is on the shelf. Still, his fantasy appeal is rather minimal.

             Capela tied a career high with the six blocked shots and three steals. It's the first time a Rockets player managed at least six blocks and three steals in a single game since Hakeem Olajuwon did it on the road against Utah back on Nov. 24, 1993. Houston has posted a 23-2 record when Capela scores more than 15 points, and they're a perfect 11-0 when he goes for 20-plus points.

            DeAndre Liggins was scoreless across 26 minutes in a start Saturday in Houston.
        
        
             Liggins was a dismal 0-of-4 from the field, including 0-of-2 from the perimeter, and he ended up with four rebounds, two assists, a blocked shot and a turnover with  a minus-10 rating. He failed miserably in his opportunity with Rajon Rondo (wrist) on the mend. The Pelicans have three games on tap in the upcoming week and even if Liggins were to start all three, his fantasy appeal is still very minimal.

            Julius Randle rolled his left ankle in Saturday's road win against the Grizzlies, but the good news is that he did not need X-rays after the game.
        
        
             The fact he did not need any X-rays or additional tests after the game is good news. He'll have until Monday in Detroit to rest before he is needed again. The Lakers have four games on tap for the upcoming week so even if he might need to rest for one game, he is still a must-start fantasy option for the upcoming week. If he were to sit Ivica Zubac might see a lot more run.

             It was an ugly night for the point guard, as he was also a dismal 5-of-17 from the field in addition to the six turnovers. He salvaged the fantasy stat line somewhat with four rebounds, four assists and two steals, but he killed everyone in field-goal percentage and turnovers. He'll look for a bounce-back game Tuesday against the visiting Trail Blazers.

             The Rockets got a ton out of Ryno on Saturday with 16 points, four rebounds, one assist, one steal, one block and four 3-pointers in 34 minutes. That's a massive bump from his 20 minutes on Thursday and from his 14.3 minutes per game this month. Nene will likely pick up some minutes with Anderson out.

             Translation: CP3 is doubtful. He has missed the last two games because of his hammy strain, which is not considered serious. There are way too many injuries to superstar point guards right now and that is probably a factor here.

             Moore was one of four New Orleans starters with a minus-10 rating or worse, and things got a little testy, too. He and Eric Gordon got into a bit of a dust-up, earning technicals, as each player took exception to the physical play of each other. Perhaps it was Moore taking out some frustrations after his alma mater Purdue was ousted from the NCAA Tournament on Friday night.

He also added eight rebounds, four blocked shots, two steals and an assist with just one turnover. It was a subpar night by his standards, although the blocked shots total was nice. However, he was really the only guy in a Pels jersey who showed up.

             Hello, Mr. Gordon. Those dimes were a career high and he did a little bit of everything on offense, including getting to the basket. He's been a stat-stuffer since his return to the lineup, averaging 18.3 points, 9.3 boards, 4.3 dimes, 2.0 steals, 1.0 blocks and 2.0 treys in those three. If you stashed him while he was hurt, you have to be happy about it.

In this age of tanking, fantasy owners of Magic veterans have to be enjoying how the team is approaching the finish to their season. The talk of coach Frank Vogel possibly losing his job could also be great news for Vucevic.

             Finally. Hezonja has been a major letdown since the Aaron Gordon concussion, but maybe this line gets him going. Jonathon Simmons is out for about a week, so Hezonja should have a chance to produce with three games. He's risky, but he has upside as you can see with this line. Although, it was against the Suns.

            Luke Kennard scored 13 points with three rebounds, six assists, one steal and one 3-pointer in 27 minutes against the Bulls on Saturday.
        
        
             He did start the second half because of a Stanley Johnson (glute) injury. Kennard is starting to show some consistency lately with double-digit points in each of his last five, averaging 13.0 points, 3.4 boards, 2.6 assists, 1.0 steals and 1.6 treys. That could be sustainable, so he's worth a look if you like scoring.

             He got hot with 12 attempts from deep, but this wasn't all about garbage time either. Basically, the bottom line is starting players against the Bulls in DFS is usually a good move.

             His minutes were still pretty high even though Justin Holiday was starting. With Antonio Blakeney (wrist) and Zach LaVine (knee) out, Nwaba could flirt with 30 minutes most nights.

             His ankle tweak from Friday was a non-issue in this game and he was out there for garbage time. Payne has his role solidified with Kris Dunn (toe) still nowhere near a return, so fire up Cameron Payne in just about all leagues for a four-game week. Wait, what? Yeah, it's been a wild season when Cam Payne is a strong start.

             It was just a spot start for Vonleh with Lauri Markkanen (rest) out for this one. Vonleh should be back on the bench for the next game, so it'll be tough to use him even in a four-game week.

             They did it. The 76ers have clinched their first winning season over an 82-game campaign since 2004-05. In this win, Embiid owned Karl-Anthony Towns all night on both ends of the court and made an impact on help D. The 76ers almost were able to keep Embiid's minutes down for the second game in a row, but coach Brett Brown had to go back to his starters with three minutes left despite having a 28-point lead. Embiid is probably going to get a game off at some point, but the 76ers have a great schedule this week with four games and no back-to-back sets. He should be huge in your matchup.

             The 76ers smashed the Wolves in the third 39-19 for their largest margin of victory in a quarter all season. They are also on a six-game winning streak to make it two six-plus winning streaks on the year. That hasn't happened since 2002-03 and they're looking like a great bet to be a top four seed. These aren't your older sibling's 76ers and The Homie Dario doesn't get enough credit.

             Make it 10 trip-dubs for Simmons for the second most ever for a rookie. Everyone gets caught up in the Rookie of the Year, but it's so fun to watch both Simmons and Donovan Mitchell. They're so different and Simmons continues to electrify with his passing with a ridiculous bounce pass in transition today (video in link below). He'll be a top-30 pick next year and could go top 20 if you're looking for counting stats. He also gets four games next week, so that's huge for his fortunate owners.

            James Harden is starting on Saturday against the Pelicans.
        
        
             He did have a minor ankle tweak on Thursday night, but the MVP is a go for this game. He'll be a good bet for a rest night on Sunday, though.

            Giannis Antetokounmpo (ankle) will be a game-time call against the Spurs.
        
        
             An MRI on Saturday only showed minor swelling, so Giannis may only need to miss one game after an ankle roll on Wednesday. If he can't go, Shabazz Muhammad would be getting most of the minutes while Jabari Parker would likely start.

             With Nikola Mirotic and Rajon Rondo out, coach Alvin Gentry gets a little wild with the starters today. Miller should get plenty of chances to hoist treys while Ian Clark should see more minutes than Liggins.

             The Hornets keep calling him doubtful for weeks now, so take a guess what his status will be for Monday against the Knicks. Willy Hernangomez should get the backup center minutes.

             He is going to be re-evaluated in three weeks, so he's officially out for the regular season. Typically, a Grade 2 sprain requires six weeks out of the lineup, which means Curry is likely out for the first round of the postseason. This is very similar to the MCL sprain Kevin Durant suffered in March when Zaza Pachulia fell into him, so hopefully he won't miss more than six weeks. Quinn Cook has to make the roster now, which means someone on the Warriors is going to be cut and it's probably Omri Casspi.

            Kyrie Irving (knee) underwent a minimally-invasive procedure on Saturday to remove a tension wire in his left knee.
        
        
             He is expected to return to basketball activities in 3-6 weeks. This likely means Irving could be back for the first round of the playoffs as he recovers from this lingering knee injury, but worst case he's out for the first two rounds. General manager Danny Ainge has mentioned Irving's knee issue could cut his season short going forward, so that'll be something to watch. Terry Rozier has the keys to the offense for the rest of the regular season.

             It's an excused absence for Evans as he deals with a family illness.  Expect several games off for Evans the rest of the way and hopefully his family is OK.

             We're still waiting for the MRI results, which should be released around 5:00 EDT. There's a good chance the Warriors just shut him down regardless, so Curry is a drop candidate in fantasy leagues. Quinn Cook should be owned in all leagues.

             This was expected, as Warren has missed each of the Suns' previous two contests and was considered highly unlikely to suit up Saturday vs. Cleveland. Devin Booker is listed as doubtful for this game, so the Suns will likely be thin on the wing once again. Josh Jackson and Troy Daniels have been the primary beneficiaries.

            Coach Scott Brooks said that John Wall (knee) will not play Sunday vs. the Knicks, but that Wall was able to practice fully, without restrictions, on Saturday.
        
        
             Brooks told reporters that the team is not going to put a timetable on Wall's return and that no finite number of practices will determine his readiness. Brooks said that the decision would be made by all parties - coaches, doctors, and Wall himself. Next week marks eight weeks since Wall's surgery. It certainly appears Wall is making substantial progress, but the Wiz are in no rush to bring him back. The goal is to make sure he's as close to 100 percent as possible for the postseason. Tomas Satoransky and Bradley Beal will continue to share the ball-handling responsibilities.

             Saturday actually marks the one-year anniversary of Booker's historic 70-point eruption in Boston. Unfortunately, it appears he will be forced to watch his fourth straight game from the sideline. We should have final confirmation at approximately 5:30 pm, when coach Jay Triano addresses the media before the game. With T.J. Warren (knee) already ruled out, Josh Jackson and Troy Daniels will again be expected to log heavy minutes.

He is officially listed as questionable for Sunday's contest. Fred VanVleet and Delon Wright have seen increased minutes in his absence.

             Ingram, who has not played since March 1st, reportedly did 1-on-1 work with assistant coaches on the court on Friday and felt good Saturday morning. We should have an update on his status later in the weekend. Ingram will likely be on a minutes limit once he returns; however, he does have an enticing upside. If you have roster space in a deep league and he's still on the waiver wire, he will likely get scooped up soon.

             Thomas missed the first few months of the season due to a labrum tear in his right hip suffered at the end of the 2016-17 campaign. However, this is the first time he's been sidelined due to a hip issue since returning to game action in early January. After Monday, the Lakers return home Wednesday to play the Mavs. Thomas is certainly a cut candidate in leagues without an IR spot. Tyler Ennis will likely soak up the majority of backup PG minutes behind Lonzo Ball on Saturday and Monday.

             Dirk has been shockingly durable this season, having started a team-high 71 of the Mavs 72 games this season.

If Dirk is unable to play, Nerlens Noel and Salah Mejri will likely divvy up additional minutes.

This is the first time he's popped up on the injury report due to a hip issue, but it's possible that a nagging hip injury has contributed to the nasty slump. If Mirotic is unable to play Saturday, Cheick Diallo, Emeka Okafor and Darius Miller would likely divvy up additional minutes.

Rondo was phenomenal in the Pelicans win on Thursday, finishing with  24 points, ten assists and three steals in 31 minutes, but apparently injured his wrist in the process. DeAndre Liggins started in place of Rondo last Saturday when Rajon was rested, but Liggins tallied just three points in 20 minutes. Ian Clark will see a significant uptick in minutes off the bench. Jrue Holiday will see his usage rate spike.

            Harrison Barnes said he is far more comfortable playing small forward.
        
        
             The Mavs previously experimented with playing him at power forward for a stretch, but Barnes has played almost exclusively at SF the last four games and the results have been encouraging. Barnes is averaging 24.3 points, 4.3 rebounds and 2.8 assists, while shooting 48.7 percent from the floor and 50 percent from downtown. ""I love it,"" said Barnes. ""This is an opportunity to work on playmaking and work on scoring in different ways. I'm trying to make the most of these last games.""

He was 2-of-5 from the field and he snagged just three rebounds with two steals and two blocked shots. However, he also didn't turn the ball over, and was a solid plus-6 from the floor. As long as Draymond Green is sidelined then Looney should log plenty of minutes.

He is a solid source of points and 3-pointers. He has also been dealing with a knee injury, but he said he will be all right going forward and is just a little sore.

             Bell was making the start with Draymond Green (pelvic contusion) on the shelf. In his previous 11 starts he averaged 7.0 points, 5.1 rebounds and 3.0 assists, so he was in excess of each of those totals. If Green continues to sit then Bell has a chance to be a decent short-term fantasy option and DFS play. The Warriors will host the Jazz on Sunday.

             Muscala hit 4-of-5 from the field, including 1-of-2 from the 3-point line, while adding 2-of-2 at the free-throw line. He also pulled down seven rebounds with three assists and a blocked shot. He was still able to contribute positively despite the return of John Collins (ankle) from injury.

             Lee hit 4-of-10 from the field, including 2-of-6 from behind the 3-point line, while adding an assist and a steal. He was just signed to a second 10-day contract on Friday, and he certainly fared better than his future brother-in-law, Stephen Curry, who suffered a knee injury which will require an MRI on Saturday.

             Schroder left the game due to a left ankle injury, but he was able to return and finish up. At this point he might be a bit of a question mark for Sunday's game in Houston just in case there is swelling, etc. Isaiah Taylor would benefit the most if Schroder is held out or limited against the Rockets.

             Prince hit just 6-of-18 from the floor, although he was a solid 4-of-8 from behind the 3-point line. He also was able to add four rebounds, two assists, two steals and two blocked shots while committing just one turnover. He didn't seem to be affected or limited due to whatever was previously ailing him after a hard fall last time out.

             Collins was iffy due to a left ankle injury, and he left the game briefly for treatment in the locker room. The good news is that he was able to return and played a full allotment of minutes. He hit 4-of-7 from the field while finishing with nine points, seven rebounds, an assist and a blocked shot. It appears safe to plug him back into the active fantasy lineup if you normally rely upon him.

             Dedmon wasn't terribly efficient, even against a shorthanded Warriors team, hitting just 4-of-10 from the field while going 0-of-3 from the 3-point line. Still, the overall stat line wasn't too terrible. Next up he'll have his hands full with Clint Capela and the Rockets on Sunday evening.

             The results are not expected to be released before the Warriors practice on Saturday, but this is such a huge story that we may get a report on it at some point tomorrow. Coach Steve Kerr didn’t comment on details, but mentioned it was a ""cruel twist of fate"" after Curry worked so hard on his ankle rehab. After JaVale McGee rolled up on Curry, the Warriors will hope it’s only a Grade 1 sprain, but there’s a good chance he’ll be held out for the rest of the regular season. Quinn Cook should be busy as the starting point guard for the foreseeable future. The Warriors will want to get Curry and Kevin Durant healthy for what they obviously hope is another championship run in the playoffs.

             E.T. ended up hitting 2-of-6 from the floor, including 0-of-2 from behind the 3-point line, while adding 2-of-2 from the free-throw line. He finished with six points, two assists and a blocked shot. Turner didn't do a great job, but he might have been hindered by his sore lower back. Al-Farouq Aminu is stepping up his intensity on the offensive end, and Moe Harkless has been good lately, too, so Turner's impact isn't likely to be high in the coming days.

             You would think that the Bulls would hold him out based on the way they've handled their other players, but they may not have that Luxury as they are already going to be missing several key guys on Saturday including Kris Dunn (toe), Zach LaVine (knee, rest) and Lauri Markkanen (rest). Nwaba finished Friday's game with 10 points, four rebounds, one assist and two turnovers in 27 minutes, and he has really slowed down since his great stretch towards the end of February.

            Terry Rozier finished with 16 points across 34 minutes in Friday's 105-100 road win against the Trail Blazers.
        
        
             Rozier wasn't terribly efficient from the field, going 4-of-14, but he was 2-of-5 from behind the arc and 6-of-6 from the free-throw stripe. He also chipped in with five rebounds, two assists and a steal in the solid performance, and he did not commit any turnovers. He'll look to keep it cooking on Sunday against the defensively-challenged Kings in Sacto.

             Tatum is on a roll, averaging 19.7 points, 7.3 rebounds, 3.0 assists and 1.7 steals across the past three outings while hitting a total of five triples during the stretch. The C's are locked into the No. 2 seed in the Eastern Conference, but he is one of the younger players on the team and shouldn't be rested as much as the veterans. That's good news for his fantasy owners going forward.

             He went to the locker room in the third quarter, but later returned and seemed fine. Payne was diagnosed with a ""tweaked"" ankle, but he said he's planning to play on Saturday vs. the Pistons. We'll put him on the injury report to be safe, and he will be a strong play if he's a go as Kris Dunn (toe) doesn't have a timetable and Antonio Blakeney (wrist) is out for the season. If Payne can't play, that means we'll get to see a lot of Jerian Grant.

             Add a point to the win column for the ""revenge game"" narrative. Even if Giannis Antetokounmpo (ankle) misses more time, Snell is only worth monitoring in deeper leagues.

             Eric Bledsoe was in foul trouble which limited him to 20 minutes on the night. The Bucks don't seem interested in playing Jennings next to Bledsoe, and he averaged just 11.5 minutes per game in his previous four outings. Fantasy owners can ignore for him now despite tonight's strong line.

             Morris rolled his right ankle during the game, had it re-taped and was able to finish up. He obviously wasn't affected by the ailment, finishing an impressive 9-of-13 from the field, including 5-of-6 from behind the 3-point arc, while adding 7-of-7 from the free-throw line. He didn't really contribute much else across the board, but he also turned it over just one time.

             He did all of his damage in just 20 minutes and gave the Bucks a big lift with Giannis Antetokounmpo (ankle) on the shelf. Muhammad is usually a one-trick pony for his scoring, but filled up the box score nicely with five rebounds, three assists, two steals, one block and two triples. Antetokounmpo is expected back ""sooner rather than later,"" but the Bucks haven't provided a real timetable. If we hear that Giannis will miss more time, Muhammad will be a potential pickup with a game on Sunday and four games next week.

             His fantasy owners probably had high expectations with Giannis Antetokounmpo (ankle) out, but foul trouble was the reason for his quiet night -- he had three fouls in his first three minutes. Luckily for the Bucks, they got a big lift from Shabazz Muhammad and Brandon Jennings off the bench. Look for Bledsoe to bounce back on Sunday vs. the Spurs.

             The workload was there with 30 minutes, but he couldn't salvage his poor shooting line with just three rebounds, four assists and no defensive stats. Parker burned a lot of fantasy owners tonight because all the signs were pointing to a monster game, but we'd still recommend holding him for the time being.

             Not good. He's going to get an MRI to get more details on the severity. The similarities with this and how Zaza Pachulia rolled up on Kevin Durant in March last year are scary. KD had a Grade 2 MCL sprain from that incident, and now we have to hope this isn't the same with JaVale McGee. Quinn Cook is probably the starting point guard for the rest of the regular season while we have to hope Curry is only day-to-day.

             JaVale McGee rolled up on Curry's left leg much like how Zaza Pachulia rolled up on Kevin Durant last year, so hopefully it's not a similar outcome. Even if the Warriors dodged a bullet here, how do they put their star guard on the court after he just continues to get hurt? You would have to think he's shut down for the rest of the regular season, but we'll see what coach Steve Kerr says. Quinn Cook should be owned in standard leagues and maybe they cut someone like Omri Casspi to get him a roster spot in the postseason. They almost have to at this point.

He had the training staff around him for a couple minutes and was in pain on the floor.

"Raymond Felton

            Raymond Felton ended up with 10 points across 14 minutes off the bench Friday against the Heat.
        
        
             Felton was just one of four Thunder players to post double digits in scoring, and he led the bench in points. He hit 4-of-9 from the field, including 1-of-3 from behind the arc. He continues to be a rather risky fantasy play in seasonal leagues as long as Russell Westbrook remains healthy, but occasionally he can do enough to make DFS owners smile with decent production and a low price tag.

             He hit 2-of-4 free throws and 6-of-8 shots with just a single turnover. This is exactly what fantasy owners wanted to see after his two-point dud vs. the Clippers on Tuesday. Bjelica has played 34+ minutes in eight out of nine games in March and has been a top-50 player in 9-category leagues over the past month. If you picked up when Jimmy Butler (knee) went down, he's been a lifesaver.

             Not good. This is not his troublesome right ankle, but Curry limped noticeably to the locker room. The trainer looked at his left ankle and his left knee, so it could be both. Curry was dejected on the bench and he had a bad limp going to the locker room with GM Bob Myers right behind him. He's a good bet to be shut down again, but hopefully it's just a tweak.

He also had five turnovers, but fantasy owners have come to expect a high amount of turnovers for as much as he handles the ball. Next up is a visit against the Trail Blazers on Sunday.

             Emmanuel Mudiay played just five minutes and didn't touch the floor in the second half, while coach Jeff Hornacek praised Burke for ""controlling the pace."" Mudiay is quickly losing his grip on the starting job and there's no doubt that Burke has been the better player in recent weeks. He's averaging 14.0 points, 4.8 assists, 3.2 rebounds and 1.6 triples over his last five games and is worth a look if you need a PG.

             His defense was on full display tonight and coach Jeff Hornacek gave him props after the game for holding Andrew Wiggins (5-of-15 FGs) in check. Ntilikina also played 37 minutes tonight, a refreshing change of pace after logging 24 or fewer in his previous five games. Hopefully we'll see a lot more of The Frenchise going forward and fantasy owners targeting dimes, steals and triples should be watching him closely.

He was outplayed by both Frank Ntilikina and Trey Burke and it's clear that his leash as the starter is getting shorter and shorter.

             It was vintage Aldridge with nine mid-range makes while also mixing in some shots at the rim against the stout Jazz D. Coach Gregg Popovich usually holsters the praise, but he had no choice after what was probably the biggest win of the season. ""He’s been a horse all year long,"" Pop said of Aldridge. ""He’s basically carried us. His heart is bigger than anybody’s."" The Kawhi Leonard drama has been one of the biggest headaches all season, but it certainly hasn't been for LMA's fantasy owners.

            Kyle Lowry triple-doubled in Friday's 116-112 win over the Nets with 25 points, 12 assists, 10 rebounds and five 3-pointers.
        
        
             This was his third triple-double of the season and two of them have come against the Nets. Lowry hit 7-of-11 shots and all six of his free throws, and it seems like that rest day paid off, as the veteran PG has now scored 22+ points with 7+ dimes in four straight games. DeMar DeRozan added 21 points with three assists  and two rebounds, while Serge Ibaka notched 10 points with four rebounds, one assist, one steal and two blocks. The Raptors are running away with the No. 1 seed, so keep an eye out for possible maintenance days.

            Derrick Favors scored 22 points with eight rebounds, one assist, two blocks and one 3-pointer in 34 minutes against the Spurs on Friday.
        
        
             This confirms that Favors' night off on Tuesday for a knee issue was likely more of a precaution. He'll get a tough test against the Warriors on Sunday, but obviously his fantasy owners have to feel confident about starting him following this one and his 19-point Thursday.

            Rudy Gobert scored 13 points with eight rebounds, one assist, one steal and no blocks in 40 minutes against the Spurs on Friday.
        
        
             The Spurs went right at him all night, and you'd probably need all your fingers and toes to count the times Gobert just missed a blocked shot. LaMarcus Aldridge gave him the business with a career-high 45 points, so this one will not go on the Rudy Defensive Player of the Year highlight reel. He's been too good for his owners to complain here and he'll get a fourth game of the week on Sunday against the Warriors.

             Johnson, Wayne Ellington, Goran Dragic and Josh Richardson have each posted more than 100 3-pointers on the season. It's just the second time in franchise history that the Heat has four or more players with at least 100 triples in the same season. Miami will look to continue their 3-point barrage in Indiana on Sunday.

             The Nets have allowed the most fantasy points to centers this season and J-Val obliterated them in their previous meeting with 26 points and 14 rebounds. He finished 8-of-14 from the field and 6-of-6 from the line, but did turn the ball over three times and picked up four fouls. He gets a matchup with the Clippers on Sunday before the Raptors begin just a two-game week.

            Fred VanVleet had another strong game on Friday vs. the Nets with 16 points, six rebounds, one assist, one steal, one block and four triples in 32 minutes.
        
        
             The Raptors aren't afraid to play him big minutes alongside Kyle Lowry when he has the hot hand and that's exactly what happened tonight. Sure the Nets have allowed the second most fantasy points to PGs this season, but FVV was coming off a 16-point game with five assists, three steals and one rebound on Wednesday. The Raptors play just two games next week after their matchup vs. the Clippers on Sunday, so FVV can be dropped for a player with a more favorable schedule if you want to maximize your games played.

             Yeah, it was against the Suns, but is all right in The Land? They're on a four-game winning streak and their offense is clicking. Although, they're still one of the worst defenses in the league since the break, so that'll be a concern in the reality world. In the fantasy world, LeBron has been incredible since the break with averages of 30.6 points, 10.7 boards, 9.9 dimes, 0.8 blocks, 1.5 steals and 2.1 treys on 55.0 percent from the field in his previous 15 games. It feels like LeBron is on a mission to have a monster year without rest.

             He was just 1-of-3 from the field and also hit an uncharacteristic 3-of-8 from the line -- he was hitting 83.3% from the line prior to Friday. The Nets seem content with D'Angelo Russell running the show and Dinwiddie has now come off the bench in five straight games, averaging 10.6 points, 4.2 assists, 2.8 rebounds, 1.0 triples and 1.8 turnovers in 27.2 minutes per game.

Even though Olynyk is coming off the bench, he remains the better fantasy option over Adebayo while Hassan Whiteside (hip) is on the mend.

            Jarrett Allen scored 13 points with seven rebounds, one assist and three blocks in 26 minutes vs. the Raptors on Friday.
        
        
             Allen has struggled against bigger centers this season and tonight was no different with Jonas Valanciunas dominating on the inside, so adding strength will be a huge key for him this offseason. Still, he's progressing very quickly and doesn't even turn 20 for another month. He hit all seven of his free throws and his blocks are up again with 2.8 per game over his last five. He'll have some duds, but we'd expect another solid game against a Cleveland team that just allowed Marquese Chriss to have a big night.

             Larry Nance has been a smashing success while healthy, so Thompson's minutes are likely going to drop. He doesn't have much fantasy value even when he gets 30 minutes anyway.

             That's an encouraging sign and Nance didn't even play in the final 5:25. That should mean we see some lineups with Nance and Kevin Love, so maybe Nance can have value next to the All-Star. While Jeff Green getting sick helped, Nance should be owned in standard leagues.

All we know right now is that McCaw was holding his back on the way to the locker room followed by team trainers, but we'll have more details soon. If he can't return, Nick Young and Andre Iguodala will step up.

             He scored all 10 of his points in his first stint, but disappeared after that. Coach Kenny Atkinson seems to like him quite a bit, but the only takeaway here is that the Nets won't need to rely on Quincy Acy (DNP-CD) or Jahlil Okafor (DNP-CD) while Cunningham is healthy.

             One foul and one turnover, too! We've seen this movie before, we know all the lines and basically every person in the credits. Chriss did get a very favorable matchup today, and at times he's looked good as the center. He does get another solid matchup against the Magic on Saturday, so maybe he can string two games together. If history tells us anything, he'll somehow score negative points after this terrific game. Jokes aside, he's worth a look if you want an upside player to use.

             He returned to action for the first time since Mar. 13 on Friday vs. the Bucks, scoring nine points on 3-of-7 shots with six rebounds and one triple in just 22 minutes. The Bulls would love to improve their draft position, so no one should be surprised that Markkanen is going to be held out on Saturday. The good news is that he didn't suffer any setbacks and coach Fred Hoiberg said the plan is for him to play on Tuesday vs. the Rockets.

             Adebayo was a dismal 0-of-5 from the field, as he looks like he was shooting into a soup can. Offense isn't really his strong suit, but man can he rebound. He is averaging 8.3 rebounds per game. However, he also is putting up just 4.4 points per game across the past 10 outings. Kelly Olynyk continues to do more even in a reserve role, and he is the player to start in fantasy leagues while Hassan Whiteside (hip) remains on the shelf.

Payton gets a revenge game vs. Orlando on Saturday, so that could be the last chance for him. Keep an eye on Ulis or give him a look in a good matchup for Saturday.

             Russell added a steal with a pair of turnovers in 31 minutes, becoming the first Net since Terrance Williams (2010) to record a triple-double. That's the good news. The bad news is that Russell hit 8-of-21 shots and 2-of-5 from the line, bringing his shooting percentages down to 41.5% from the field and 74.1% from the line on the season. His efficiency has been holding him back in category leagues, but you can't complain about the counting stats this month. He gets a great matchup vs. the Cavaliers on Sunday, as they are allowing the fifth most fantasy points to PGs this season.

             Something is wrong with Elfrid right now. He is making lazy passes, he isn't locked in on defense and he doesn't shoot effective shots right now. He's losing run at key points in games and he's a drop candidate. Coach Jay Triano has called him out for defense, and it was worse today. He does get a revenge game on Saturday against the Magic, so maybe that gets him going. Maybe?

             The Nuggets had to have this game and they came through. Their schedule is the hardest in the NBA and they really won't be seeing any tanking teams, and they'll have to hope some of their East opponents rest guys against them. Jokic is almost certainly not going to rest at all at least until the last week of the season.

             He wasn't ruled out until a few minutes after tip-off, but this isn't a new injury which suggests he may have tweaked it in warmups. With Napier out, that means Evan Turner will have even more responsibility with the second unit.

             He scored 20 in the first half and was taking a lot of shots early in the third, but halftime cooled him off. Murray made a big impact in the first half on the glass with three offensive boards, but of course it's about the offense with his 21.2 points per game over his last five. He should get a bump until Gary Harris (knee) is back, which should be this week.

             The blocks were one off his career high with two of them coming within seconds of each other in the first half. All of Barton's makes came from either the line (8-of-8) or from deep. As expected, his minutes are surging with Gary Harris (knee) out -- not counting garbage time. Harris could still miss more time, but you're going to lean on The Thrill regardless.

             His minutes were way down in the last two games with just 31 in each, but not tonight in a tough loss. Beal continues to play point guard at times and his increase in assists has been a big takeaway this season. He's fifth in the NBA for total minutes played and has been durable now that he's over that fibula stress fracture. John Wall could be back next week, but Beal will do damage regardless.

             He checked out and had the trainer take a look at what may have been his hamstring, and he also looked at his right ankle. He didn't limp too much, so hopefully he's getting re-taped.

Jordan has been incredible on the boards with 18.5 per game this month before tonight, and 11 tonight is his lowest since Feb. 27. He also made both free throws and is playing some of his best ball of the season.

             He did look to hurt his left hand in the final minutes of the game, but Rivers shot the free throws and he didn't appear to have tape on his hand.

He leads the NBA in fourth-quarter scoring and almost brought his team back if not for a very late Pacers run. He's locked in for a huge offensive role as the Clippers battle for the postseason.

Mike Muscala is the biggest loser with Collins returning, but Dewayne Dedmon's value should be fine with Collins playing a lot of PF before the injury.

             This could mean the Warriors do want to dial back Andre Iguodala. Also, they could want to get McCaw going after a slow start and getting him next to Steph has to help. Either way, just about all fantasy owners can take a wait-and-see approach here on Patty Mac.

             There's no word of any restrictions, and Nurk Alert seemed fine on Tuesday when he notched 21 points with 11 rebounds. Deploy him like you normally would and check back for a post-game update.

             That's great news. He's expected to be back sooner rather than later, which is obviously great news. Antetokounmpo is not playing tonight and it'll be Jabari Parker getting a green light for more minutes.

             The Lakers briefly listed him as doubtful, so that's a small win if you're stashing him for next week and beyond. The Lakers did sign Travis Wear for the rest of the season and maybe it has a little to do with Ingram. The Lakers rotation is tight right now, so fire up basically everyone that is seeing over 24 minutes.

With T.J. Warren (knee) also out, Josh Jackson is a strong play in all formats if you don't mind his volatile shooting percentages, while Troy Daniels is worth a long look if you need to stream 3-pointers.

             Coach Spoelstra loves this line, but it basically means Wade will play if he doesn't tweak anything in warmups. Spoelstra added that Wade will see limited minutes if he's a go, but that's expected after a five-game absence. Wayne Ellington, Rodney McGruder and Justise Winslow all lose a bit of value with Wade expected to play.

             It's a hometown game for the Chicagoan and he gets a huge opportunity. The coaching staff talked him up and his added opportunity, so Parker could get minutes in the mid 30s. ""If we can stretch him out to that many minutes — if we need to — we will,"" coach Joe Prunty said. He gets a dream matchup against a struggling defense and there's so much usage available, so Parker has his best opportunity to post a monster night. Expect to see Shabazz Muhammad out there more often and he could score in the teens.

The Nuggets need every win they can get and there will be some added pressure on Millsap on both ends, especially with Gary Harris (knee) out. He's obviously a player you need in your season-long league, but there's some risk to play a guy at less than 100 percent.

Zipser missed eight games in a row the last time he was on the injury report with this foot issue, so the Bulls will be cautious.

             He is basically a game-time call because he'll go through warmups first to make sure there's not too much stiffness in his back. It sounds like Markkanen is back in action, but it's worth a mention that the Bulls start a back-to-back set. If he is back, that would hurt Noah Vonleh the most while Cristiano Felicio would lose playing time. Bobby Portis should be OK either way.

If Booker is able to play tonight, there's a good chance the Suns hold him out on Saturday. Troy Daniels and Josh Jackson are the big winners if Booker sits.

            Andrew Harrison (wrist) is questionable to play against the Lakers on Saturday.
        
        
             The Grizzlies are expected to play Kobi Simmons tomorrow, so we'd probably say Harrison is closer to doubtful here. Of course, all bets are off on who sits for the Grizzlies.

             He played just six minutes in his last outing and it doesn't sound like the Grizzlies are resting any of their bigs, so there are no real fantasy implications here.

             He went through shootaround today and it'll be interesting to see if Nance or Thompson check in first. Now that Kevin Love is back, Nance is likely going to have a tough time hitting 20 minutes in some matchups.

He's risky in DFS, but season-long owners should obviously roll the dice on him and he's coming off a monster game.

             Coach Ty Lue said Hood will be on a minutes restriction, so he's a risky play even without Kyle Korver (personal). Hood played just 18 minutes in his last outing before sitting out three straight games, so it's possible he sees around 20 minutes tonight.

            John Wall (knee) could practice on Saturday, according to coach Scott Brooks.
        
        
             ""He's ready to take it to another level,"" Brooks said. The coach did add Wall needs a ""handful"" of practices before he plays, but he said that amount is ""more than one, less than 20."" Well, based on that we know Wall needs at least two practices to play, and he may have a minutes limit for multiple games. Wall could be worth stashing, but it may not be up to speed until April. Tomas Satoransky should still be owned until Wall has a target date.

If he can't go, the Nuggets may opt to go small with Wilson Chandler at the four, but Trey Lyles and Mason Plumlee would likely benefit most.

             He's getting closer and was called questionable before this news, so maybe he can play on Sunday. With him, Kevin Durant and Draymond Green out, that opens up a ton of forward minutes for starter Jordan Bell, Kevon Looney, Andre Iguodala and Nick Young. Iggy and Bell look like the best two targets, but rolling with Looney or Swaggy could work too.

             He's looked the part of a rotation player and looked good on Thursday with 13 points in 22 minutes. He'll likely get another start tonight and could be worth a look as a DFS punt. He also gets a game against his future brother-in-law, Stephen Curry, in tonight's game, so that could be a fun narrative.

             This is a mild surprise after the Hawks ruled him out a day before yesterday's game against the Kings. He'll likely be a game-time call and we won't get news on it until late tonight because the Hawks won't shoot around today. If he's back, that will hurt Mike Muscala the most, but Dewayne Dedmon should still be OK to use.

             This is expected after Harden rolled his ankle against the Pistons last night. He did return and finished on a high note with 10 points in OT, but this is important to note on the front end of a back-to-back set. The Rockets are going to start to rest players and Harden has MVP locked up. Plus, it does make some sense to rest him Saturday to allow a little added revenge for Eric Gordon and Ryan Anderson. We should get an update tomorrow, but Harden's owners should expect him to sit one game this weekend.

             Coach Rick Carlisle said that DSJ was likely going to play, so this also fits in with that quote. If so, Smith Jr. only needed to miss two games from his Saturday ankle tweak. It's also not a back-to-back set and the Mavs are off until Tuesday following this one, so the rookie could be ready to roll. Yogi Ferrell and J.J. Barea would take a hit here.

             This could be fun. Bell was up to 23 minutes way back on Monday in the last game, so all this time off could get him close to 30 minutes. In Bell's previous 11 starts, he averaged 7.0 points, 5.1 boards, 3.0 assists, 1.6 blocks and 1.0 steals in 21.3 minutes. That absolutely works and it's possible Dray is out beyond tonight, so adding Bell makes a lot of sense in standard leagues, especially with how thin the Warriors are.

             This serves as welcomed confirmation, as Curry was listed as probable and has been practicing with the team for the past few days. Curry should be locked and loaded in all fantasy formats. Quinn Cook had posted very impressive numbers in the three games he started for Steph (averaging 24.3 points, 4.0 assists and 4.3 rebounds) but will get bumped back to the bench with Curry returning to action.

             Paul tweaked his hamstring in the closing seconds of Tuesday's win over the Blazers. CP3 has downplayed the injury since it happened. However, the Rockets are smartly erring on the side of caution with their star guard. Paul has dealt with nagging hamstring issues since the start of the season, and Houston has virtually locked up the No. 1 spot in the West. Thus, they have no need to rush him back until he is 100 percent healthy. Gerald Green and Eric Gordon will again see an uptick in minutes Saturday night.

            Coach Erik Spoelstra said that Dwyane Wade (hamstring) went through shootaround and ""might play"" Friday night vs. OKC.
        
        
             Wade, who has missed each of Miami's last five games, is officially listed as questionable. Friday's game tips-off at 8:00 pm EST, so we should have a final update on Wade's status at approximately 6:30 pm, when Coach Spo addresses the media pregame. Should Wade return, he'll eat into Wayne Ellington, Rodney McGruder and Justise Winslow's minutes.

            The Celtics announced on Friday that Kyrie Irving will undergo a minimally invasive procedure on Saturday to alleviate irritation in his left knee.
        
        
             The Celtics press release  adds that ""further information will be provided following [Saturday’s] procedure, and the team will have no further comment until that time."" Irving had already been ruled out of the team's four-game road trip, which begins Friday and concludes next Wednesday. While waiting for another update, we have to assume that this procedure means he'll be sidelined longer than just a week. Wait one more day for official word from the team if you must, but Irving will likely have to be waived in all re-draft leagues. Terry Rozier is locked into the starting PG spot and heavy minutes going forward.

             This is not surprising news, as Antetokounmpo was listed as doubtful for this contest. He initially injured the ankle on Wednesday night in the second quarter of Milwaukee's loss to the Clippers. He had a slight limp as he made his way to the locker room and was ruled out of the second half. However, the Bucks still have yet to provide a formal update, and we don't know the severity of the injury. Jabari Parker is expected to be inserted into the starting lineup on Friday. Eric Bledsoe and Khris Middleton will likely see their usage rates spike.

Even if he is unable to play Friday, it appears he has a good shot at returning to game action Sunday vs. the Nets.

            Rodney Hood (back) is questionable for Friday's game vs. the Suns.
        
        
             Hood has missed three straight due to the nagging back issue. Coach Larry Drew did say Hood was nearing a return, so we should expect an update after the Cavs shootaround this afternoon. Jose Calderon was inserted in the starting lineup on Wednesday vs. the Raptors.

            Larry Nance (hamstring) is listed out in the game notes for Friday's matchup vs. Phoenix.
        
        
             Nance has missed each of the Cavs last four games since injuring his hamstring last week. However, he was reportedly targeting this weekend for a return. His next chance to suit up will be on Sunday vs. Brooklyn. Yet, the fact that he wasn't upgraded to questionable for Friday's contest isn't promising. Moreover, even when fully healthy, he'll have a reduced role in the Cavs offense with Kevin Love back in the lineup.

             De’Aaron Fox was seriously struggling with his jumper, so Dave Joerger opted to close out the game with Mason at the point, and he made some really nice plays down the stretch to help seal the deal for the Kings. Unfortunately for Mason, Fox is still going to be the starting point guard in Sacramento, meaning his minutes will be too inconsistent for him to sustain much value in most formats.

             Fox just didn’t play well, missing layups and wide-open looks and he was benched down the stretch in favor of Frank Mason III. Fox is typically good for some points and dimes, but he rarely contributes much on the defensive end, struggles with turnovers and isn’t a great free throw shooter. He’s really nothing more than a low-end PG to own in deep leagues.

             Bogdanovic got off to a solid start, going 4-of-6 from the field, but he subbed out midway through the third quarter and never got back into the game. Hopefully, he didn’t tweak his hamstring and the low minutes were just a result of Dave Joerger’s wonky rotations, but this is a situation we’ll be monitoring closely. We should have more than a few updates leading up to Sunday’s game against the Celtics.

             Koufos has played well when given the minutes this season, but the problem is that he’s working in a loaded frontcourt, which essentially guarantees inconsistent playing time. Additionally, the defensive stats were an anomaly, as Koufos has only once averaged more than a block per game over the course of a season throughout his nine-year career, and that was five years ago. He’s really nothing more than a low-end, rebounding specialist in deep leagues.

             Sacramento ran a lot of their offense through Skal early on, but he just couldn’t get his shot to drop. Still, he came through with the swats and added a bonus triple. Labissiere’s inconsistency can be maddening, but you can make a case for owning him as a low-end big in deep leagues.

             Jackson was also a perfect 4-of-4 from beyond the arc, and he’s been shooting the lights out over the past two games, going 14-of-17 from the field, which obviously isn’t sustainable.

He also had a fun moment in the fourth when he put his hops on display by throwing down a furious jam (link below), but as good as he was, Schroder will be back in action on Friday which will seriously hinder Taylor’s upside. He’ll be someone to consider as a streamer in deep leagues when Schroder is rested, but he’s not worth owning in most leagues.

             No surprise here with the Rockets having a back-to-back set coming up on Saturday. With Mbah a Moute out, Joe Johnson, Ryan Anderson and P.J. Tucker will pick up some extra minutes.

             He carried his team late with some strong drives to the hoop. Mitchell's season is in rare air all time for scoring, and his 24th 25-plus point game tonight ties LeBron James for his rookie season. Mitchell does so much more than score and he's strung together nine straight games with at least one steal and one 3-pointer. He might be a second-round pick next year after being arguably the best add in fantasy during his rookie season.

             That's an encouraging bounce-back game after the Jazz lost without him on Tuesday.

The Jazz have some tough games coming up, so expect Favors to be out there.

             The Mavs continue to list him on the injury report, but Barea did play 29 minutes on Tuesday. It'll be interesting to see what happens if Dennis Smith Jr. does play because the Mavs may want to get a look at Aaron Harrison. Barea could be worth owning while he's active, but he'll almost certainly miss multiple games the rest of the way. He doesn't have a back-to-back set on Saturday, for what it's worth.

He’s fully capable of this sort of production when given the minutes, so hopefully, Luke Walton holds off on giving meaningful minutes to Ivica Zubac until the fantasy season is over with.

             Holiday had a very strong start to this one, missing just three of his first 10 shots through the first half of action, and as an added bonus for 9-cat owners, he didn't commit a single turnover. He was clutch down the stretch, helping New Orleans go on a big run in the fourth to get them back in the game, and this was a solid bounce-back performance after being held to just 10 points on Wednesday.

             It sounds like coach Rick Carlisle is going to pick Mejri or Nerlens Noel for his backup five minutes. Mejri is probably not going to play on Saturday, but that's a guess on our part for now.

            Anthony Davis scored 33 points on 12-of-20 shooting in Thursday's 128-125 win over the Lakers, adding nine boards, three steals, two blocks and one assist in 37 minutes.
        
        
             Lakers coach Luke Walton summed up the challenge of trying to defend AD pretty well prior to the game, saying: ""He just scores all over. It’s not like he’s got a go-to that you can kind of take away from him. Offensive rebounds, transition buckets, putting it on the ground, the step-backs, the three-point shots, he really does it all."" Accurate. Davis did appear to tweak his right (shooting) hand late in the game, but he played through it and didn't seem any worse for the wear, so he should be good to go for Saturday's game in Houston.

             The Pelicans are gradually increasing Hill’s minutes limit, but it’s unlikely he’ll be a large enough part of the rotation this season to make a difference in fantasy hoops. Leave him on the wire.

             Mirotic has been mired in a shooting slump for about two months now, but he’s been particularly bad over the past six, connecting on just 31.4% of his shot attempts to go with averages of 9.5 points, 7.8 boards and 1.1 triples per contest. He should turn it around eventually, but you could make a case for cutting him in shallower leagues if you’re locked in a tough playoff matchup.

             This was a solid bounce-back performance following Wednesday’s 1-of-6 shooting, two-point disaster, and Rondo also did a really nice job defensively against Lonzo Ball. He made numerous clutch plays down the stretch, running the offense to perfection and also hit two huge shots with two minutes left to give New Orleans the lead. The Pelicans won all three games of their back-to-back-to-back set, moving them into fourth place out West.

             He scored 10 of his 21 in overtime alone to top the entire Pistons team 10-8 to earn their franchise-record-tying 58th win this season. Harden did also land on Blake Griffin's foot to tweak his ankle, but he stayed in after he was briefly in pain. The Rockets are going to start to rest players and they do have a back-to-back set on Saturday and Sunday, so Harden owners will have to be on red alert for rest this weekend.

             That's his first triple-double as a Piston, but it's not a surprise as the assists continue to trend up with 6.7 per game in his previous games this month. Griffin was also starting to shoot the ball better from the field and his minutes have been high when the Pistons can stay in games. We'll see if that changes once the Pistons get eliminated from the postseason later this month.

            Ish Smith scored 18 points with eight rebounds, three assists, one block and two 3-pointers in 33 minutes against the Rockets on Thursday.
        
        
             It was one of his best games in a while and he did play the overtime frame because Reggie Jackson likely hit his minutes limit. Smith has actually played OK in the last three games and his minutes are up with at least 30 in each of his last three, but still it'll be tough to count on him with Reggie Jackson likely to see more minutes.

            Joel Embiid scored 17 points with nine rebounds, three assists, one steal, one block and one 3-pointer in just 20 minutes during an easy 118-98 win over the Magic on Thursday.
        
        
             Fantasy owners may not like the light playing time, but the 76ers have to love it in a back-to-back set. Coach Brett Brown has suggested rest will come for Embiid at some point, but the team sounds like they really want to move up to the three seed. The 76ers don't have a back-to-back set until Apr. 3, so The Process should be good until then.

             That's his 20th double-digit dime game of his career. That's the most among any 76ers rookie and the most since any rookie since John Wall back in 2010-11. Simmons has been better than expected, and he has a great shot at Rookie of the Year despite what coach Rick Carlisle said. ""He isn’t a rookie,"" Carlisle said on Thursday.

             This wasn't about garbage time with 13 points in his first seven minutes of action. Ilyasova has been a great fit for Philly in his time there, but he can't be used in most fantasy leagues unless guys are resting.

             He is really struggling again, making just 34.0 percent from the field over his last five outings. Hezonja should be looking at minutes close to 30 most nights while Jonathon Simmons (wrist) and Jonathan Isaac (foot) are out, so he has upside.

             The good news is that he's healthy and he has shown plenty of highlight-reel hops. The bad news is Gordon is back to one of his sloppy runs with poor shot selection. He should still be starting in all leagues.

             He seems to have his coach's trust based on the comments before the game. ""[Iwundu] is in there because he’s played well,"" coach Frank Vogel said. ""I thought about starting him last game, but like any veteran coach would be, I was a bit apprehensive about starting two rookies."" Good quote aside, Iwundu isn't much of a stat stuffer, so he's only a desperation stream while Jonathon Simmons is out.

             This obviously had to do with garbage time, but Purvis impressed with some nice scores in the halfcourt. There's some talk of the Magic playing younger guys more, so maybe this affects D.J. Augustin or Shelvin Mack.

             He outscored the Grizzlies by himself in the first quarter and the Hornets put up the biggest margin of victory in a game this season -- sixth largest all time. He set a franchise record for treys in a game and tied Steph Curry for most treys in a game this season. Kemba also set a franchise record for the most 30-point games as a Hornet with 55. He's been terrific all year and there's no sign of him getting a night off based on coach Steve Clifford's comment. Walker looks like a second-round player in drafts for next season, too.

             Dwight Howard was suspended for this game and Cody Zeller (knee) was out, so he was the only true center left. Coach Steve Clifford has been talking up Willy lately and now he may be able to see minutes consistently. However, his upside won't be great when Dwight is active.

             He saw more minutes because the Hornets put up the sixth-biggest margin of victory in NBA history. Bacon should still see some minutes in the second unit, but Jeremy Lamb has a strong grip on the starting job while Nic Batum is out.

            Tyreke Evans scored 16 points with seven rebounds, four assists, one steal, one block, six turnovers and one 3-pointer in 19 minutes during a 140-79 loss to the Hornets on Thursday.
        
        
             Hey, at least he got to rest for most of this game in the worst loss in franchise history. Evans did look disinterested when he didn't have the ball in his hands, and some of those six turnovers were inexcusable. According to the Memphis broadcast, coach J.B. Bickerstaff got on his team after a timeout due to a lack of effort, and Evans was subbed out at that point. Maybe it was about Evans, maybe it wasn't. Evans is going to be at risk of rest basically any night, so it's really tough to keep him on your roster, especially with just 19 minutes tonight because of garbage time.

             He had a lot of trouble in the first quarter, but he did get some stats in garbage time. Davis will move back to the bench on Saturday, and it's worth a mention he hasn't fared well in his two starts with this one and a two-point Monday.

On the bright side, his minutes are back up after playing just 12 on Monday and 25 on Wednesday -- foul trouble got him Monday.

             He scored the ball well in the first quarter and picked up several buckets in garbage time. Selden's quad injury looks to be behind him and playing in a back-to-back bodes well for him. He could be an option when the Grizzlies rest guys, which will happen a lot.

            Chris Paul (hamstring) will not play on Thursday against the Pistons, but he will likely play on Saturday against the Pelicans, according to coach Mike D'Antoni.
        
        
             ""Probably tomorrow he'll be ready, but we don't know,"" D'Antoni said. ""He has a good chance of playing this weekend. We'll see."" Paul's hamstring strain is minor and this is more about rest than anything else. His fantasy owners can expect him to be back for Saturday, but he'll be getting rest at some point later this season. Look for Gerald Green and Eric Gordon to get some extra shots.

             Marc Gasol is getting his standard rest day on the second leg of a back-to-back, so Davis will get the call to start tonight, but with averages of just 8.0 points, 5.3 boards and not much else over his three starts this season, he's not a great target in most formats. Joining Davis in the starting five will be Tyreke Evans, Dillon Brooks, Jarell Martin and JaMychal Green. Tank on.

             Chris Paul is not expected to play today unless he insists, so it'll be Gordon out there. He should see minutes in the 30s and may get double-digit 3-pointers, so he'll have a chance for several points. Expect Gerald Green to be in Gordon's role as the trigger man off the bench while the other forwards should see more minutes, too.RotoGrinders.com Daily Slant: James Harden becomes the top overall play on the slate quickly (if he wasn't already before) - with Paul and all other inactive/non-rotation members off the floor, Harden averages an insane 1.66 FPPM with a 41.1% usage rate. That's good for a +2.7% usage bump and a +0.09 FPPM increase. Eric Gordon actually doesn't benefit in terms of usage/FPPM, but he does pick up more court time with Paul out and that alone makes him a solid mid-range target industry wide.

             It'll be his fourth start of his career and second at guard. Iwundu played 20 minutes on Tuesday, but now he has a chance to hit 30 minutes because the Magic are expected to play their young guys more. Plus, there are more wing minutes available this time around. His upside isn't the highest, but he's worth a look as a desperation stream or a DFS tourney punt.

            Tyreke Evans is expected to be available for Thursday against the Hornets.
        
        
             To be clear, we still wouldn't be surprised to see the Grizzlies pull Evans from this game, especially with Dwight Howard not playing. He really can't be trusted in fantasy unless he's officially in the starting lineup, and he's still not someone to entirely trust in that scenario. If Evans is back, Andrew Harrison and Wayne Selden take hits.

             No surprise here and hopefully Z-Bo is OK from his illness. With him out, there could be a few extra minutes going to Kosta Koufos, Willie Cauley-Stein and Skal Labissiere. All three are worth a look in DFS with WCS and Skal worth owning in standard leagues.

             CP3 downplayed his hamstring issue from Tuesday, but there's little reason to play him based on how many left hamstring strains he's suffered in his career. The Rockets are also going to start resting guys, so keep an eye out for that. With him likely out, Eric Gordon, Gerald Green, and the other forwards should see a few more minutes.

             You wouldn't know Nurkic was hurt on Tuesday with his monster 21-point, 11-board game vs. Clint Capela. If he can't go, Ed Davis gets a little bump while there could be more Zach Collins and Meyers Leonard. It's possible Leonard starts, but Davis is the guy you would want to use in fantasy.

Nick Young and Pat McCaw should handle the SG minutes while Quinn Cook could slide over, too. We'd consider Klay doubtful for Sunday, too.

             He is starting to do some on-court work and maybe there's a small chance he can make it back before his two-week timetable. Still, the Warriors have no reason to bring him back early, so KD is still likely out until very late March. it's important to note that there's no word of him taking on contact, so that will be the biggest step here. Andre Iguodala, Pat McCaw and Nick Young will pick up some extra wing minutes.

             It sounds like he'll be back, which isn't a surprise after he was going through practice for most of the week. Curry's ankle injury didn't look nearly as bad, but the fact that he's suffered so many right ankle injuries was a huge factory. Obviously fire him up in all leagues while Quinn Cook takes a big hit.

             The plan is for him to practice on Saturday and hopefully he'll be playing on Sunday. Green himself has talked a lot about rest, and said the Warriors will be resting more ""here and there"" going forward. With him out, that should help Kevon Looney and Jordan Bell get more run at the four. Looney has been solid, so he's worth a look for the short term.

             That's a step up after he was ruled out two days ahead of Wednesday's game. Maybe Sabonis feels better tomorrow, but chances are he's not back. That means we'll see more Al Jefferson while Myles Turner has a longer leash.

             That's a very good sign and perhaps he did even more work to progress in the protocol, but he is not going to play on Friday. Once he's back, that would take away from Shane Larkin, Marcus Morris and especially Abdel Nader. Brown's upside isn't too high, so most owners may want to wait for him to get the green light before adding him.

             This has been one of the weirder injuries of the month because his first game out came as a surprise way back on Mar. 10. It was called ""hip pain"" and it was later called a strain, and the Heat have been fairly quiet on details. It's certainly possible Whiteside misses more time, especially because the Heat are basically just playing for playoff position. Kelly Olynyk is the hottest fantasy property in the league while Bam Adebayo, James Johnson and Justise Winslow also benefit.

            Kawhi Leonard did receive support from some teammates in the players-only meeting, and the team wanted to wait for him to be healthy before he returns, according to Jabari Young of the San Antonio Express-News.
        
        
             This local report adds Kawhi was caught off guard, but he told the team returning was still a goal. Additionally, Danny Green tweeted out it ""couldn't be anymore incorrect"" regarding a report saying the players-only meeting was about imploring Kawhi to return. The reporting on Kawhi Leonard has been a mess all year, which isn't surprising because they're easily the most secretive team in the NBA. The bottom line here is don't put too much stock in Kawhi reports going forward.

             This confirms what was said yesterday, so are you ready for what could be Willy Hernangomez vs. Deyonta Davis? Did Tyreke Evans wake up on the right side of the bed? We'll see what the Grizzlies have set up for tonight, but all bets are off on others besides Gasol getting the night off. It should be Davis, Jarell Martin, JaMychal Green and we might even see more Brice Johnson to help out.

             He picked up his 16th technical foul of the season on Wednesday which results in an automatic one-game suspension. If Cody Zeller (knee) is unable to play vs. Memphis, that means we'll likely get an extended look at Willy Hernangomez. Howard will return to the lineup on Saturday vs. the Mavericks.

             This is all we have to work with and we still don't know the severity. Maybe the Bucks are just being cautious given the opponent, as Giannis didn't appear to have a bad limp when he left Wednesday's game early. We'll pass along any additional details, but Jabari Parker should start and will get a significant bump in value against his hometown team. Eric Bledsoe and Khris Middleton will also be very busy.

             He was able to play through the wrist injury on Wednesday, scoring six points with three rebounds, three assists and one turnover in 23 minutes. The Bulls are going to be without Kris Dunn (toe) and Zach LaVine (knee), meaning we should see a healthy dose of Cameron Payne, Jerian Grant, David Nwaba, Denzel Valentine and Justin Holiday at positions 1-3.

             He's already missed eight games with this foot injury before briefly returning, but hopefully this is just a minor setback. The Bulls are going to be very shorthanded on Friday, so expect them to use a committee approach to soak up Zipser's minutes with guys like Denzel Valentine, David Nwaba and Justin Holiday all in the mix.

             The Bulls are in no rush to bring Dunn back at less than 100 percent, and considering he's still in a walking boot, we'll mark him as out indefinitely. Cameron Payne will continue to start at PG and has done well for the most part, averaging 9.3 points, 7.3 assists, 3.0 rebounds, 1.0 blocks, 0.7 steals and 2.0 triples through three starts.

             After five games on the shelf with a minor back issue, the rookie big man might be ready to return (it's probably up to the Bulls). He was limited to non-contact work at Tuesday's practice, and it's fair to expect some restrictions if he's cleared to play. If Markkanen is a go, Noah Vonleh will lose a good chunk of minutes and Bobby Portis' value will take a hit.

             He missed nearly three weeks with this wrist injury before playing in the previous two games, so the Grizzlies might be cautious on the second night of a back-to-back. Tyreke Evans is expected to play Thursday, so Harrison's upside is going to be limited if he's able to play. Briante Weber will also pick up some minutes if Harrison is out, but unlike Evans, he's not a fantasy option in most leagues.

            According to ESPN, the Spurs held a players-only meeting to ""implore"" Kawhi Leonard (quad) to return to the lineup and help them make a playoff push.
        
        
             The drama continues. The meeting was reportedly ""tense and emotional at times"" with Tony Parker and several teammates ""expressing frustration and confusion over a growing divide with Leonard."" Kawhi was ""resolute in response"" and insisted that he had a good reason for sitting out -- his medical staff has yet to clear him even though Leonard ""impressed"" his coaches and teammates in 3-on-3 and 4-on-4 workouts. With just 10 games left, we'll find out soon enough if this meeting convinces Leonard to make a return and potentially give the Spurs a glimmer of hope in the postseason.

             This means we can safely rule him out on Thursday vs. the Jazz. J.J. Barea stepped up in DSJ's absence on Tuesday, scoring 10 points with eight assists and four rebounds in 29 minutes. Yogi Ferrell was also productive with 15 points, three rebounds, two assists, one steal and one triple in 27 minutes. Both players are quality streaming options on a six-game Thursday slate.

             At least his fantasy owners have time for a backup plan, as Simmons was previously listed as doubtful. Tank commander Arron Afflalo might get a start, but you're not trusting him in fantasy lineups. Look for Shelvin Mack and Wes Iwundu to pick up some extra minutes as well.

             No surprise here, as both of these players were considered doubtful on the previous injury report. Isaac has shown a lot of promise, especially on the defensive end, but fantasy owners should move on because it sounds like he could miss additional time -- getting ruled out this early is usually a bad sign. With Isaac out, Khem Birch may pick up some run at the four and Mario Hezonja is in line for more minutes as well. Birch and Hezonja are hard to trust with Aaron Gordon healthy, though.

He's also taking less  pull-up 3s (he's only hitting those at a 30% clip) which explains why he's been so effective lately.  ""I love that he’s shooting the catch-and-shoot much more,"" Atkinson said. ""He’s getting to the rim more, his finishing is improving.

""I think it’s going to be exciting. It’s the first time I’m actually going to have a chance to go where I want to go."" Tyson Chandler isn't expected to play again this season and Alan Williams isn't expected to make his season debut until next week, so Len will get an opportunity to showcase himself on Friday and Saturday and will look to build off his 19-point performance with 12 rebounds, one assist and three blocks.

Payton has a horrendous defensive rating of 115.8 with the Suns and he's been pulled out of games several times after a blown assignment. He's also struggling on the offensive end and teams are sagging off him and daring him to shoot. He did play well when he first arrived in Phoenix, but he's now trending down in a hurry, averaging 8.6 points, 4.6 assists, 2.0 rebounds, 0.6 steals and 2.6 turnovers over his last five games. This is horrible timing for his fantasy owners and for Payton himself as he becomes a restricted free agent this summer.

He's not on the standard-league radar yet.

             ""It’s a combination of everything. There are other players who might be better at this, or a little bit better at that. But when you put everything together, and the way he passes, the way he sees teammates, the way he can lob, the way he can fight through a foul,"" D'Antoni said. ""I mean even on an off night, he’s probably getting 30, 40 points, and I mean efficiently."" Harden leads the league with 31.2 points per game and is third in assists (8.7), and he's running away with the MVP Award as the Rockets are sitting comfortably in 1st place with the best record in the NBA.

             ""My ultimate goal is to return to Denver,"" he said. ""You know me, I’m a real loyal guy. I’m real big on that. They gave me a chance to really showcase what I could do. So, I would love to finish what I started here."" Barton is set to see a considerable raise after being on the books for just $3.53 million in 2017-18, as he's having his best year yet with career-highs in points (15.0), assists (4.1), blocks (0.6) and triples (1.8). He's the sixth man in Denver, so a move to a new city may not hurt his value if he can find a starting gig.

             ""We’ll look at all possibilities, but he’ll play some five for sure,"" D’Antoni said. ""Then, we’ll see. Matchups, maybe in the playoffs, will be different here and there, but right now we’re going to look at this."" Normally a player will see a bump in value when they play multiple positions, but the Rockets are keeping Anderson's minutes down to keep him healthy and because they have so many options with small-ball lineups. Since returning from his hip injury, Anderson is averaging a mere 12.3 minutes per game.

             Oubre sank 9-of-17 shots with just two turnovers in 34 minutes, putting the second unit on his back tonight without Mike Scott (flu) or Jodie Meeks (flu) available. He's racking up copious steals and 3-pointers and is a valuable source of weighted FT%, which makes him worth holding despite some recent inconsistency.

             The Wizards still haven't won at San Antonio since 1999 and the Spurs' defense gets credit for Morris' lousy night. After really struggling defensively in February, the Spurs have again tightened the screws during their five-game win streak. Morris was hot in his past three games and should fare better this weekend vs. the visiting Nuggets (Friday) and Knicks (Sunday).

             It's still unclear when John Wall (knee surgery) might return, although he's hoping to resume 5-on-5 workouts by the end of the week. The Wizards will take every precaution with him, including likely DNPs during their remaining back-to-back sets, which helps bolster Satoransky's rest-of-season outlook. This was his first scoreless game since mid-January, and for now owners can keep plugging him into lineups.

Kawhi Leonard's quad injury saga has thrust LA into the spotlight for the Spurs, to his fantasy owners' delight.

With a usage rate of just 12.1% since the All-Star break, he's nearly useless in most points-leagues.

The Bucks get the lowly Bulls on Friday, so maybe the team is careful with their star player. If he's out, Jabari Parker benefits most while Shabazz Muhammad, Eric Bledsoe and Khris Middleton should all step up.

New Orleans is in the thick of a very competitive playoff race in the West and there have been no indications that they'll rest anyone on the team -- Davis included. Head coach Alvin Gentry said they wanted to keep AD around 32 minutes per game during this extra-busy stretch, yet he's played 35 in consecutive games. Expect more of the same unless Thursday's game becomes a blowout.

            Eric Bledsoe scored 19 points with three rebounds, eight assists, one steal and one 3-pointer in 36 minutes against the Clippers on Wednesday.
        
        
             Unlike Khris Middleton, Bledsoe doesn't get the crazy boost without Giannis Antetokounmpo (ankle). Bledsoe only gets a 3.3 usage rate boost without Giannis, and his efficiency goes way down. That said, Bledsoe could put up some mega stat lines while Giannis is out.

            Cheick Diallo played 20 minutes off the bench on Wednesday, scoring nine points (2-of-3 FGs and 5-of-5 FTs) with 10 rebounds and one block.
        
        
             The second-year forward played 24 minutes in each of the past two games, averaging 13.5 points and 10.0 rebounds in that span. He added just 0.5 assists without any defensive stats, though, so it was nice to see him swat a shot tonight. Assuming his minutes stay north of the 20-minute mark, Diallo is a decent pickup for those in need of rebounds, blocks and FG%.

            E'Twaun Moore finished Wednesday's victory with 23 points on 10-of-15 shooting, making three 3-pointers with three rebounds, two steals and four turnovers in 34 minutes.
        
        
             It's the first time since Feb. 20 that Moore has scored at least 20 points in a game. It also appears to be the culmination of a recent upswing in his efficiency -- after a relative lull following the All-Star break, he's now connected on 8-of-13 triples over the past three games. He rarely contributes much more beyond scoring and a trickle of supporting stats, but is worth owning while he's hot.

            Rajon Rondo had six rebounds and six assists on Wednesday, but he shot just 1-of-6 from the field for two points in 29 minutes.
        
        
             In true Rondo fashion, he even passed up a wide-open layup tonight in favor of setting up a teammate. There were no 3-pointers or defensive stats to make up for the paltry offense, but this is what you get from the 12-year veteran. The good has easily outweighed the bad lately, so just keep him locked into your active lineups.

             Clark rarely contributes more than a dash of supporting stats, so when he's not scoring and hitting 3-pointers he's likely to leave owners wanting more. His role has expanded and he's still averaging 13.1 points on 55.9% FGs and 83.3% FTs over the past few weeks, with 0.9 triples, which is enough to hold him in most formats.

             He started the second half because of an injury to Giannis Antetokounmpo. In a halftime interview, assistant coach Stacey Augmon confirmed Parker would play ""a lot"" in the second half, and that he'd get a big opportunity to play more with the first unit. If Giannis is going to miss time, expect Parker to get more minutes and more chances to score. He gets a dream matchup in a hometown game in Chicago on Friday.

             His return bumped Solomon Hill from the starting lineup, but he was just a placeholder anyway. Holiday was playing without medical restrictions, according to coach Alvin Gentry, yet he needed an IV at halftime and was delayed to start the third quarter. He's tentatively safe to keep in active lineups, but it can't hurt to double-check his status with another game looming vs. the Lakers on Thursday.

            The Pacers lost their rescheduled game vs. New Orleans on Wednesday, despite Cory Joseph chipping in eight points, four rebounds, three steals and one block off the bench.
        
        
             Lance Stephenson said half-jokingly before the game that Indy was ""mad"" about losing an off-day due to the canceled game. ""We’re going to go whoop New Orleans,"" he added. Things didn't go to plan for Stephenson (five points in 13 minutes) and company, despite using their preferred starting five with Darren Collison at PG and Joseph off the bench. Indy has been going with a lot of small lineups and Joseph continues to get minutes in the mid-20s, which is enough for him to be a steals specialist.

""We were in the top-5 of [fewest] turnovers because of Darren handling the ball early and most of the season,"" he said. ""He does a good job of taking care of the ball."" The miscues won't become a trend and he's back to being a must-start fantasy guard.

             He hit a clutch trey and had some words for the Bucks bench in this big win. Besides his struggles at the line, Rivers has it going over his last five outings with 18.2 points, 3.2 boards, 2.6 dimes, 1.0 blocks, 1.4 steals and 2.6 treys. Danilo Gallinari (hand) is still out, so expect Rivers to continue to flirt with 20 points per game.

             The Nuggets had this in the bag at half with a season-high 77 points. It was Serbian Night at United Center with 527 tickets being sold to Serbian fans this evening, so they were pumped with the hot start. Jokic made his first seven shots from the field in a game the Nuggets absolutely had to have. Denver's schedule gets extremely difficult after this win with all of their games against teams over .500, including a four-game run at Washington, at Philly, at Toronto and at OKC that starts on Friday.

             This wasn't about the garbage time with 11 points in the first half. Harris has been decent over his last four, averaging 12.3 points, 2.0 boards, 4.5 assists, 0.5 steals and 1.8 treys. That may be a bit high for him going forward, but don't be surprised to see him flirt with that until Gary Harris (knee) gets back.

             He did most of his damage in the first half with four steals and 12 points. Millsap continues to shoot the ball much better in wins this year, but he's made just 38.8 percent from the field in losses compared to 51.4 percent in wins. He should be good for a little bit of everything as the Nuggets battle for the postseason.

""My ultimate goal is to return to Denver,"" Barton said. ""You know me, I’m a real loyal guy."" He'll finally get to choose where he wants to go as an unrestricted free agent, so that'll be something to watch this summer. Until then, he should be starting in all fantasy leagues, especially with Gary Harris (knee) out.

             The Nets led by 23 points in the third quarter tonight before simply collapsing, denying them their first three-game win streak of the season. Anyone who gambled on Harris left happy, though, as he connected on 4-of-9 shots without any turnovers in 24 minutes -- it's his best outing in recent memory, and the first time he's had multiple steals since Feb. 22. Given his lack of consistency for anything but 3-point shooting, most owners should view him skeptically.

             The playing time was there, and in true Crabbe fashion he still knocked down two 3-pointers -- he's now just one triple behind Deron Williams for the Nets' single-season record in made 3-pointers. He was coming off a 22-point game and is extremely hit-or-miss, but has enough upside to keep trotting out there in most formats.

             Before the game, coach Kenny Atkinson reiterated that he thinks Allen has hit the rookie wall physically this season. ""[Allen's] energy has been more sporadic [recently] and I think that’s just the grind of a 19-year-old player starting now,"" Atkinson said. ""It's the toll that this season takes."" Allen's effort tonight can't be faulted, but he was no match for Dwight Howard's physicality. He'll finish the week with matchups vs. the Raptors (Friday) and Cavaliers (Sunday).

             The moment to snag LeVert off the waiver wire came in late February, when he returned from an extended absence. He's cruising with minutes in the 24-30 range lately, and is one of just four first- or second-year players averaging 12.0+ points, 4.0+  assists, 3.0+ rebounds and 1.0+ steals, joining Ben Simmons, Kris Dunn and Dennis Smith Jr. Two of those guys are currently injured, of course, which makes LeVert even more appealing to owners who stuck with him.

             Charlotte finished their five-game road trip with a win in Brooklyn, but that won't change their trajectory toward the draft lottery. There's been no indication the Hornets will rest their veterans, but that doesn't mean it won't happen -- they might even want to limit Marvin based on merit alone, as he's making a miserable 37.3% FGs and 62.5% FTs in March.

His usage spikes as a PG when Kemba Walker is off the court, but his efficiency plummets -- it's a trade-off Charlotte will likely accept to develop his on-ball skills, especially since they're not making the postseason. Just keep an eye on him in standard leagues.

            Dwight Howard grabbed a career-high 30 rebounds vs. the Nets on Wednesday, while scoring 32 points (10-of-17 FGs, 12-of-21 FTs), but he also committed his 16th technical foul of the season.
        
        
             First, the good news. Howard set a Hornets franchise record for boards in a game and simply obliterated the Nets' frontcourt all night long, including 11 offensive rebounds. Jarrett Allen fouled out, Rondae Hollis-Jefferson fouled out, and Quincy Acy just wasn't big enough to keep Dwight off the glass. The bad news is that unless his technical foul is rescinded, he'll now face a mandatory one-game suspension -- Willy Hernangomez and Frank Kaminsky stand to benefit if Dwight does sit out, which would likely be vs. Memphis on Thursday.

             The minutes for Payne dropped in this game because the Bulls were basically done at half. Payne is going to struggle hitting shots, but he has upside for dimes, steals and three 3-pointers. If you're punting percentages, Payne should have value to you.

             It was Lamb's second straight start with Nicolas Batum (Achilles tendinitis) on the sidelines. Batum's return date is unclear and it depends on how he responds to treatment, which bodes well for Lamb -- Charlotte is 7.5 games out of the playoff picture and might as well keep Batum on the sidelines. Lamb has too much upside to leave unowned outside of shallow leagues.

             Cody Zeller (knee) has missed six consecutive games and the Hornets have no clear reason to bring him back, since they're now playing for the draft lottery. They seem content to give Dwight Howard and Frank Kaminsky heavy minutes for the moment, although Hernangomez could luck into a big role with Dwight looking at a possible suspension for getting 16 technicals.

             That's three straight productive games and the Bulls will likely continue to play him because of no Lauri Markkanen (back). In those three, he's averaged 14.3 points, 7.0 boards, 1.0 assists, 0.3 blocks, 0.7 steals and 2.3 turnovers on 73.1 percent from the field and 100 percent from the line. That works in most formats, so give him a look if you want to use him for a back-to-back set on Friday and Saturday.

            James Johnson scored three points with five rebounds, six assists, one steal and one block in 22 minutes against the Knicks on Wednesday.
        
        
             The Heat had this game well in hand and Johnson obviously gets a pass here after a big start to his March. Besides, that's a pretty solid line except for the low scoring. As long as Hassan Whiteside (hip) is out, Johnson is a guy you'll want to have in your lineup.

             Kelly Olynyk has been too good right now and the Heat didn't need to go with a double-big lineup against the Knicks. They probably won't need to on Friday against OKC, so Bam may not be worth holding even if Hassan Whiteside (hip) remains out.

            Ben Simmons helped Philly cruise to victory on Wednesday with 13 points on 6-of-9 shooting, nine assists, seven rebounds and two steals.
        
        
             Simmons did his damage in 25 minutes tonight and is simply an every-night threat for a triple-double. The Sixers have won 16 of their past 17 home games, which is all the more reason for them to fight for playoff position -- they're currently the No. 6 seed, with just 1.5 games separating them from the Wizards, Pacers and No. 3 seed Cavaliers. There's no reason to think Simmons will miss time as a precaution, therefore, which is music to his owners' ears.

             The Sixers have kept Embiid out during shootarounds and limited him on off-day practices, and coach Brett Brown ""anticipates"" resting him ""in one of the final 12 Sixers games."" Brown added that it might not happen during their current back-to-back, which improves his outlook for Thursday. He expected Embiid to push back against the decision, and sure enough, after tonight's game Embiid said, ""Well, I'm playing in every game. We didn't come this far to rest me."" Fantasy owners can only keep him active and hope for the best.

             Covington added two rebounds, one assist and one steal in an easy home win. He's really turned things around lately, especially in leagues that count FG percentages. The streaky shooter shot no better than 38.4% from the field in December, January and February, but he's up to 47.3% in March. With the addition of well-rounded stats (2.8 triples, 5.4 boards, 2.2 assists, 1.4 steals, 1.3 blocks), he's once again posting top-40 value in most formats.

             None of Philly's starters logged more than 25 minutes tonight due to the lopsided score. Marco Belinelli was playing well with 15 points in 32 minutes off the bench, and coach Brett Brown simply used the opportunity to rest the 33-year-old Redick. This was the first half of a back-to-back set, though, so at least he'll be rested vs. Orlando on Thursday.

             He finally found his shot after going just 6-of-19 from the field in his previous two games. Johnson's minutes have been hanging around 30 since Dwyane Wade went down, but coach Erik Spoelstra has a lot of options to close. Johnson is still probably worth owning, but he'll get a tougher matchup against the Thunder on Friday.

Ellington has clearly benefitted from Dwyane Wade missing time, averaging 15.2 points, 3.0 boards, 1.2 assists, 1.0 steals and 4.0 treys in those five games. He's a fine specialist and he's worth using in most leagues while he's getting 32.6 minutes per game.

             Toronto fell to 7-5 in the second of back-to-back games this season, which is surprising given their team depth. This loss snapped a nine-game road win streak and came despite an astounding 79-point first half tonight, their highest-scoring half all season. They'll look to vent against the Nets on Friday, and the only concern for JV's owners is that he went knee-to-knee with Kevin Love late in tonight's game. We're leaving him off the injury report, but it can't hurt to confirm his status.

             VanVleet played with a wrap around his hand but wasn't bothered by the injury -- it helped that the Cavs left him wide open throughout the first half. He could get a bump in minutes if the Raptors rest Kyle Lowry at some point down the stretch, which is worth remembering when they're confronted by back-to-back sets in April.

             Lowry went 6-of-9 from deep and didn't take a shot inside the arc through three quarters tonight. That's not shocking since he's taken 62.3% of his shot attempts from deep this season, but it's a mixed blessing -- in addition to 3.0 triples per game, he's shooting just 42.7% from the field overall.

Poeltl hadn't scored double-figure points since Mar. 11 but remains a sneaky roto option if you need FG% and defensive stats, with a dash of rebounds.

They're safely locked into the No. 1 seed and fantasy owners should prepare for at least a few more DNPs -- the Raptors play back-to-back sets on Apr. 3-4 and 8-9. Until then, at least, it should be safe to plug DeRozan back into active lineups.

            Michael Beasley scored 22 points during a 119-98 loss to the Heat on Wednesday, adding seven rebounds, three assists, one steal and two 3-pointers in 34 minutes.
        
        
             That's three 21-plus scoring games over his last five outings, averaging 18.4 points per game on 66.1 FG% in that span. Beasley's minutes continue to stay near 30 and he's starting to add more non-scoring stats to his line, too. He's arguably the best Knick to own in fantasy, which says a lot about where the Knicks are right now.

             The minutes finally went up after he played just 33 combined in the previous two games. Kanter is going to be a risky player some nights because of his back injury and how the Knicks likely want to move to the No. 7 spot in the lottery. Kanter should still be owned, but his fantasy owners may want to check he's good most nights.

            Kevin Love banged his right knee in the final seconds of Wednesday's game, but still finished with 23 points, 12 rebounds, four assists, one steal and four 3-pointers.
        
        
             Cavs' interim coach Larry Drew praised Love's play at both ends after his return on Monday. ""He was pretty active defensively,"" Drew said. ""Everybody knows when he’s out on the floor he’s capable of scoring baskets whether he’s inside or out."" We can't vouch for his defense tonight, but he went to work offensively with 8-of-15 FGs and 3-of-4 FTs, and is paying off for owners who kept him stashed. The knee injury didn't seem serious tonight, but we'll list him as questionable for Friday as a simple precaution.

             Hill added three rebounds, two steals and one block in 36 minutes, marking easily one of his best games since joining the Cavs in early February. The absence of Kyle Korver (personal) and Rodney Hood (back) opened up the rotation, and it helped that Toronto's defense was unusually lax, so we're not reading much into Hill's mini eruption.

             Korver is away from the Cavs indefinitely following the death of his brother, and Cleveland opted to shift George Hill to SG while keeping their second-unit rotation intact. We've already seen what Calderon looks like as a starter at age 36, and it's not inspiring -- in 26 previous starts, he averaged 5.6 points, 1.1 threes, 2.7 assists, 2.3 rebounds and 0.7 steals. Tonight's solid line aside, that's all owners can expect if Korver misses more time.

             LBJ went 11-of-19 from the field and 12-of-14 from the line tonight, and his brilliance helped carry the Cavs to a win vs. the East's top-seeded team. When asked before the game about Cleveland's playoff race and quest for another Finals appearance, James replied, ""What is know is I'll be available, so we've got a chance."" Fantasy owners can echo the sentiment, as he continues to pile up elite value without a single DNP all season.

             The Knicks continue to start him despite some poor play, but why wouldn't they? He had a -16.4 net rating in his time with the Knicks before today as the Knicks look to get more lottery balls. He has a chance for some counting stats, but his inefficiency will make it tough to own him in standard leagues.

             He gets ruled out even before the half starts. Antetokounmpo was able to walk to the locker room under his own power, but now it looks like he's the latest star to suffer a late-season injury. It'll be Jabari Parker and Shabazz Muhammad having to step up, but Muhammad isn't much of a fantasy add. Giannis finished with 12 points, two rebounds, two assists, one steal and three blocks in 17 minutes.

             The Bucks pulling a last-second switch is nothing new, so don't read too much into it. Terry can remain on the wire in most leagues.

             Jason Terry is replacing Snell in the starting lineup tonight. This shouldn't have a big impact on fantasy lineups since neither guy is producing value in standard leagues anyway, and Snell's minutes shouldn't take a huge hit with the second unit.

             This is a little bit of a surprise for Ibaka, who hasn't had a game off recently unlike Lowry and DeRozan. For now, plan on the Raptors giving their first unit decent work, but there's some risk in using them in DFS.

            General manager Ryan McDonough said it ""probably is unlikely"" Tyson Chandler (neck, shoulder) plays again this season.
        
        
             ""We never say never,"" McDonough said. The Suns have been quiet with Chandler lately, but there have been a lot of signs that Chandler was going to be shut down. Alan Williams (knee) is getting closer, so the team may just give him Chandler's minutes. Alex Len could have a couple more games after his big 19-12 line on Tuesday.

             While he'll play today, he won't be out there on Thursday night, which is an obvious move. Gasol should be somewhat busy tonight with Tyreke Evans not playing. Basically, any veteran Grizzlies player will be extremely annoying to own as they compete with the Suns for the No. 1 spot in the lottery.RotoGrinders.com Daily Slant: Gasol is definitely a viable upside play with Evans out, but his usage/FPPM numbers don't actually change much in that split - he gets a +2.2% usage boost and a +0.03 FPPM bump. However, Andrew Harrison gets a notable +4.3% usage bump and a team-leading +0.09 FPPM increase, and at his current salary he'd be a solid bet to pay it off assuming he receives normal minutes.

             He has chronic tendinitis and he's almost certainly going to miss more time after he was pulled from action on Saturday. Jeremy Lamb should be looking at 30 minutes while Dwayne Bacon has also earned more minutes. Lamb is worth owning and is a DFS play today.

With DeRozan back in action, Malcolm Miller will return to the second unit, and Kyle Lowry's usage will take a slight hit. Feel free to get him active.

Paul has dealt with several left hamstring strains over his career, so the Rockets would be wise to hold him out.

            C.J. Miles (gastroenteritis) is questionable to play against the Cavs on Wednesday.
        
        
             He did not play well on Tuesday, making 1-of-9 from the field for three points in 21 minutes. It wouldn't be a surprise to see Miles sit this one out, so check back in an hour or so. If he and DeMar DeRozan (thigh) are out, that would likely mean more minutes for Delon Wright, Norman Powell and Malcolm Miller.

             He did not practice today and being called doubtful is not a surprise. Simmons' fantasy owners probably shouldn't bother to wait for him to return to action, and he's a fairly easy drop candidate in daily leagues. It'll be Wes Iwundu, Shelvin Mack and Arron Afflalo getting some extra run.

             This is a new injury for Isaac as the rookie has struggled to stay healthy. He was looking great on defense with five steals and two blocks in 28 minutes on Tuesday, but obviously this news makes him more of a drop than an add. Khem Birch should go back to playing more PF while Mario Hezonja is headed for more burn at forward, too.

             He did not play on Tuesday in what proved to be a costly loss to the Hawks. Favors should be back in the starting lineup, which would likely push Jonas Jerebko back to single-digit minutes. This shouldn't affect Jae Crowder too much either.

             He did not play on Monday due to soreness in his hamstring, so maybe he can make it back for Thursday. On the other hand, the Kings probably won't be rushing him back as they look for lottery balls.

             He did not practice on Wednesday and he's been out since Saturday night. Booker is going to have to play with a splint upon his return, but he's had a tough time with it. He will almost certainly be a game-time call in the first game of a back-to-back set.

Josh Jackson and Troy Daniels will step up the most while we see more Shaq Harrison and Davon Reed get more run, too.

             He has been ruled out basically the rest of March, but the Warriors have little incentive to bring him back early. Durant's injury may have made him only day-to-day in other situations, but the team continues to talk about making sure they're close to 100 percent for the playoffs. With him out, Nick Young, Pat McCaw and Andre Iguodala will pick up most of the wing minutes.

             This certainly puts his status in doubt for Friday against the Hawks. After Monday's game, Green said the Warriors are likely to rest more ""here and there"" now that they're basically locked in for the No. 2 seed. We're expecting Green to sit Friday or Sunday, or perhaps both games. If he's out, that could mean more run for Kevon Looney and Jordan Bell.

            Brandon Ingram (groin) did not practice on Wednesday and has been ruled out for Thursday's game against the Pelicans.
        
        
             Ingram was slightly sore after ramping up his workload on Tuesday, and with the Lakers clearly out of the playoff hunt, there's no incentive to rush Ingram back to the court. After Thursday's game, Ingram will have just one more opportunity to play this week, and given that he'll likely have restrictions upon his return, owners in most leagues can go ahead and just cut him. Kyle Kuzma, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope and Julius Randle will continue to split his minutes.

            Jonathon Simmons (right wrist contusion) did not practice on Wednesday and is being listed as questionable for Thursday's game against the 76ers.
        
        
             Simmons sat out Tuesday's game, which resulted in Arron Afflalo drawing the start, but he didn't really do anything while he was out there. Simmons skipping Wednesday's practice isn't a great sign regarding his status for tomorrow's game, and if he's out again, it'll be Aaron Gordon and Nikola Vucevic running the show on offense with more minutes falling to Jonathan Isaac and Mario Hezonja. Check back for another update following Thursday morning's shootaround.

             This will be LaVine's third straight game on the sidelines, and he's guaranteed to miss at least one more with Chicago's next set of games being a Friday-Saturday back-to-back set. With a max of one game this week, and no guarantees he plays at all, LaVine is a cut-candidate in all leagues. Denzel Valentine should draw another start tonight, and there will be more minutes for guys like Antonio Blakeney and David Nwaba.

             This isn't all that surprising considering both these guys were limited to non-contact work on Tuesday, and this will be Markannen's fifth straight game on the sidelines due to the back issue. The Bulls have a Friday-Saturday back-to-back set coming up, so Markkanen figures to miss at least one of those games, giving him a max of one game played this week. He's a cut-candidate in most scenarios. Bobby Portis and Denzel Valentine will see some heavy usage tonight with Markkanen, LaVine and Kris Dunn (toe) all on the shelf.

""Obviously, there were high expectations coming here and I haven’t come close to meeting them. But in my head, it’s all health. I know if I’m healthy, I can play with the best of them."" Since signing his four-year, $94 million deal back in 2016, Parsons has appeared in just 77 of a possible 152 regular-season games due to knee issues. We're not expecting a sudden bounce-back next year.

             The best case scenario part of this quote implies that Harris may not make it back for next week's back-to-back set, although the Nuggets do have four games next week, so he is worth stashing if you're in a bye week or have an open IR-spot. In the meantime, it'll be Will Barton starting with Jamal Murray, Nikola Jokic and Paul Millsap being asked to do more on offense. For what it's worth, Malone did acknowledge that Harris still hasn't done a lot of running.

             The Pelicans are playing three games in three nights, so Hill will hit the sidelines for this one as he continues to work his way back into game shape following the hamstring tear. He's not a huge part of the rotation in New Orleans, so his absence will have a minimal impact in fantasy hoops.

If he is forced to spend another game on the sidelines, Ian Clark or DeAndre Liggins could move into the starting five, Rajon Rondo will have the ball in his hands more often and Anthony Davis will be more ridiculous than usual. Stay tuned.

With the Lakers currently going through a rebuild, and the 29-year-old IT2 seeking max-money in what will likely be his last big payday, it seems unlikely the two sides will be able to find a deal that makes both parties happy this summer.

Parker's name has come up in trade rumors in the past, and while it'll ultimately be Milwaukee's decision as to where Parker winds up as they'll have the ability to match any contract he signs on the open market, it sounds like they may be willing to let him walk if he receives a max-offer.

            Eric Gordon bounced back from a couple quiet games with 18 points, four rebounds and three 3-pointers in 34 minutes on Tuesday.
        
        
             He scored a total of 10 points in his previous two games, so it was nice to see him get back on track in this one. Ryan Anderson has become an afterthought in Houston, so look for Gordon to keep getting big minutes and to play well for the Rockets going forward.

             Chris Paul appeared to tweak his left hamstring in this one and if he's out on Thursday against the Pistons, Harden should have another monster game. Then again, he's likely to have another monster game regardless of who he's on the court with. Go ahead and give him the MVP Award now.

             He was very quiet tonight after double-doubling in his previous three games, and Jusuf Nurkic had his way in this one. Capela was hot coming in and will look to bounce back on Thursday against the Pistons. Andre Drummond gave it up to Alex Len tonight, so the odds are in Capela's favor to get back on track in that one.

             C.J. McCollum hit just 4-of-15 shots for eight points and also missed all five of his 3-pointers, so the fact the Blazers got 9-of-32 shooting (0-for-12 from downtown) from their two best players and nearly beat the best team in the league for their 14th win in a row is admirable. The Blazers are still two games ahead of the Thunder for the No. 3 spot in the West and came out of the game healthy, so they'll look to bounce back against the Celtics on Friday.

             Nurkic was awesome tonight and was able to stay on the floor despite being in foul trouble for most of the game. Clint Capela disappeared for the Rockets tonight and Nurk's domination was part of the reason why that happened. Nurkic has had his ups and downs this season, but has been a beast in March. He's a big reason why they won 13 straight games before losing tonight.

             He's officially cooking, scoring in double figures in four straight games, knocking down a bunch of 3-pointers and shooting it lights out (23-of-32 for 72%). Harkless isn't going to hurt you anywhere and is contributing in points, threes, steals, blocks and rebounds right now, not to mention field goal percentage. He's worth grabbing in hopes that he can somehow stay this hot going forward.

             It wasn't enough as the Rockets snapped the Blazers 13-game winning streak, but it was one of the best games Aminu has had in some time, if not ever. He really fell off in the last couple months, but is starting to turn it on again, scoring in double figures in four straight games, averaging 9.3 rebounds, 1.5 steals and 3.8 3-pointers over that stretch. Go get him.

             This was one of his best all-around games of the season, but that's not saying much. He is starting to gain some momentum in deeper leagues though, as he's played 24+ minutes in six out of his last seven games and has hit a combined seven triples in his last three outings. If the Pistons decide to give up on their playoff hunt, maybe they increase his responsibility.

             He stayed in, made a couple clutch free throws and told Dennis Scott that he was all right after the game, but he was clearly in pain and doing some limping right after the injury occurred, and also sat out the final inbounds play of the game. ""I'm cool, winning always makes everything feel better,"" said Paul when 3D asked him about the potential injury after the game. CP3 has had some groin and knee issues this season and it looks like you can add hamstring to the list. Hopefully he wakes up on Wednesday and feels good, but there's a chance this is an injury that could cost him some time. Keep an eye out for updates on Wednesday and Thursday.

             He was limited to 15 minutes as expected, but looked fine for the most part. Jackson did have a fall in the fourth quarter, but he didn't grab his ankle and he came out of this game without any setbacks. The Pistons will gradually increase his workload, so he's not a great pickup if you need to rely on him this week. Once he's cleared for 25+ minutes, that's when fantasy owners should consider grabbing him.

Ever since his 13-point dud against the Jazz, Griffin has been on an impressive run over his last four games, posting averages of 23.3 points, 8.3 assists, 7.5 rebounds, 0.5 blocks and 3.0 triples. The Pistons are six losses behind the No. 8 seed (Bucks), but Detroit has no choice but to make a push for the playoffs since they traded away their first-round pick. That's good news for Griffin's fantasy owners.

The Suns were probably hoping he would step up with both Devin Booker (hand) and T.J. Warren (knee) out, but that hasn't been the case. With the Suns off until Friday, Payton is a drop candidate if you're tired of waiting for him to come around.

             Len's minutes have been all over the place lately, but he's the only healthy center on the roster right now and the Suns needed his size against Andre Drummond. Len hit 9-of-11 shots and his only free throw, but it's hard to add a player that averaged 12.5 minutes in his previous March games. If you want to take a flier on him, give him a look for Phoenix's back-to-back set on Friday vs. Cleveland and Saturday vs. Orlando because Alan Williams (knee) won't make his debut until Monday at the earliest. Keep an eye out for any news on Tyson Chandler (neck, shoulder) though.

            Josh Jackson started against the Pistons on Tuesday and double-doubled with 15 points, 11 rebounds, two assists and one steal in 37 minutes.
        
        
             He started for T.J. Warren (knee), while Devin Booker (hand) also sat this one out. Jackson finished 6-of-19 from the field and 3-of-6 from the line, and his shot was blocked several times which is further evidence that he needs to work on his release this summer. If you can live with some inefficiency, Jackson is worth owning and is capable of putting up some big lines like we saw against the Warriors on Saturday -- he had 36 points, two triples, six boards, four assists, two steals and one block in that contest.

             He came into tonight's game hitting 45% of his triples, but only hit 1-of-8 attempts tonight and finished 4-of-11 from the field and 7-of-8 from the line. He's cruising with fifth-round value on a per-game basis in standard leagues and his fantasy owners can look forward to deploying him three more times this week.

             Lee started over Tyler Dorsey tonight and actually had several huge rebounds with the game on the line. And while management is in tank mode, the Hawks players badly wanted to win this game, and Lee played a solid role in making that happen. He also hit a clutch free throw and is making the most of his 10-day contract. He's not worth picking up in any leagues, but his story is of the feel-good variety.

             Mitchell hit all five of his free throws, but shot just 9-of-28 from the field and 1-of-10 from beyond the arc. The counting stats are still there, but Mitchell has gone cold from 3-point range, hitting just 23-of-84 (27.3%) attempts in March. He gets three more games this week against the Mavericks, Spurs and Warriors.

             Schroder had his way with Ricky Rubio (who also fared well with 23 points) and had a very efficient game. He missed some big free throws and made a foolish flagrant foul on Rubio late by poking him in the eye, but the Hawks only won this game because of what Schroder was able to do. He's scored in double figures in 10 straight games, but the tanking Hawks need to be careful, as they accidentally tied the Magic tonight for the worst record in the East with the win.

             Dedmon battled Rudy Gobert to a push tonight, which was most impressive. Dedmon had some extra room to work with John Collins out with an ankle injury and responded with one of his better offensive games of the season, as well as his season high in boards. He had 10 points and eight rebounds in his previous game and will look to stay hot against Willie Cauley-Stein and the Kings on Thursday. If you picked Dedmon up before tonight's game, congratulations on a great call.

             He missed all four of his shots and didn't see the floor much with the Jazz opting to go small. Even if Favors misses additional time, Jerebko is safe to leave on the waiver wire.

             Prince did hit 5-of-5 free throws and four of those were clutch with the game on the line, but for fantasy owners looking for another 20- or 30-point explosion, Prince didn't answer the call tonight. Look for him to bounce back on Thursday against the Kings, as he'll look to start at new 3-point streak, as he didn't hit one for the first time in 12 games. He'd actually hit 20 3-pointers over his previous four games before tonight's dud.

             The win snapped the No. 8 Jazz's nine-game winning streak and leaves them clinging to playoff life with a two-game lead over the No. 9 Nuggets in the West. Muskie was solid, but once Collins returns he'll go back to being a somewhat risky fantasy play on a nightly basis. Muscala is averaging 10.2 points, 5.8 rebounds, 0.8 steals, 1.0 blocks and 2.0 3-pointers over his last five though, so we were expecting a little more tonight.

You can probably find a better player off the waiver wire.

             This came out of nowhere, as SKP had logged a total of 18 minutes as a Clipper prior to this outburst. We'll obviously need to see him do this again, but it's possible he chips away at Sindarius Thornwell's workload.

             Al Horford's been pretty bad in his last two games and Monroe has scored in double figures in four straight, playing at a pretty high level off the bench. The Celtics have two more games this week and play three games next week, meaning Monroe deserves a fantasy look if you need a center.

             Kyrie Irving (knee) may not play again in March and Rozier is clearly the guy you want to own right now. He hit a huge 3-pointer, followed by a pair of Carmelo Anthony misses at the line, and then Marcus Morris won the game with a contested 3-pointer of his own. Rozier has scored in double figures in every game he's played since January 31, and is as must-start as they come as long as Irving is out.

             That's back-to-back 23-point games for Tatum, who's averaging 18.4 points and 6.8 boards over his last five. He's catching fire at the right time of the season so make sure he's in your lineup every time the Celtics are playing. They're locked into the No. 2 seed in the East, but Tatum's young enough that he should be immune to resting if the Celtics decide to give some guys a night off down the stretch.

             Rivers is a high-volume shooter, so when he's off he can do a lot more harm than good for his fantasy owners. He added just one rebound, one assist, one steal, one block and two triples in 35 minutes, but he will have three more chances to redeem himself this week and he's been pretty solid in March for the most part.

             The Celtics snapped the Thunder's six-game winning streak tonight thanks to a Marcus Morris 3-pointer for the win, and were helped by a pair of Carmelo Anthony missed free throws, as well as Westbrook's final shot being off the mark. The Thunder are still holding down the No. 4 seed in the West, but are just 1.5 games from being in the No. 8 seed. Westbrook is going to continue to put the team on his back and try to carry them, but Morris' huge shot was too much to overcome tonight. Paul George chipped in with 24 points and 13 boards, Steven Adams added 14 points and seven boards, and Carmelo Anthony had 13 points and a couple big misses at the line.

             He missed a couple free throws with the game close late, but also hit a big 3-pointer to put the Mavericks away tonight. This was a nice revenge game for Rondo, who also had 11 assists on Sunday. The Pelicans are in must-win mode and Rondo is averaging 10.3 points, 5.5 rebounds, 11.8 assists and 2.8 steals over his last four games. Make sure he's in your lineup.

             He started, but wasn't used against the mostly center-less Mavs tonight, after playing just 12 minutes on Thursday. He was playing well before these two duds and should be ready to bounce back soon, but is pretty unreliable, obviously. But after playing just 17 minutes since Thursday, he should have plenty of energy if the Pelicans decide to use him more going forward.

             Moore missed a pair of big free throws late in the game, but the Pelicans hung on for the win. He's quietly scored in double digits in six straight games and in eight of his last nine, making him worth a look in deep leagues by desperate fantasy owners.

             He was iffy to play in the second half after suffering a lower leg injury, but he was back out there doing work in the second half.

Just check back to make sure he's good to go against the Pacers on Wednesday.

             He was given a day off on Saturday but was back out there tonight. The Mavs have nothing to play for, so fantasy owners will want to make sure Barnes is a go each time the Mavs play the rest of the way.

             While Yogi would be more fun to own if he was guaranteed to start every night, he was fine tonight and has scored in double figures in four straight games, averaging 12.3 points, 2.5 rebounds, 4.3 assists, 0.8 steals and 1.3 3-pointers over that stretch. As long as Dennis Smith Jr. is out with his sprained ankle, both Ferrell and J.J. Barea, who started tonight, are worth using in fantasy.

             He didn't play on Saturday, but is kind of hot after going for six points, six boards, three assists, five steals and three blocks on Friday. If you're in a pinch at center and need a risky player with some upside, Noel fits the bill.

             He missed his last game with a rib injury, but started for the injured Dennis Smith Jr. (ankle) and also got the nod over Yogi Ferrell tonight. Ferrell was better from a scoring standpoint (15) but JJB bested him in assists. Ferrell still seems like the guy to own while DSJ is out, but if Barea's going to start, he's also worth a look in fantasy.

             There it is! We've been waiting for Isaac to break out and while he's flirted with some nice lines, this is the first time he's really put it all together. If you picked him up to play him this week, well done. And if he's still sitting on your waiver wire, it makes sense to grab him. Frank Vogel will likely play Isaac and Aaron Gordon alongside each other a lot the rest of the way in order to see what he's got, as he envisions the duo being an elite defensive tandem for the Magic next season.

             He'd missed five straight games with his concussion and spent a lot of time playing alongside Jonathan Isaac tonight, and Isaac was also sharp with 10 points, five rebounds, five steals, two blocks and two 3-pointers. Coach Frank Vogel said after the game he envisions the duo playing alongside each other and being elite defensively in the future, but maybe the future is now.

             DeMar DeRozan sat this one out and Kyle Lowry went off, but only Serge Ibaka, Wright and Norman Powell managed to join Lowry in double-digit scoring. Fred VanVleet was out again with his hand injury and as long as that's the case, Wright looks like a solid fantasy option in most leagues.

             He hit eight 3-pointers in a game in November and hit seven in another game earlier this month. Lowry's been crazy good over his last two, averaging 23.5 points, 4.5 rebounds, 9.0 assists and 6.0 3-pointers. The Raptors gave DeMar DeRozan the night off and used their bench heavily, but Lowry was able to step up and post a monster line. Hopefully he doesn't have a day off in his near future.

             He was supposed to be a game-time call, but he didn't even come out for warmups. That's not a great sign and it doesn't help that the Suns have no incentive to throw him out there at less than 100 percent. His next chance to play will be on Friday vs. the Cavaliers. Troy Daniels is worth a look for his 3-point shooting, but Josh Jackson is the biggest winner and is coming off a monster game.

The Pelicans are calling him questionable to return with a ""lower leg injury,"" so expect them to run some tests like they usually do when he leaves games. If he can't return, be prepared to add Cheick Diallo.

             As expected, he's going to have heavy restrictions right out of the gate and it could be a while before they are completely lifted. If you do pick him up, expectations should be very low for the first week or so. Ish Smith will return to the bench, but he'll hold most of his value until Jackson's cleared for 24+ minutes.

             The Spurs continue to rule him out well in advance of games. With just 10 regular-season games left, Leonard is quickly running out of time to return. At this point, he's only worth stashing if you have an I.R. spot.

             Hood has missed four of the past five games with this back issue, but we'll have a better idea on his status following Wednesday morning's shootaround. He'll likely be eased into things if he is able to get back out there on Wednesday night, so he's not really worth owning anywhere.

             Thomas has been sidelined since initially injuring his ankle back on March 3rd. Thus, being tagged as questionable is considered an upgrade. We should expect an update on his status following Wednesday morning's shootaround. Thompson has been a rebound specialist when healthy, but he will very likely be on a minutes limit as he works his way back into game shape. He will also have to split time with Larry Nance, once Nance (hamstring) returns from injury as well.

Joining Miller in the starting five will be Kyle Lowry, OG Anunoby, Serge Ibaka and Jonas Valanciunas. Lowry looks like a very attractive DFS target tonight. Miller hasn't done much of anything in his previous starts this season, so he's not worth deploying in most settings.

He was deemed a game-time decision by coach Frank Vogel earlier in the evening but was ruled out about 30 minutes prior to tipoff. Arron Afflalo will replace Simmons in the starting lineup.

             Irving will not play Tuesday, and appears to be headed for another four games on the sidelines, meaning his earliest possible return date will be March 31. He's a cut-candidate in most head-to-head leagues. Terry Rozier, Jayson Tatum and Al Horford will all be picking up the slack in his absence, and with Marcus Smart (thumb) also out, Shane Larkin will see an increased role in the rotation. Rozier is the PG you want to own, though. For what it's worth, Adrian Wojnarowski reports that there is no structural damage in Irving's knee, and the belief is that prolonged rest will ultimately be the best remedy.

Per nbawowy.com, when DeMarcus Cousins (Achilles) and Jrue Holiday have been off the floor this season, Anthony Davis' usage rate spikes to 40.0, so he's obviously going to be insanely busy tonight and is almost a required play in DFS. The Pelicans play again on Wednesday vs. the Pacers, and for now, we'll consider Jrue questionable for that one.

            Coach Frank Vogel said that Jonathon Simmons (right wrist contusion) will be a game-time decision for Tuesday's matchup vs. Toronto.
        
        
             Simmons bruised his right wrist in practice on Monday and was listed as questionable for this contest. The Magic game tips off at 7:00 pm, so we should have confirmation, one way or the other, prior to roster locks in DFS. If Simmons is ruled out, Mario Hezonja and Jonathan Isaac would likely soak up extra minutes. Orlando is welcoming back Aaron Gordon (concussion) to the lineup on Tuesday.

             This is Irving's surgically repaired knee, and he reportedly needs to have the screws removed, as they've been the cause of the recent flare-ups. Irving can either play through the pain or undergo a procedure to have the screws removed, which would cost him time on the sidelines. It's unclear how long the surgery would sideline him for, but he's reportedly scheduled for a consultation tomorrow, so we should know more soon. Terry Rozier is absolutely must-own in all leagues.

             Curry has spent the past six games on the sidelines, but if he gets in a full practice tomorrow, there's a chance he'll be able to get back out there for Friday's game against the Hawks. Curry may be eased back into things, but Quinn Cook's value will take a fairly large hit once Curry is fully up to speed. If not Friday, it sounds like Curry will be back by Sunday at the latest.

             Mudiay left Monday's win over the Hornets in the second half after spraining his right ankle, which has been an issue since before he was drafted. However, it appears he will remain in the lineup on Wednesday. Mudiay has appeared in 15 games for the Knicks, but has not been able to get into an offensive rhythm. He is shooting just 36.8 percent from the floor and 19.4 percent from downtown.

If he's out, Troy Daniels would likely draw the start with Josh Jackson doing the heavy lifting on offense. Daniels would be someone to think about as a 3-point streamer, while Jackson will be a popular DFS play. Stay tuned.

Warren's next opportunity to play will come Friday vs. Cleveland, but with that being the first of a back-to-back, he could sit again.

When asked about resting one of his guys, Casey said: ""Yeah, we may do that. It's something we'll look at."" Casey also added they'd prefer to rest guys now than right before the playoffs, so they don't lose their rhythm. Kyle Lowry was rested last week, which makes DeMar DeRozan and/or Serge Ibaka likely candidates if Casey decides to go that route.

             Despite the Cavs downplaying the severity of his injury after it initially happened last week, Nance has been sidelined for each of the Cavs past three contests. In addition, with Kevin Love (hand) now back in the mix, Nance will see fewer minutes even when he is fully healthy and returns to the lineup. There are likely more attractive options on the waiver wire if you are in the midst of the fantasy playoffs and need immediate help.

             This is certainly not surprising news, as Dunn is now in a walking boot after it was reported on Monday that he had suffered a setback while rehabbing his toe injury. Unfortunately, it's tough to be optimistic about Dunn's fantasy value going forward. After Wednesday, the Bulls will have just 11 games remaining on their schedule. And they have been blatantly tanking since the All-Star break. Thus, they obviously won't rush Dunn back until he is 100 percent healthy. Cameron Payne will continue to draw starts at PG.

             Zeller has missed each of the Hornets past five games, but the questionable tag represents an upgrade in his probability of a return for Wednesday. However, Zeller only has a minimal fantasy impact even when he's fully healthy. He should be left on waivers.

             Finney-Smith appeared in two games last week, logging over 20 minutes in each contest. However, he was rested on Saturday, which was the second night of a back-to-back for Dallas. He's appeared in just three games for Dallas this season, and has limited fantasy value moving forward. He should be left on waivers in all standard-sized leagues.

             Barea was able to play through discomfort last Friday, but then was ruled out of Saturday's game vs. Brooklyn. Dennis Smith Jr. (ankle) has already been ruled out of Tuesday's contest, so Barea will likely see all the minutes he can handle this evening. Yogi Ferrell and Kyle Collinsworth will soak up additional minutes if Barea is limited or is unable able to finish the game.

             Harris, who is dealing with the flu, was unable to participate in shootaround, as he was at the team hotel resting. If Harris is ruled out Tuesday evening, he will likely be replaced in the starting lineup by either Montrezl Harrell or Wes Johnson. Harrell would be a very intriguing DFS option in this scenario, as he's been very productive on a per-minute basis this season. Harrell is averaging 23.3 points, 8.8 rebounds and 1.6 blocks per-36 minutes for the Clippers.

             It's somewhat surprising that Green didn't receive a suspension, as he clearly shoved Dieng into the front row of spectators, after Dieng fouled Chris Paul. Green has scored at least 12 points in each of the last three games he's appeared in; but also has a pair of DNP-CDs sprinkled in there as well.

            Coach Frank Vogel said that Aaron Gordon (concussion) will start Tuesday vs. the Raptors.
        
        
             We knew Gordon had been cleared and would return to action vs. Toronto. Now we have confirmation that Gordon will be in the starting lineup after missing Orlando's previous five contests. We still don't have word on any minutes restrictions. Mario Hezonja and Jonathan Isaac will see their playing time reduced with Gordon back in the mix.

             Smart suffered a complete tear of the ulnar collateral ligament in his right shooting hand back on March 10th. He underwent successful surgery last Friday and was given a target timetable of 6-8 weeks. However, Smart believes he'll be back sooner. ""I am confident [I'll be back for the playoffs],"" Smart said Monday night. ""I had one of the top [hand] doctors do it. The surgery was a success. Like she told me, you might as well go on and get it now. The quicker you can get it, the quicker the recovery.""

             Green took a knee to the midsection in the first half of Friday's loss to the Spurs. He went to the locker room and was later ruled out of the game. However, Green downplayed the injury afterward. ""It'll be fine,"" said Green. ""I think it's just kind of something that's kind of at the peak right now, but it's calmed down a little bit since it happened. So, it's not that serious."" The Warriors don't play again until Friday, and it seems he plans to play in that contest.

Young is the first player in college basketball history to lead the NCAA in both categories. He is projected to be a top-10 pick in June's draft, likely falling in the 7-10 range. Depending on where he lands, Young is capable of being a fantasy asset his rookie season in the NBA.

             VanVleet did not play Sunday vs. OKC, but the Raptors have downplayed the seriousness of the injury. However, the Raps play a back-to-back on Tuesday and Wednesday, so they may hold him out for the front end. We should have an update after shootaround. If VanVleet is ruled out, Delon Wright will soak up additional minutes.

His right ankle will be officially re-evaluated on Tuesday and if all goes well, Curry will have two full days of practice and a shootaround before Friday's game. Watch for updates prior to the Hawks game.

             His foot injury appears to be behind him and this was a far better showing than this 1-of-8 shooting effort for four points against the Lakers on Friday. He was clearly helped by the two extra periods of play, but Richardson has been filling up the stat sheet all season. Hopefully he keeps it going against the Knicks on Wednesday. If he was dropped in your league, think about grabbing him, as the Heat have three more games this week.

It's not a surprise to see Murray step up even more with Gary Harris (knee) on the shelf, as he gets a 3.6 usage rate bump with Harris off the court. He gets a cupcake matchup vs. the Bulls on Wednesday as they will be without Kris Dunn (toe) and maybe Zach LaVine (knee).

Barton was disappointing in his last game with eight points on 3-of-12 shots vs. Memphis, but owners can expect increased production with Gary Harris (knee) expected to miss at least the remainder of this week. He's also been a huge surprise in the blocks category lately with six swatted shots in his last three games.

             This was just a brutal loss for the Nuggets, as they slide to 10th in the Western Conference standings. They are still just two losses behind the No. 8 seed (Minnesota) and three losses behind the No. 7 seed (New Orleans), and the good news is that this means Jokic will be locked and loaded as a first-round player for the duration of the fantasy playoffs. He finished 12-of-21 from the field and 6-of-6 from the line, adding 14 rebounds, three assists, four triples and four turnovers.

             Johnson looked like a dead man walking just five games ago, and was dropped in many leagues as a result. However, he woke up just in time for the fantasy playoffs, and if you were able to add him, you're probably doing very well right now. Johnson is averaging 17.8 points, 7.2 rebounds, 5.4 assists, 1.4 steals, 0.6 blocks and 1.7 3-pointers on 67 percent shooting over his last five. Whether you hung onto him through the rough seas or picked him up recently, Johnson might be ready to lead owners to a championship in the next couple weeks.

He finished 13-of-22 from the field and 7-of-7 from the line, adding 12 rebounds, one assist, one steal and two blocks. LMA has been rested a good bit since February, but he's still crushing his ADP for his fantasy owners and now has six games this season with 30+ points and 10+ rebounds -- that's the most by a Spur since Tim Duncan had six in 2004-05.

He started on Saturday and while he hasn't exactly been killing it, Labissiere still has a chance to finish the season on a tear, especially if the Kings stop playing Randolph, who had just four points in 15 minutes tonight.

             Not his best line, but the shooting was stellar and he came through with a nice showing for his playoff owners. Especially when you consider he had just six points, one rebound and two assists on Friday. He's got a great opportunity for a big game on Thursday against the Hawks.

             He was second on the Warriors in minutes played with 38 and continues to step up for a team that has injuries to all four of their superstars. Stephen Curry (ankle) is going to be re-evaluated before Friday's game vs. Atlanta, but if he misses more time Cook has proved to be a solid fantasy asset. Over his last three starts, Cook is averaging 24.3 points, 4.0 assists, 4.3 rebounds, 1.7 steals and 4.0 triples with 38 or more minutes in each. Not bad for a player with a two-way contract.

Iggy hasn't been anything special in his last three games since Kevin Durant (ribs, rest) went down, averaging 10.6 points, 4.7 rebounds, 2.7 assists, 0.7 steals and 1.0 triples.

             The Warriors seem content to spread the frontcourt minutes to five or six different players, limiting the upside of each. Green's injury isn't serious and the Warriors have three days off, so there are no immediate fantasy pickups. If Green can't go vs. the Hawks on Friday, Bell and Kevon Looney will be on the radar as streaming options.

Draymond Green also went down with a pelvic contusion tonight, so his status for Friday's game vs. the Hawks is up in the air.

            Zaza Pachulia played through a bruised right shoulder on Monday vs. the Spurs, scoring six points with three rebounds and one turnover in 14 minutes.
        
        
             Even with Draymond Green (pelvic contusion) leaving the game early, Pachulia didn't play much as expected. The Warriors are using several bigs in their rotation including JaVale McGee, David West, Jordan Bell and Kevon Looney, so Pachulia likely isn't going to emerge as a fantasy contributor down the stretch.

            Frank Ntilikina scored eight points with five assists, three rebounds, one steal and two triples in 24 minutes vs. the Bulls on Monday.
        
        
             As bad as the Knicks have been this season, they have the 11th ranked defense when Ntilikina is on the floor. He's starting to play better and is coming off a career-high 15-point game with three rebounds, three assists and a blocked shot. You still can't trust him in a standard league, especially in the fantasy playoffs, but his value is trending in the right direction.

            Michael Beasley scored 17 points with six rebounds, two assists, one steal and two 3-pointers vs. the Bulls on Monday.
        
        
             The Knicks took care of business early in this one, so Beasley played just 23 minutes and hit 6-of-10 shots and 3-of-3 free throws. Outside of Tim Hardaway Jr. and Enes Kanter, Beasley is really the only other Knick you can rely on in standard leagues. He's played well in four out of his last five games, averaging 16.0 points, 8.0 rebounds, 2.6 assists and 0.6 triples in that span. The Knicks also play three more times this week.

             That makes eight straight games of double digits from LeVert and it was nice to see him, Rondae Hollis-Jefferson and Allen Crabbe all have big games on the same night. All three players should be in fantasy playoff lineups right now.

            Courtney Lee returned from a one-game absence on Monday vs. the Bulls, scoring four points with two assists, one rebound and one block in 22 minutes.
        
        
             We're not sure why he was away from the team on Saturday, but it was an excused absence and hopefully everything is OK. Lee was a solid fantasy asset earlier this season, but the Knicks are going to play their younger guys like Frank Ntilikina more at the expense of Lee in the final few weeks. You should be able to find a better option than Lee on your waiver wire.

            Allen Crabbe returned from an illness and hit 7-of-10 shots and four 3-pointers for 22 points, three rebounds, two assists and a block, and also hit 4-of-4 free throws in 27 minutes of Monday's 118-115 win over the Grizzlies.
        
        
             Crabbe had missed his last two games with the illness, but looked great tonight. If he's available in your league, give him a look, as the Nets have three more games this week and Crabbe is back in the starting lineup.

             He had a big opportunity with Marc Gasol out with an illness, but didn't do much against the Grizzlies in this one. He'd blocked six shots in his previous two games, but is still just averaging 6.3 points, 6.0 rebounds and 1.8 blocks over his last four games.

             Apart from Cristiano Felicio, the other four starters for Chicago shot a combined 7-of-37 from the field. Needless to say, there aren't many takeaways from this game. Valentine added three rebounds, two assists and one block in 22 minutes, and he will have three more chances to redeem himself this week and the opportunity will be there with both Kris Dunn (toe) and Zach LaVine (knee) banged up.

He had 16 points, three boards, one assist, a steal, a block and four 3-pointers on Saturday, but will only be worth using if Evans continues to sit for the tanking Grizzlies. Unfortunately, there are not a lot of sure bets in Memphis right now, as the NBA enters the peak of its silly season.

             He was already ruled out for the remainder of Monday's game prior to this report. X-rays came back negative, but like we've seen the Warriors do with their other stars, they will be extra cautious. For now, Green should be considered questionable for Friday's game vs. the Hawks. Jordan Bell started the second half and would be in line for more run along with Kevon Looney if Green misses time.

             Tyreke Evans was a late scratch, apparently for tanking reasons, and Andrew Harrison was back from a nine-game absence tonight after recovering from a wrist injury. Both Harrison and Weber played well, and both should continue to see heavy minutes for as long as Evans is out. Weber is a speculative add in fantasy leagues, but only if you have some dead weight to drop.

             He'd missed his last nine games due to the wrist injury and Tyreke Evans sat out tonight for the tankers, and Harrison made the most of his opportunity. Maybe he'll continue to start and play well, just like he was before the injury. If he's available and you need a healthy body, Harrison is worth a look, but it will all depend on how much the Grizzlies want to play him after an extended injury absence, and he may not play as well as he did tonight on nights when Evans is on the floor.

             We know Blakeney can score, as he leads the G-League in points per game this season. This is a great chance for the Bulls to take an extended look at him, as Zach LaVine is day-to-day with knee soreness and Kris Dunn (toe) is in a walking boot. Coach Fred Hoiberg has kept his word about finding minutes for Blakeney and his scoring has translated to the NBA level with averages of 11.2 points, 1.8 rebounds, 2.0 assists, 1.0 steals and 1.0 triples in 23.4 minutes over his last five games. With three more games this week, Blakeney is an option for deep-league owners.

            Deyonta Davis started for Marc Gasol (illness) and hit 1-of-2 shots for two points, five rebounds and two assists in 22 minutes of Monday's loss to the Nets.
        
        
             Davis is always intriguing, especially when Gasol is out, but hasn't really been able to get it done this season. Gasol will likely continue to play for the Grizzlies when he's not sick, so Davis isn't someone you should be holding onto too tightly, if at all. Especially since the ""blocks specialist"" hasn't had one in six straight games.

             He'd been playing pretty well coming into this one but couldn't keep his hands to himself tonight. If you picked him up, he could easily bounce back on Wednesday against the Sixers.

             Robin Lopez has been benched for two straight games for tanking reasons, and the Bulls continue to list Lauri Markkanen as ""day-to-day."" There are probably better options on your waiver wire, but Vonleh could have some low-end value in deeper leagues until Markkanen comes back. In his previous two games, Vonleh averaged 7.5 points, 8.5 rebounds and 1.5 assists in 29.9 minutes.

             The Cavs say Rodney Hood (back) will start at shooting guard once he's healthy, but for now, Korver is the guy starting for Cleveland. Kover's been playing well with Hood injured, averaging 16.3 points, 4.0 rebounds and 3.8 3-pointers over his last four games played, but the return of Kevin Love tonight likely limited his offensive touches.

             It could be a groin or an oblique injury, but either way, he was clearly in pain and this does not sound like a promising injury. Green failed to score tonight, missing all four of his shots, and guys like David West, Kevon Looney and Jordan Bell should all step up in his absence. We'd rank them as Looney, Bell and West, if you're looking for the player to pick up in case Green's going to be facing an extended absence.

             This was one of the ugliest games of the season with the Bulls hitting 33-of-92 shots and 3-of-30 from 3-point range, but that's what you can expect in a tank bowl. Payne missed all five of his 3-pointers and turned the ball over a couple times, but he's coming off a great game on Saturday with 13 points and a career-high 10 assists. He deserves another chance if you picked him up, as Kris Dunn (toe) is in a walking boot and the Bulls have three more games this week.

             Hill has been pretty bad and is averaging just 7.0 points, 3.2 rebounds, 2.6 assists, a steal and a 1.2 3-pointers on 39 percent shooting over his last five. And with LeBron James, Kevin Love and Jeff Green doing the heavy lifting on offense for the Cavs, Hill is not a great fantasy option right now.

             Nice! If you were recently able to pick him up, congratulations are in order, as he originally wasn't expected back until March 23. And the Cavaliers need him with Larry Nance's hamstring injury, as well as Tristan Thompson's ankle injury.

             Green had 21 points in 43 minutes on Saturday, but wasn't needed as much on offense tonight with Kevin Love back in action for the Cavaliers. They're banged up enough, though, that Green should continue to get big minutes down the stretch for the Cavs and he should be in line for three more solid fantasy lines this week.

The Cavs have won three of their last four and LeBron is averaging 32 points, 12.2 rebounds, 9.2 assists, 1.8 steals, 1.8 blocks and 1.8 3-pointers over his last five, and the Cavs now sit as the No. 3 seed in the East, a 1/2 game ahead of the Pacers. The Cavs want home-court advantage in the first round of the playoffs, so LeBron, who is the No. 6 player in fantasy, should continue to play in most games down the stretch in order to keep up with the Jones'.

With three more games this week, there's no reason why Lamb should be available on your wire.

Middleton's returning third-round fantasy value on the season and is a must-start player down the stretch.

             He scored all 17 of his points in the first half before disappearing in the second. Not even a week ago, Hernangomez was blasted by coach Steve Clifford for his lack of shooting and defense, but it looks like the second-year center is finally getting a chance to prove himself while Cody Zeller (knee) is out and coach Clifford finally had some nice things to say about him at the morning shootaround. He played 13 minutes in his previous game with nine points and six rebounds, so deep-league owners should monitor him in case his role continues to grow.

             The Lakers have now lost three straight games and Ball's shooting is still a big concern, as he's shooting just 23 percent over his last five games. He's averaging 6.2 points, 5.6 rebounds, 8.4 assists, 2.2 steals, 0.8 blocks and 1.0 3-pointers, but the poor shooting is making it hard to see the good things he's doing in his stat lines. He's healthy and should finish out the season for the Lakers, but fantasy owners will have to weigh the field goal percentage damage that he'll do when considering playing him on a nightly basis.

             We're not sure why it took Luke Walton all season to figure out that Lopez is a nice offensive weapon, but he's been crushing it in March, and is averaging 20 points, 5.8 rebounds, 2.2 assists, 2.4 blocks and 2.4 3-pointers on 55 percent shooting over his last five games. If you recently picked him up, he might help you win a fantasy championship this year after a lost season for the first four months of the schedule.

             He's scored at least 21 points in five straight games and is averaging a ridiculous 26 points, 11.6 rebounds, 3.2 assists and is shooting 63 percent from the field over his last five games. And it's nice to see him, Kyle Kuzma and Brook Lopez all flourishing together for the Lakers.

             He played down the stretch and had eight of his 21 points in the fourth quarter. Belinelli also added a pair of assists and rebounds and did all of his damage in 24 minutes. Belinelli is consistently getting minutes in the 20s, but this was his best game as a 76er and we'll need to see him string a few more good games together before calling him a pickup in the middle of the fantasy playoffs. Prior to Monday, he was averaging just 10.5 points, 1.4 rebounds, 0.9 assists and 1.4 triples with the 76ers.

             Kuzma's ankle is clearly fine and this was his highest scoring game since he had 28 points on Jan. 23 against Boston. He missed a game with the ankle injury, but appears to be set to finish on a high note, averaging 19.5 points, 9.8 rebounds, 2.0 assists and 2.8 3-pointers in his last four games. He also bounced back nicely after scoring just 11 points on Friday against the Heat and should be in starting lineups until further notice.

             His nine triple-doubles are the most by a 76er since Wilt Chamberlain posted 31 in 1967-68. Simmons also racked up three steals on the night and this was his fourth straight point-assist double-double, the longest streak by a rookie since Darren Collison in 2010. The 76ers are in sixth place in the East, have won three straight and have one of the easiest remaining schedules in the league. Life is good for Philly fans these days.

             The Process hit 10-of-17 shots and 4-of-6 free throws with two assists, four triples and four blocks, but he was a little careless with the ball as he racked up a career-high nine turnovers. He attempted six triples on the night which is what coach Brett Brown asked him to do recently, and he made his 100th career triple in this game which makes him one of 10 7-footers in the NBA with at least 100 treys over the past two seasons.

The fantasy playoffs will almost be over at that point, but if your league runs through April, Hart could have some low-end value because he was playing really well before the injury.

             Collins suffered the injury during Saturday's game, and it's not a great sign that he's being ruled out a full 24 hours in advance. The Hawks do have four games this week, but with two of them being a Thursday-Friday back-to-back set, Collins might only be available for two of those four games. He was playing well prior to going down, but with him out until at least Thursday, he's a cut-candidate in standard leagues. Mike Muscala and Dewayne Dedmon will benefit in his absence.

             The Bulls are officially listing Dunn as day-to-day, but in Chicago speak, that could really mean week-to-week. There's zero incentive to rush Dunn back to the court and risk another setback, so expect them to be extremely cautious bringing him along. Cameron Payne will be starting in his absence, and after posting a 13-point, 10-dime double-double on Saturday, he's someone to consider swooping up in deep leagues. Dunn, unfortunately, is a cut candidate.

             The Bulls are going to be shorthanded again, so we'd expect Vonleh to get a decent chunk of minutes off the bench. In his last two games before the injury, he averaged 7.5 points, 8.5 rebounds and 1.5 assists in 29.9 minutes. There should be better streaming options on your wire.

             Harrison hasn't played since February 28, so he could be somewhat limited tonight, making him a risky DFS target. He was, however, playing well prior to going down, and his upside is considerably higher with Tyreke Evans sitting out tonight and maybe longer. Harrison is worth a look if you need a PG.

             He was a game-time call, but there's no word of any restrictions. The Cavaliers may not have that luxury because they are very shorthanded. If you need to stream 3-pointers, Korver is definitely a solid option and the Cavaliers play four times this week.

             If the Grizzlies were battling for a playoff spot you can bet that Gasol would have gutted it out, but there's just zero incentive for him to play at less than 100% at this point. Deyonta Davis could be looking at a start tonight, and we should also see plenty of small ball lineups with guys like JaMychal Green and Jarell Martin running the five-spot; Tyreke Evans will also be very busy on offense. The Grizzlies have a Wednesday-Thursday back-to-back set coming up, and for now, we'll be considering Gasol questionable for Wednesday's game.

Considering Love was only dealing with a hand injury, his conditioning should be okay, so he should be back fully up to speed within just a few games. His return to the court hurt's Larry Nance's (hamstring) upside.

             Turner will be a true game-time call tonight, but if he's forced to spend his second straight game on the sidelines, that would result in Al Jefferson earning another start and he'd be someone to consider in DFS. Check back closer to tip-off for official word on Turner's status.

             If Simmons can't play on Tuesday, the Magic will be desperate for some offense, so we could see guys like Mario Hezonja and Nikola Vucevic see a serious uptick in usage. Jonathan Isaac could also see a slight uptick in minutes if Simmons sits. Check back for another update following Tuesday morning's shootaround.

             Brad Stevens said on Sunday that Irving was ""feeling better,"" but they've made it clear that they won't bring him back until he's clearly 100%, so Tuesday will mark his fourth straight game on the sidelines with a sore knee. It's also not a great sign that he's getting ruled out a full 24 hours in advance. Terry Rozier and Jayson Tatum will be very busy on the offensive end while these guys are out, and Greg Monroe will see some more minutes and shots falling his way. Irving's next opportunity to play will come Friday in Portland.

            Devin Booker (right hand sprain) was limited at Monday's practice and is questionable to play Tuesday vs. the Pistons.
        
        
             Booker missed Saturday's game against the Warriors with this injury, which resulted in Troy Daniels drawing the start and Josh Jackson netting a career-high 36 points off the bench. T.J. Warren (knee) is looking unlikely for tomorrow's game, meaning Jackson could start and he'd be extremely busy on offense with both Booker and Warren unavailable. If Booker doesn't play Tuesday, his next opportunity to get out there will come Friday in Cleveland, the first game of a back-to-back.

            An MRI taken on T.J. Warren's sprained left knee came back clean, but he did not practice on Monday and is doubtful to play Tuesday vs. Detroit.
        
        
             The Suns will be in no rush to bring Warren back, and with the next game being a Friday-Saturday back-to-back set, Warren might only be playing in one game this week at best. He's a mid-round guy, but also doesn't do much for you outside of points, and at this juncture in the fantasy season, it's tough to justify hanging onto injured guys if you don't have an IR-spot. Devin Booker (hand) is also questionable to play on Tuesday, so Josh Jackson could be extremely busy tomorrow.

             This is the same toe issue that forced Napier to miss a game back in February, but we'll have a better idea on his status for tomorrow's game based on his activity level at shootaround. If Napier is forced to the sidelines, Evan Turner would likely pick up the majority of his minutes. Stay tuned.

            John Wall (knee) could practice 5-on-5 by the end of this week according to coach Scott Brooks.
        
        
             Brooks added that ""It’s not etched in stone,"" but Wall continues to progress. There was some hope that he'd be back this week, but it sounds like next week is more likely. Tomas Satoransky will continue to hold down the fort for the Wizards with Bradley Beal running most of the offense.

             We'd probably save a lot of time by listing all the players without injuries. Cook is going to be a popular streaming option tonight and has been a stud in his last two games, averaging 26.5 points, 3.5 assists, 2.5 steals, 5.0 triples and just 1.5 turnovers in that span. Keep in mind that Stephen Curry (ankle) could return later this week and the Warriors have a total of three games.

             He's a late addition to the injury report, but fantasy owners know the drill here. The Grizzlies are tanking hard, so Gasol is probably closer to doubtful. If Gasol can't go, Deyonta Davis will have some streaming appeal for his blocks and Jarell Martin would also get a significant bump. JaMychal Green would be the safest bet to produce, though.

             This is a huge relief for a Warriors team that has been decimated by injuries. McCaw isn't a fantasy pickup with these restrictions, but he could be interesting later on in the week. With McCaw active, the Warriors won't need to rely on Andre Iguodala and Nick Young quite as much.

That means he's looking at a maximum of two games played this week, so if we don't get more good news soon he'll be a drop candidate. J.J. Barea (left rib) will be a strong streaming option if he's able to go, while we should see plenty of Yogi Ferrell and maybe Kyle Collinsworth.

             The Mavericks are going to be shorthanded on Tuesday with Dennis Smith Jr. (ankle) out, so Barea will be a solid streaming option if he's able to go. The Mavericks only play three times this week though and it's very possible that the Mavs hold Barea out as a precaution. If Barea does sit this one out alongside DSJ, expect Yogi Ferrell to get all the minutes he can handle with some minutes trickling down to Kyle Collinsworth.

Hornets coach Steve Clifford has been critical of Willy Hernangomez, but he liked what he saw in his last game vs. the Knicks and it sounds like he will get the backup center minutes instead of Frank Kaminsky.

            Aaron Gordon has passed the NBA concussion protocol and will be available to play on Tuesday vs. the Raptors.
        
        
             He was stuck on the final test of the protocol for a while, but he's now ready to return after a five-game absence. We'll be on the lookout for any restrictions, but Gordon can be deployed for Orlando's 3-game week. Mario Hezonja and Jonathan Isaac both lose a lot of streaming appeal, and Khem Birch will also lose some minutes with Gordon back because he was playing a lot of PF.

             Lue has been dealing with chest pains and a lack of sleep all season but it's only gotten worse. ""I am going to use this time to focus on a prescribed routine & medication, which has previously been difficult to start in the midst of a season,"" Lue said. ""My goal is to come out of it a stronger and healthier version of myself so I can continue to lead this team to the championship"" We wish Lue all the best and hope to see him back on the sidelines soon. Associate head coach Larry Drew will hold down the fort in the meantime.

            Kyle Korver (right foot soreness) is questionable for Monday's game vs. the Bucks.
        
        
             Korver missed Saturday's game vs. the Bulls for personal reasons, but his right foot has been as issue this season. The Cavaliers are going be shorthanded again and Rodney Hood (back) has already been ruled out, so Korver will be a nice source of triples if he can play. Look for Jordan Clarkson and J.R. Smith to play heavy minutes if Korver joins Hood on the sidelines.

            Larry Nance (hamstring) will not play on Monday vs. the Bucks.
        
        
             The Cavs initially said that Nance was ""fine"" after leaving Tuesday's game vs. the Suns early, but he hasn't played since. He continues to get ruled out well in advance of games, so fantasy owners in the middle of playoffs should move on at this point for a hot pickup like a Cameron Payne or a Jeremy Lamb. Kevin Love (hand) is questionable, but if he isn't ready to return that means we'll see plenty of Jeff Green and a little Ante Zizic.

             He can't catch a break and it sounds like he tweaked his back on Thursday. Kyle Korver (foot) is questionable, but he'll be a great source of 3-pointers if he can go. Jordan Clarkson and J.R. Smith also get a bump with Hood out and we'll see more two-PG lineups with Jose Calderon picking up minutes.

             Interesting. Love was initially targeting a return on Mar. 23 vs. the Suns, so this would be a nice surprise. We'll find out more after shootaround, but if Love is floating around on the waiver wire it's time to pick him back up. If Love remains out Monday, Jeff Green and Ante Zizic will have to step up with Larry Nance (hamstring) and Tristan Thompson (ankle) still out.

I think he can do both. And he’s getting better at it."" March has been his strongest month by far with 14.1 points, 4.4 assists, 3.4 rebounds, 1.3 steals and 1.4 triples, and with four games on the schedule this week, LeVert belongs in standard-league fantasy lineups.

He shredded the Blazers' backup big men and the supporting stats were a welcome boost (zero steals or blocks in his previous three games). Fantasy owners should also beware his toxic free-throw percentages -- he's at a career-high 64.8% this season, and opponents are increasingly hacking him when he gets the ball in the paint.

            Shabazz Napier made 4-of-4 field goals in 22 minutes on Sunday, scoring nine points with eight assists, three rebounds, one block and one 3-pointer.
        
        
             Napier was coming off a poor performance vs. the Pistons on Saturday (0-of-6 in 11 minutes), but he bounced back in style tonight as the Blazers defeated the Clippers on the road in L.A. The Blazers have reeled off 13 consecutive wins and Shabazz has hovered around 18-24 minutes in that span, so there's no clear incentive to add him in standard leagues while Damian Lillard and C.J. McCollum are healthy.

             Lillard's availability tonight wasn't guaranteed because his girlfriend is due to give birth to their son on March 19 -- he was essentially 'on call' all weekend. He shouldn't be a DNP risk during the upcoming three-game week, though, since Portland hosts the Rockets on Monday and the Celtics on Friday, before traveling to OKC for Sunday's game. He's scored 20+ points in a career-best 15 straight games, and fantasy owners can deploy him with total confidence.

             Gibson battled foul trouble throughout this game, including a pair of fouls on 3-point shooters, and it was simply an off night for the nine-year veteran.

             The Wolves dropped their second game in a row -- combined with New Orleans' win on Sunday, the Wolves are now the sole occupant of the No. 8 seed. That just means they'll ride key players even more down the stretch, which is great news for Teague's owners. He's already thriving with double-digit points in 13 straight games, and at least two steals in nine of the past 10 games. If he keeps this up he'll be on plenty of league-winning fantasy squads.

             Rose was at his best in the fourth quarter tonight, attacking the rim and scoring eight of his points to keep Minnesota within striking distance. It was his best game in a Wolves' uniform but that's not saying much, since he came in averaging just 3.3 points, 1.3 assists and 1.0 rebounds in his previous three games. There are far more appealing options on the waiver wire.

             This was Crawford's fourth game all season with 20+ points, and his first such game since late January. His role has increased since Jimmy Butler (knee) went down, but even Tom Thibodeau won't play the 37-year-old Crawford more than 24-28 minutes per game. As such, he's just a low-end source of scoring and 3-pointers -- anything else is a bonus.

             The veteran came in shooting 41.0 percent from downtown over the past 28 games, which is the best mark for any Rockets player in that span. He's averaging a career-best 1.3 triples per game this season and is making a living from wing 3-pointers -- he's just 29.8% on above-the-break threes this season, but a combined 40.4% from the corners. Ryan Anderson's return hasn't diminished his role at all, so continue using him as you have been for the past month.

             Gordon began the month with five straight games in double-digits, but since then he's been all over the place -- he dropped 23 points vs. the Clippers last Thursday, but has scored five points in each of the past two games. He was also held to one point on 0-of-7 shooting vs. the Spurs on Mar. 12, and is crushing owners who need production to make (or win) their fantasy playoffs. The good news is that he gets a favorable four-game slate next week.

It's a letdown for fantasy owners who gambled on Green -- after picking up two straight DNP-CDs, he was hot tonight with 12 points on 5-of-5 shooting, including a pair of 3-pointers. It remains to be seen whether the league will issue further punishment for his actions. Judge for yourself by watching the video linked below.

             Anderson played minutes at center for the second straight game, which makes sense. The Rockets are obliterating opponents with just one loss since Jan. 28, and playing Anderson at center gives more room for P.J. Tucker and Luc Mbah a Moute in the rotation. In his current role, Anderson is just a 3-point specialist.

In addition to his long rehab from a torn hamstring, coach Alvin Gentry is trying to shorten player's stints on the court, a move he felt ""gave everyone more juice"" during Sunday's impressive home win. Hill can stay on the waiver wire in any fantasy format.

That marks his season high in FT attempts and it was encouraging to see him attacking the basket tonight, taking advantage of Greg Monroe and the inexperience of Celtics backup Semi Ojeleye. The defensive stats were huge and Mirotic's good nights continue to outweigh the bad.

            Jrue Holiday was quiet on Sunday with seven points on 2-of-5 shooting, adding four assists, three rebounds and one steal in a win vs. the visiting Celtics.
        
        
             Holiday logged 28 minutes but simply couldn't get going tonight, and was held scoreless in the first half. The eight-year veteran has been thriving with an expanded role since the All-Star break, and he hasn't been held to single-digit points in consecutive games all season. Expect him to come out firing vs. the Mavericks on Tuesday.

            Cheick Diallo scored a season-high 17 points in 24 minutes on Sunday, making 7-of-9 field goals and 3-of-4 free throws with six rebounds and one assist.
        
        
             Diallo took advantage of Boston's defensive lapses for a few wide-open dunks, but he also made a pair of jumpers and showed a soft touch around the rim. His minutes have bounced around in March and most owners should view him warily despite this nice line -- New Orleans does have a solid four-game slate next week, though, so he's not the worst gamble in deep leagues.

             The Celtics had no answer for AD tonight, as he dropped 14-of-24 field goals with a 6-of-8 mark at the line. He also committed just one turnover without a single personal foul, and continues to feast in a post-DeMarcus Cousins offense tailored entirely to his strengths. Davis did hit the court hard a number of times tonight, but he got up every time and should be fine for Tuesday's game vs. Dallas.

            Greg Monroe led Boston's reserves on Sunday with 12 points on 6-of-13 shooting, six rebounds, two assists and two steals in 26 minutes.
        
        
             Monroe continues to play a big role for the short-handed Celtics, averaging 15.0 points over the past three games, and is chipping in 7.0 rebounds and 2.0 steals in that span. He's unlikely to see more than 20-24 minutes per game due to defensive concerns, however, which was true again tonight -- Monroe struggled when New Orleans played small-ball lineups vs. the Celtics' second unit. Even if his minutes are capped, he's a cheap source of points, rebounds and FG percentage as the main beneficiary with Daniel Theis (knee) done for the season.

             Rozier has scored double-digit points in 19 consecutive games, which blows away his previous career-best streak of six straight games. Marcus Smart (thumb) will miss 6-8 weeks and with so many injuries in Boston, Rozier is suddenly a centerpiece of the Celtics' attack -- coach Brad Stevens said after the game, ""We’re going to have to figure out how to score with Jaylen [Brown] and Kyrie out."" With minutes and usage to spare, Rozier is a must-own player heading into the final weeks of the season.

             It wasn't Horford's finest hour at either end of the court, but Boston is still comfortably ensconced in the No. 2 seed -- they're 5.0 games behind Toronto, but 7.0 games up on the No. 3 seed Cavs. Fantasy owners can confidently deploy Horford for the Celtics' upcoming three-game week, beginning Tuesday vs. Steven Adams and the visiting Thunder.

             Tatum scored a season-high 27 points on Feb. 2 but hadn't hit the 20-point mark since then -- tonight's line could have been bigger, but Boston's key player rested for the final 8:57 of the fourth quarter. The rookie's usage has spiked with Kyrie Irving (knee) out of the lineup, in addition to Jaylen Brown (concussion) and Marcus Smart (thumb), giving him a nice bump in value -- Irving and Brown should be back soon, though, so enjoy it while it lasts.

The Mavs have zero incentive to rush him back, and now with just two games max next week, owners should probably just cut Smith Jr. in most settings. If J.J.

            Andrew Harrison (wrist) is questionable to play Monday against the Nets.
        
        
             He was initially expected to miss 1-2 weeks about two weeks ago, so maybe he'll be able to make it back to the court on Monday. However, after spending a few weeks on the sidelines, he'll likely be eased back into things, so Harrison can remain on the waiver wire in most settings.

            Kawhi Leonard (quad) has been ruled out for Monday's game against the Warriors.
        
        
             After Monday, Leonard will have just 11 games to make his potential return to the court, so he's clearly running out of time and is more of a liability than an asset at this point. With no clear return date in sight and heavy restrictions to be expected once/if he does get back out there, we'd recommend letting someone else deal with Leonard; particularly at this juncture in the fantasy season.

            Jimmy Butler (knee surgery) said that while he remains without an official timetable to return, he expects to make it back to the court prior to the playoffs.
        
        
             ""I’m excited at my progression because I know I’m going to be back out there with my guys soon,"" said Butler in his first presser since going under the knife back in February. The Wolves never released an official timetable for Butler, nor did they announce the specific procedure he had, but Shams Charania indicated he'd be out 4-6 weeks, so we'll go with that. Based off that timetable, the earliest Butler will be able to return to the court will be March 26 against Memphis. He's tough to stash in leagues that don't offer an IR-spot.

             Vonleh skipped Saturday's game due to the toe issue, but at least he's traveling with the team to New York, so this might end up being just a one-game absence. He doesn't have much value in fantasy hoops, though, and if he's forced to sit Bobby Portis will get all the run he can handle. Stay tuned.

With Lauri Markkanen (back) and Kris Dunn (toe) also unavailable for Monday's game, Denzel Valentine should again draw the start, and he'll be someone to look to in DFS after popping off for 34 points, seven boards, eight triples, six dimes and a block over 39 minutes on Saturday. For now, we'll be considering LaVine questionable for Wednesday's game vs. Denver.

             Monday will mark Dunn's second straight game on the sidelines, and he might not be back anytime soon as Fred Hoiberg said he's dealing with a ""turf-toe type injury."" Cameron Payne will hold down the fort at the point guard spot while Dunn and Zach LaVine (knee) are out, and he's coming off a 13-point, 10-dime game, so he'll be someone to consider streaming on Monday. Dunn is a cut-candidate in leagues that don't offer an IR-spot.

There is a chance he'll make it back at some point during the Lakers' four-game road trip, but with his next game not coming until Thursday and a maximum of just two games played next week, owners may want to seriously consider cutting him. Kyle Kuzma will continue to start while he's out, with more minutes falling to Kentavious Caldwell-Pope and Julius Randle.

The arrival of Corey Brewer has perhaps accelerated that development, as since Brewer's arrival, 63% of Melo's shot attempts have been of the catch-and-shoot variety, whereas his pull-ups now make up just 17.8% of his shot attempts.

             George struggled with his shot a bit, but he did an excellent job of getting to the rack, going 10-of-12 from the charity stripe. He also did an excellent job defensively against DeMar DeRozan, and with their sixth straight win, OKC sits just 0.5 games behind Portland for the No. 3 spot out West.

             Brodie also added one 3-pointer, two steals and five turnovers while he was out there, and he was in attack mode as soon as the ball tipped, only missing one shot through the first half of action. He then proceeded to go bonkers through the final frame of action, posting a monster 61.2 usage rate while scoring 17 of his 37 points as he willed OKC to victory. Additionally, with his fifth straight triple-double, he joined Oscar Roberson as the only players in NBA history with three, five-game triple-double streaks.

             Wright went 6-of-8 from the field and was a perfect 2-of-2 from the charity stripe for a remarkable 84.5 true shooting percentage, and he took advantage of some increased opportunity with Fred VanVleet (hand) unavailable and Kyle Lowry in foul trouble for much of the game. Wright is capable of producing these sort of stat lines when given the minutes, but his inconsistent run makes him more of a deep league guy.

             Ibaka added one 3-pointer, six rebounds, two assists, two steals and three turnovers while he was out there, but he really struggled to get anything going against OKC's defense. Jonas Valanciunas (who struggled with foul trouble) wasn't much better, finishing with 10 points, two boards, two assists, three turnovers and nothing else across 22 minutes, but we'd expect a bit of a bounce-back performance from both these guys on Tuesday in Orlando.

             DeRozan struggled to get his shot to drop through the first half of action, but he turned it around after halftime with Kyle Lowry hitting the bench early in the third due to foul trouble. As a team, the Raptors struggled with foul trouble which is perhaps why tempers flared late when DeRozan felt he was fouled by Corey Brewer on a layup attempt, resulting in DeRozan picking up a double tech with eight seconds left and getting ejected, along with Serge Ibaka and his head coach Dwane Casey.

             Lowry got off to a hot start, draining his first three shots (all trey-bombs), and he finished the game 7-of-10 from the field and 3-of-3 from the charity stripe for an insane 97.2 true shooting percentage. He might have had an even nicer line, but he was in foul trouble throughout the game and fouled out through the final frame of action. As a side note, the Raptors had been 43-1 when leading through three quarters this season, but that number dropped to 43-2 after Sunday's loss.

It seems unlikely that Jackson will be able to get back out there on Monday in Sacramento with it being the first game of a back-to-back set, but Saturday seems realistic.

             Head coach Mike Malone said prior to Saturday's game that he expected Harris to miss at least the next 3-4 games, and Monday will mark his second straight game on the sidelines. If he only needs to miss three games, he could get back out there for Friday's game against Washington, but it looks like in a best-case scenario he'll only be on the floor for one game next week. Malone also said he expects to have Harris back at some point during Denver's seven-game road trip, which ends on March 27. If you don't have an IR-spot or a bye-week, Harris is a cut-candidate.

             Batum exited Saturday's game with the Achilles issue, and with the postseason seeming unlikely for Charlotte, they might want to play it safe with Batum and hold him out on Monday night. Zeller has missed the past four, and if he's out again on Monday, Frank Kaminsky will continue to pick up most of his minutes. Check back for another update following Monday morning's shootaround.

             Crabbe missed the past two games with the illness, which prompted Joe Harris to move into the starting five, but Harris will likely return to the second unit on Monday with Crabbe back in action. Crabbe is good for some triples, but he's been too inconsistent to trust in standard settings this year.

             The road trip begins on Monday vs. the Pacers and ends on March 26 vs. Detroit. Ingram was just cleared for non-contact work and hasn't practiced in full yet, so we probably won't see him return on Monday. ""I wouldn’t be surprised if he plays on the road trip,"" coach Luke Walton said. ""He’s feeling much better, he says. But we’re going to keep being patient with him and make sure that he goes through all the proper channels before we throw him back out there."" Kyle Kuzma will continue to start at SF while Ingram is out which also benefits Julius Randle and Brook Lopez.

            Jaylen Brown (concussion) is listed as out for Sunday's game vs. the Pelicans.
        
        
             This is just a reminder, as Brown is scheduled to be re-evaluated early next week. The Celtics only play three times next week and it's hard to imagine Brown getting cleared for Tuesday's game vs. the Thunder, so owners in weekly formats shouldn't start him for the time being. Kyrie Irving (knee) is questionable and could be back Sunday, but look for Terry Rozier, Shane Larkin, Jayson Tatum and Marcus Morris to pick up extra run in Brown's absence.

             This comes from the official game notes, but it's worth noting that Irving was previously listed as out. He traveled with the team to New Orleans and we should get another update following the morning shootaround. If Irving returns from a two-game absence, the Celtics won't need to rely on Terry Rozier, Jayson Tatum and Al Horford nearly as much.

             ""I’m not going to sit here and deny that I want to play more,"" Carter said. ""Things changed. We aren’t winning and the younger guys need to get better. I get that, but at the same time, I try to make the best of it. That way if it doesn’t work out here, I can still play on another team, maybe a contending team, in a lesser role."" Carter will be 42 in what is expected to be his final NBA campaign in 2018-19.

             ""I just try to still play my game and not think I’m going to be Stephen, Kevin or Klay,"" Green said. ""I am who I am and bring to this team what I bring so just continue to play my game. It may mean a few more shots here or there. It’s just not my goal to say, ‘I need to jack up my scoring.’ If it happens, it happens – if not, I’m going to try and lead the guys and play the best that we can."" If Saturday was any indication, Green is going to have some monster lines in the short term. He had 25 points, 11 rebounds, eight assists, four triples, one steal, one block and three turnovers, but just keep in mind that's one technical foul away from a one-game suspension.

It's worth noting that the Pelicans play five games over the next six days, so if Rondo is less than 100 percent and fatigued, that means there's a good chance that another DNP is in his near future. When that happens, look for Ian Clark to step up after he scored 17 points with three assists, two rebounds and one triple on Saturday.

""There's a chance that he might be able to play a few minutes tomorrow,"" coach Alvin Gentry said on Saturday. Hill has yet to play this season after undergoing hamstring surgery in October, but once cleared, he'll give the Pelicans some much-needed wing depth. He'll be listed as questionable Sunday.

He continues to log big-time minutes with Jimmy Butler (knee) on the shelf, and it might not be until the NBA playoffs before we see Butler against. As such, Bjelica will continue to play a huge role down the stretch in Minnesota and for fantasy owners.

            Jeff Teague went for 16 points across 31 minutes in Saturday's road loss against the Spurs.
        
        
             Teague hit 6-of-13 from the field, including 1-of-1 from behind the 3-point line, while knocking down 3-of-4 from the charity stripe. He also chipped in with eight assists, two rebounds and two steals. Teague is working on a season-high 12-game streak with 10 or more points, as fantasy owners are enjoying his best stretch of the season. The Wolves will be back at it on Sunday against the Rockets.

             It was just another night at the office for KAT, and perhaps the only thing fantasy owners and T'Wolves fans can complain about would be his five turnovers. He has two or more 3-pointers in three straight outings, and he is averaging 26.5 points and 11.5 rebounds per game across his past four starts. No one can complain about his durability, as he is yet to miss a game this season.

             Len did a nice job on the glass, but it was tough for him to stay on the floor with the Dubs constantly trotting out small-ball lineups, and he didn’t bring much else to the stat sheet. If you think Len’s inconsistency is annoying now, just wait for Alan Williams (knee) to get into the rotation.

             Jackson didn’t waste any time to get going once he got into the game, rattling off 18 points during his first 12-minute stint, and he never really took his foot off the gas pedal. He's been on quite the hot streak over the past three with averages of 24.0 points, 6.0 boards, 2.0 assists, 2.0 steals, 1.3 triples, 0.7 swats and 2.7 turnovers per game on 53.1% shooting, and with T.J.

             Daniels had the hot hand early for Phoenix, drilling three triples within his first five minutes of play, and he also came through with the defensive stats. Devin Booker’s hand injury doesn’t seem all that serious, but with T.J. Warren leaving the game with a knee injury there could be more opportunity for Daniels moving forward. Still, he’s not much more than a deep league, 3-point specialist and the Suns don’t play again until Tuesday.

             That's better, but still not great. Payton had been mired in a brutal cold streak over the past five games, so perhaps this is a sign that he's ready to start getting it going again. He's got decent upside, but if Payton puts up another stinker on Tuesday with a favorable matchup against the Pistons, owners may want to consider moving on.

             Make it 12 straight for the red-hot Blazers to give them a two-game lead over the Thunder for the No. 3 spot, and a huge 5.5-game cushion to remain in the postseason. The Blazers first unit has been solid on defense, but Dame has been no slouch with averages of 31.1 points, 4.3 boards, 6.8 assists, 1.0 steals and 4.0 treys. He has a tidy 61.5 TS% and a 32.3 usage rate, so Dame is scoring the ball extremely well. They get a big game against the Clippers on Sunday.

Jordan Bell finished with four points, two rebounds, four assists, two steals, two blocks and zero turnovers in 18 minutes off the bench, and he too is on the radar as a low-end big to own in deep leagues.

             Green went 10-of-20 from the field and 1-of-2 from the stripe, and his 20 field goal attempts accounted for the most amount of shots he’d taken in a regular-season game since December 11 of 2015 (not once did he attempt 20 shots during the 2016-17 season). He’s obviously going to be more involved in the offense as the last man standing out of the Core Four (27.2 usage over the past two), and he should have a handful of triple-doubles coming his way.

In the last 10 games, Drummond and Blake Griffin have just a -7.4 net rating together, but Drummond without Blake has been a horrible -20.8. This season can't end soon enough for the Pistons, but not for Drummond's fantasy owners.

            T.J. Warren exited Saturday's loss to the Warriors during the fourth quarter with a sprained left knee, and he's being listed as ""day-to-day.""
        
        
             Warren ended his evening with nine points, three rebounds, one 3-pointer, one assist, two steals, one block and three turnovers in 30 minutes, but the severity of his injury is not currently clear. With the Suns sitting on the worst record in the league, there obviously won't be much incentive to rush Warren back to the court, so he could miss at least a few games here. The Suns have just three games next week and if Warren can't play on Tuesday, owners will need to consider cutting him. Josh Jackson looks like an extremely enticing speculative add in most leagues.

             The Pistons didn't say if he was going to play all game and it took his walk to the scoring table to find out he was out there. Kennard's minutes were back up from just 18 on Thursday, so this confirms that 18 was likely due to his hammy. The Pistons are done, so maybe they up the rookie's minutes. He's not exactly a strong stash, though.

             He made 7-of-8 from the field and 8-of-10 from the line for this tidy 20-10. That's now three straight 20-10s for Gobert and he also has multiple blocks in five straight games. The Jazz are by far the best defensive team in the league over their last 23 games with their 21-2 record and their team net rating of +13.1 leads the NBA in that span. Gobert has been an absolute monster this month and no player with two eye brows has been better than him since Mar. 1 for total fantasy value.

             Blakeney was jacking up plenty of shots, hitting 4-of-14 from the field, including just 1-of-6 from behind the 3-point line, while adding three assists, a rebound and a steal. He was taking advantage of several injuries in Chitown, and the fact Justin Holiday wasn't doing much as a starter. Despite the bump in minutes, Blakeney isn't really someone to bother with in fantasy basketball at this juncture.

             He so much fun that he should be illegal. Mitchell had a whole highlight reel in the second half with 17 points, many of those coming as beautiful drives and dunks. The Mitchell ROY talk has to start heating up again because his team has put up a net rating of +16.7 over their last 23 games while Mitchell leads the team with his 28.1 usage rate. He's been arguably the best value/pickup in fantasy this year, and it's an easy argument to make.

             Portis was a solid 7-of-15 from the field, including 1-of-2 from behind the 3-point line, but even with Lauri Markkanen (back) on the shelf he was kept in a reserve role with Denzel Valentine and Paul Zipser in the starting five. Portis might be the best fantasy option in Chicago when Markkanen isn't healthy.

             That's three straight games with at least 22 points for easily his best three-game stretch on the year. Hield has been awesome since back on Feb. 26 and has been an absolute stud in fantasy because of so many games. In that span, he averaged 14.1 points, 4.6 boards, 2.9 assists, 0.8 steals, 0.7 blocks and 2.1 treys. With that games-played edge, he's actually been a top-30 player in standard leagues. He's also on fire, so Hield looks like a must-start guy after being extremely inconsistent.

Still, his playing time is safe as he continues to add some defensive stats. He's basically a must-start player.

            Paul Zipser finished Saturday's game against the Cavaliers with 11 points across 24 minutes.
        
        
             Zipser was in the starting five with several injuries across the board for the home team. He hit 4-of-9 from the field, including 3-of-4 from downtown, while chipping in with four rebounds, two assists and two blocked shots. It's uncertain if he will be called upon again on Monday in New York, but he is an OK low-priced DFS option if he gets the nod again. In seasonal fantasy play he is a less attractive option.

            Denzel Valentine made the most of his opportunity to start Saturday against the Cavaliers, finishing with a career-high 34 points.
        
        
             Valentine moved into the starting five with Zach LaVine (knee) sidelined, and he played 39 minutes with Kris Dunn (toe) and Lauri Markkanen (back) also missing in action. He hit 13-of-20 from the field, including an impressive 8-of-11 from behind the 3-point line, while chipping in with seven rebounds, six assists and a blocked shot. If he is called upon to start again Monday in New York he might be a solid DFS option, although expect plenty of others to also use him after this huge performance.

             The 19-game losing streak is over and Gasol was relieved. After the game on the Grizzlies broadcast, Gasol said it was fun to play as a team and it was great to get a win for the fans. He's been vocal about being anti-tank, but of course it's not his call. The Grizzlies have a back-to-back set coming up on Mar. 21-22, so Gasol is probably sitting for one of those.

             He has been comfortable at small forward and it looks like that'll happen all year. Over his last five, Martin averaged 13.2 points, 5.8 boards, 2.4 assists, 1.0 blocks and 0.8 treys in 31.0 minutes. His playing time hasn't dropped since Tyreke Evans came back, so expect him to have value in the short term.

             Evans playing on Thursday was surprising and maybe the Grizzlies really wanted to snap their losing streak, which they did tonight. It'll be interesting to see what the plan is for the Grizzlies now, but they do have a back-to-back set on Wednesday and Thursday. Keep rolling with Tyreke as long as he's active.

            Brandon Ingram (groin) has not yet gone through a full practice with the Lakers, so it's unlikely he'll play on Monday in Indiana.
        
        
             ""Hopefully, I can get to practice in New Orleans and practice with the guys,"" Ingram said. ""It's been a long time since I've practiced with them. So, hopefully, I can get out there and do some contact drills."" Thus far he's been limited to non-contact work, but Luke Walton did say he ""wouldn't be surprised"" if Ingram returned at some point during the Lakers' upcoming four-game road trip. However, if Ingram sits on Monday, that would give him a max of just two games next week, so he's a risky guy to hang onto at this juncture in the fantasy season.

             He also had one of his best defensive games in a while with some strong possessions against Jamal Murray. Brooks is somewhat hot on offense over his last five, averaging 18.0 points, 3.2 boards, 1.4 assists, 0.8 steals and 2.2 treys in 32.2 minutes per game. The lack of actual defensive stats hurts him, so he's only a lukewarm fantasy asset.

             Smith hit just 1-of-7 from the field, including 1-of-3 from behind the 3-point line, while going 2-of-2 from the free-throw line. He was able to contribute five rebounds, an assist and a steal, but it was an all-around ugly fantasy performance for Smith. He is an ugly 8-of-29 (27.6 percent) from the field over the past four games, and this is why head coach Tyronn Lue is keeping him out of the starting five, even with Rodney Hood (back) and Kyle Korver (personal) sidelined.

He didn't contribute much else for fantasy owners, but he continues to roll up big minutes off the bench while scoring well. He continues to lead the NBA in baskets made by a reserve.

             Yeah, not great here to lose to this Grizzlies team that was on a 19-game losing streak. The good news for them is the Clippers and Pelicans have lost two straight, but coach Mike Malone was not happy here. ""We came out as flat as a pancake,"" Malone said. After a loss like this, the Nuggets may feel all mixed up like Aunt Jemima.

             He struggled wit his shot early and started 1-of-7, and he was also careless late in the game during this bad loss. Most nights, there would have been a very good chance Murray didn't close out, but now coach Mike Malone has to give him a longer leash because of no Gary Harris (knee). Murray should have a higher floor most nights.

             The scoring wasn't good, but at least he did other stuff. Bartonis going to see minutes in the upper 30s most nights now that Gary Harris (knee) is out for a bit. He has cooled off in a big way after he went off in February, but his fantasy owners should be expecting him to flirt with early-round value.

             Hicks was a perfect 5-of-5 from the field and he was 2-of-2 from the free-throw line, adding eight rebounds, two assists and a steal. It was a nice little payback game for the undrafted Hicks, who went to training camp with the Hornets before being waived. Despite the solid line he isn't someone to bother with in fantasy basketball.

He hasn't made a 3-pointer since Jan. 26, but does enough in other categories to make up the difference -- congrats to those who grabbed him off the wire following his injury.

He hit 5-of-8 from the bench and 2-of-3 from behind the 3-point line while adding three rebounds, three assists and a blocked shot. Ntilikina has some upside and could eventually be a consistent player in this league, but right now he is a risky fantasy play even in deeper leagues.

The good news is that he's still making his free throws (84.6% in March), and appeared to have extra bounce in his step tonight -- the four blocks were his highest since Oct 22. As long as he's healthy, keep rolling him out there.

It's worth a mention that this is on the same leg as his ACL injury, so maybe the medical staff is worried about how that impacts his whole leg. If he's out, Yogi Ferrell will benefit the most.

             Burke hit 6-of-13 from the floor, including 2-of-4 from behind the 3-point line, while chipping in with five assists and three rebounds while turning it over zero times. The Knicks have a hodgepodge in the backcourt, but Burke has been the cream rising to the top lately. He is working on a four-game streak with double-digit point totals, averaging 14.0 points per game. Unfortunately, scoring is about all he has been doing for fantasy owners.

             Allen Crabbe (illness) was out sick but the Nets once again opted to start Joe Harris over Dinwiddie. ""I think Spencer is in a little bit of a rut ... offensively,"" coach Kenny Atkinson said before the game. '""Defensively he’s been very good. But sometimes you’ve got to tweak things ... Is this permanent? I have no idea."" The Nets are 13th in the Eastern Conference with 12 games remaining, so permanence is a fluid concept -- fantasy owners can be satisfied that Dinwiddie is averaging 31.0 minutes over the past two games.

             Williams was solid again, hitting 6-of-10 from the field, including 1-of-3 from behind the 3-point line. It appears he has found a home in Gotham, as the team locked him up to a two-year deal earlier this week, guaranteeing him for the rest of the season. He has shown glimpses of brilliance, but his playing time and production has yo-yoed quite a bit. For now, he should only be trusted in the deepest of fantasy formats.

             That's two big wins for the Wizards against playoff teams after a victory against the injured Celtics on Wednesday. The Wizards sit in a tight race for seeding in the 3-6 range, which should help Beal avoid the dreaded rest. He's also off for three days here, and there's a chance he'll have his backcourt mate, John Wall, back next week. Wall should be limited on his playing time for at least a few games and Beal scores just fine with him anyway, so Beal's owners should still have high expectations.

             The 39-year-old's minutes actually increased after playing 24 minutes vs. Toronto on Friday. The Mavs have done a great job limiting his workload and it's paying dividends for fantasy owners, who would rather see him with minutes in the mid-20s than picking up occasional DNPs. He's missed just one game all season and Saturday's appearance moved him past Kevin Garnett for fifth-place in NBA history with 1,463 games played (1,463).

             So what's going to happen when John Wall comes back? Satoransky has been too good at the point, and maybe the team tried to find him more minutes at SG like they were earlier in his career. Wall is still likely going to have extensive limits once he's back and that may be due to Sato helping out. The bad news is the Wizards are off for three days after this game, but his owners may want to hold on unless they really need games right now.

             Lamb hit 2-of-7 from the field, including 1-of-3 from behind the 3-point line, while adding two rebounds, an assist and a blocked shot. He could continue to see an increase in playing time heading into the new week if Nicolas Batum (Achilles') is forced to miss time after leaving Saturday's game due to soreness in his Achilles' tendon.

             Powell logged 33 minutes despite coming off the bench on Friday, and frontcourt minutes were easier to find tonight with Finney-Smith and Nerlens Noel both resting in the second of back-to-back games. Powell has now made 5-of-5 three-pointers over his past four games, with zero blocks in that stretch, so his fantasy value is largely dependent upon your team needs.

             Dallas came into this game with the sixth-worst record in the NBA, but they've been tanking much less than teams with epic losing streaks like the Grizzlies (19 straight losses), Knicks (nine), Suns (seven), Hawks (six). Barnes should be cleared to go vs. the Pelicans on Tuesday, and tonight's line is a visceral reminder that McBuckets is a hollow source of fantasy value.

             Williams hit 2-of-8 from the field, and 0-of-4 from behind the 3-point line, doing most of his damage from the free-throw stripe with a 6-of-6 evening. He added seven rebounds and a steal with just one turnover, but it was a poor all-around night with a minus-16 rating. He and his teammates will be in action again Monday in Philadelphia to kick off a four-game work week.

             Bacon hit 6-of-10 from the field while adding three assists and two steals, and he is just about the only one from Buzz City who shouldn't be hanging his head after this performance. He and Jeremy Lamb might benefit with some extra run starting Monday in Philadelphia if the injury Nicolas Batum (Achilles') suffered forces him to miss time.

             Not only does he have a 53-game streak with at least one steal, but he now has a six-game streak with at least two steals. Although, his scoring is down in that span at just 17.3 points per game, but the 3.0 steals per night easily make up for it.

             Walker didn't do much to help his fantasy owners, hitting just 4-of-10 from the floor while adding only two assists and one rebound with no other stats. He'll look for a bounce-back game on Monday in Philadelphia, kicking off a four-game week in what will be the fantasy playoffs for many. It could be another tough game for Walker, though, as he scored just six points with five personal fouls across 25 minutes in his last trip to the City of Brotherly Love on March 2.

             The Pacers first unit got beat up today and Cory Joseph was a -24, so you would think this has to be the last time he comes off the bench. Although, we thought that last time they lost to the Raptors. Either way, Collison should still be owned in all leagues.

             It wasn't a bad performance given his limited minutes, as he picked up four personal fouls and spent his night at the mercy of the referee's whistle. He also saw plenty of rest in the second half when the gave got away from the Hornets after the Knicks blew off their doors in a 42-17 third quarter. It was his 43rd double-double of the season, fourth-best in the NBA. Next up is a trip to Philadelphia on Monday to kick off a four-game week.

             This was a nice bounce-back performance from Ariza following Thursday’s 2-of-10 shooting performance, and he had the hot hand early for Houston, opening the game with a triple while hitting four of his first five attempts. While he got his shot back on track in this one, this was also his fourth game in a row without a single steal, but he should be able to buck that trend on Sunday in Minnesota.

             Anderson is one of the more injury-prone guys out there, so you can bet that the Rockets will be cautious in brining him back. He missed both his shots, struggled with foul trouble and didn’t even hit a triple, so there’s no reason to go pick him up now that he’s active again.

             Capela did an excellent job creating second-chance opportunities for Houston with his work on the offensive glass, something that has been the norm for him this year as he sits in the top-5 in offensive rebounding rate (13.3). Capela did appear to tweak his left thumb during the first half, but he played through it, and we wouldn’t expect it to become an issue that forces him to the sidelines.

             That absolutely works and the two blocks are a nice little bonus. There's a very good chance both Myles Turner (ankle) and Domantas Sabonis (ankle) won't play on Monday  against the Lakers, so Jefferson could have another start. It's still tough to add him until we know for sure that at least one is out.

             Liggins spent most of his energy chasing around James Harden, and he did do a nice job of making Harden work for everything, but all that is irrelevant in fantasy hoops.

             Clark came off the bench guns blazing and put up nine quick points on 4-of-5 shooting, and did a nice job of creating a spark with the second unit. However, he won’t be hitting 89% of his shots on most nights and with Rajon Rondo (rest) due back on Monday, Clark’s minutes will likely return to the lower-20s, so he’s not worth swooping up in most settings.

             Holiday had the hot hand early for New Orleans, and he also helped them go on a big run late to keep the game competitive, but silly turnovers were an issue that arguably cost the Pelicans the game. Holiday did get whacked in the face during the first half, which opened up a cut over his left eye, but he got right back out there after getting patched up in the locker room and we wouldn’t anticipate this being an issue that forces him to spend any time on the sidelines.

             Davis dominated down low, as the Pelicans made it an effort to feed him in the post early, and he also did a nice job of finishing through contact and picking up bonus points at the line. However, after a hot first half, the Rockets did a really nice job of loading up on AD, denying him the ball and doubling him as soon as he touched the rock, so his production tallied off after halftime. The Pelicans also were a bit over-reliant on Davis and didn’t do a great job of moving the ball, but Rajon Rondo should help them get things back on track on Monday.

             Mirotic added one 3-pointer, four boards, one assist and two turnovers while he was out there, and he's been in a major rut over the past five games with averages of 7.4 points, 7.8 boards, 1.0 assist and just 0.8 triples per contest on 29.2% shooting. In years past, Mirotic has struggled through the first half of the season only to dominate after the All-Star break, but it seems as though this season, the reverse has been true.

             The Bucks are giving him ridiculous minutes and it has a lot to do with how poorly the Bucks play without him. On the season, the Bucks have a -9.1 net rating when Giannis is off the floor. That's by far the worst on the team among players that have been on the roster all year (Henson -3.2). Fantasy owners are enjoying the extra playing time and Giannis should continue to see major usage.

He's been fun to watch lately, though.

             Apparently having right peroneal nerve irritation is a good thing for Prince because he was probable for that reason. His other 38-point game came just four games ago and he's up to a ridiculous 123 points over his last four. That's the most points in a four-game span for a Hawk since Joe Johnson's 126 in 2009. Prince was extremely annoying to owe before the break, but he's shaping up to be a huge impact player down the stretch. Congrats to anyone who held on through the tough times.

            Nicolas Batum (left Achilles soreness) is doubtful to return for Saturday against the Bulls.
        
        
             While Batum hasn't had Achilles issues before, that is not good even in a blowout. The Hornets are in the lottery and they may just want to hold him out of the lineup. Jeremy Lamb is probably worth adding speculatively in most leagues because he would pick up some heavy minutes.

            Dennis Smith Jr. (left ankle) won't return after heading into the locker room during the third quarter on Saturday.
        
        
             DSJ turned his left ankle while stepping on Spencer Dinwiddie's foot, and he's been diagnosed with a left ankle sprain. Yogi Ferrell, Kyle Collinsworth and J.J. Barea should soak up his minutes if he's forced to miss extra time, but owners should consider him questionable for Tuesday's road game in New Orleans.

            The Warriors believe Patrick McCaw (wrist) will likely return in San Antonio on Monday, according to Anthony Slater of The Athletic.
        
        
             The Warriors are almost out of depth on the wing, so McCaw would be in the rotation. He's had a letdown year after a head-turning rookie season, so he's only worth an add in very deep leagues. This slightly takes away from Nick Young and Andre Iguodala.

             John Collins went down with an ankle injury and it's no secret the Hawks are in the mix for the lottery, so Collins could miss time. Muscala has put up some nice numbers over his last five, averaging 11.0 points, 5.8 boards, 0.8 blocks, 0.8 steals and 2.2 treys in 23.0 minutes per game. That's already something that is worth owning, so he may be worth an add if you need a 3-point big.

             He did close this game out because Dennis Schroder fouled out. Taylor is the only other healthy PG right now, so he should be able to get close to 24 minutes most nights -- he plays next to Schroder, too. He has low-end value now, and would be a great add if Schroder ever missed time.

Collins took his shoe off on the bench, put it back on, attempted his free throws, and walked back to the locker room without much of a limp. Hopefully he's OK, but the Hawks had no reason to put him back on the floor tonight. We'll see more Mike Muscala and Dewayne Dedmon tonight, and Muscala does become an attractive pickup if you had your eye on him already. Dedmon, too. Collins was going off with 15 points, 12 boards and one dime in 26 minutes, so hopefully he's OK.

             He hasn't logged a minute since he signed his 10-day deal back on Mar. 8. Hopefully this doesn't have anything to do with Jusuf Nurkic's ankle. Even if Nurk is limited, Papa G is likely way down in the pecking order.

The Mavs are shorthanded tonight, so both guys could get over 20 minutes. We should still see Yogi Ferrell get a ton of minutes off the bench while Maxi Kleber likely backs up McBuckets. There's not much fantasy appeal beyond tonight.

             With the Spurs next game just 48 hours away, it seems unlikely that Leonard will be able to play on Monday vs. Golden State. Kyle Anderson will continue to hold down the fort in his absence with LaMarcus Aldridge doing the heavy lifting on offense. At this point in the season, Leonard is becoming more of a liability than an asset.

             The Nuggets are being a little shady here, but this is the most concrete thing they've said. Malone originally said the injury was ""somewhere in the middle"" of the lower half of the leg, and the Nuggets still haven't released exactly what ligament, tendon or muscle is the problem. Unless Malone is playing games with us -- that is possible, as we all know -- Harris' fantasy owners probably shouldn't expect him back for about a week, which means they have a decision on their hands. Torrey Craig, Devin Harris and Malik Beasley could see run, but the fantasy takeaway here is the other starters gain value with Will Barton, Wilson Chandler and Jamal Murray locked and loaded.

             That's a discouraging quote and it sounds like this injury is going to linger a bit for Dunn. Considering the Bulls were just called out by the league for resting healthy players, you'd think Dunn would miss additional time here. If you need games now, he's a drop candidate. Believe it or not, Cameron Payne is a solid pickup if you need a point guard.

With Kris Dunn (toe) getting ruled out yesterday, it's hard to believe that Payne is one of the hottest pickups in fantasy hoops right now. Yes, this last month is going to be wild.

It'll be Justin Holiday getting a shot in the rotation, but it's still tough to count on him because his playing time has been so low. LaVine has not been very good lately, so dropping him is an option that is on the table, depending on your situation.

             It's too bad after he had his best game of the season with six points, six rebounds, three assists, five steals and three blocks. Noel is probably not going to play in back-to-back sets any time soon with their next one starting on Mar. 27. He may still be worth owning, though. For tonight, this should mean Dwight Powell is ready to roll while we should see more Maxi Kleber and Doug McDermott.

Jefferson was very good on Thursday while Turner battled his ankle issue with a 20-point, 12-board line. Jefferson probably won't hit 30 minutes, but he could be getting a lot of shots with a double-double.

             The Pacers gave some optimistic answers yesterday, but it wouldn't have been easy for Turner to play after rolling his ankle twice on Thursday. He had a lot of swelling on Thursday and getting ruled out before warmups doesn't bode too well for him on Monday. It's Al Jefferson season tonight while we should see a lot of Trevor Booker. Both are on the board as streams and DFS plays. Expect to see a lot of small-ball lineups to give the guards more minutes, too.

             He's been out for the season, but he has been running since back in December. He'll have some heavy limits on his playing time, so he won't be a fantasy asset for a few weeks. He could take a few minutes from guys like Darius Miller.

             At one point, he was hopeful to return in January, but the Pelicans shouldn't be rushing back a guy that's had foot problems. Hopefully, we get a look at him for Summer League.

             It's the front end of a back-to-back set for the Pelicans, so it makes sense to rest their vet. You can also assume that Rondo will rest either Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday. With him out, it'll be DeAndre Liggins likely getting the start, but the guy you want is Ian Clark. He'll be a popular DFS play and he's even worth a stream.

The Warriors are going to have to play Nick Young a ton while they'll also have to play more traditional power forwards throughout games.

             He was called probable for this leg injury, but of course the Hawks are in the mix for the lottery. It sounds like Prince should be good to go in a non-B2B. He's been red hot as a stat filler, so he's a must-start player. He'll be risky in DFS, though.

             He was hobbling around after LeBron James submitted his case for dunk of the year, so it's likely from that. It's only being called soreness, so perhaps Nurkic can give it a go. If he is out, that means we'll see more Ed Davis and Zach Collins. Meyers Leonard would likely be next man up and may even start.

             This is the expected report here after Iggy played 31 minutes on Friday, and he also banged knees. It's a late start for Iguodala, so we probably won't get any more information because the Warriors aren't shooting around today. If he can't go, he would be a strong fantasy play for season-long leagues and he should be owned. He's a DFS play, but there's a chance he sits.

In that time per-36 minutes, Green posted just 10.8 points, 7.2 boards, 6.9 assists, 1.4 blocks, 1.8 steals and 1.4 treys. He does get a 4.0 usage rate bump, but his efficiency is brutal at 45.5 TS%. Specific stats aside, he gets the Suns and he could have a monster game this evening.

            Dante Cunningham has been diagnosed with a concussion and will not play Saturday vs. Dallas.
        
        
             Cunningham took a shot to the face in the first half of Friday's loss to the Sixers. He left the court bleeding and did not return. Jahlil Okafor scored 10 points with three rebounds and two blocks in 13 minutes on Friday. Okafor will likely see double-digit minutes off the bench on Saturday as well.

             Harris injured his knee after landing awkwardly following a dunk attempt on Thursday night. The X-ray's came back negative, but we are still awaiting the results of the MRI. We'll pass along an update on Harris' status moving forward once they are available. Fantasy owners will have to sit tight until then. Will Barton and Jamal Murray are the primary beneficiaries with Harris sidelined, as they will see a spike in their usage rates. Devin Harris and Malik Beasley should see an uptick in minutes off the bench as well.

Davis was attempting an NBA comeback last year, but now has far more significant concerns.

We’ll have it reevaluated [Saturday] morning. Hopefully, it doesn’t swell up too much. But I’m walking, so it’s not too serious.""

He started 67 of the Mavs first 69 games this season, but Dallas has two more sets of back-to-backs left this season, so Barnes may be rested in those contests as well.

             Randle has now scored 20 or more points in four straight games for the first time in his career. It's no coincidence that he's done this without Brandon Ingram (groin), as Kyle Kuzma can't steal his minutes when he's playing mostly SF and Randle's touches go way up without the second-year forward. Ingram is now considered day-to-day, but Randle's owners should continue to ride him as he makes his case for a monster payday as a restricted free agent this summer.

             He was quiet for most of the game and the Kings aren't running plays for him nearly as much. Cauley-Stein may have had the play of the game with a block on Nick Young to lead to a WCS dunk to seal the deal. The Kings are now on a two-game winning streak to push them back to the No. 7 spot in the lottery with the Knicks only 1.5 games behind them. Sam Hinkie is not impressed.

             Both Frank Mason and Buddy Hield had it working, so coach Dave Joerger gave those two extended minutes. Although, Bogdan was out there in the final two minutes. Bogdanovic will be at risk to lose minutes when he struggles, but he's played well coming into this game. He's still a hold and should be near 30 minutes at Utah on Saturday.

             He did not play well in this game on either end. It was surprising to see coach Dave Joerger go back to Fox down the stretch over Frank Mason because FM3 had performed almost all game. Interestingly, Fox went 3-of-3 down the stretch after he started 0-of-5 from the field, so the clutch narrative continues. This game was brutal, but the confidence from his coach bodes well for better lines ahead.

             Thomas also had the final shot of the one-point loss with a few seconds left, but couldn't get it to go down. He hit 3-of-4 free throws and the rest of his stats weren't great either with three assists, two rebounds and three turnovers. Thomas had 20+ points in his previous three games, so his fantasy owners should shake this one off and expect him to bounce back vs. the Pacers on Monday.

             He continues to drive into the paint and his minutes went up because of his ability to control the tempo. It looked like he was going to close, but De'Aaron Fox came back despite a quiet game from the starter. Mason's minutes should still be able to hang in the 20s because the Kings should start to rest players again. He's not exactly the most fantasy-friendly guy, but he's worth a look if you're OK with bad FG%.

             He did come off the bench, but he looked 100 percent and put up some impressive offense. Labissiere also closed this game out for the most part, but he did slow down late because he had Draymond Green guarding him. Considering how well he played before his hip injury last week and his performance tonight, Skal looks like an add in standard leagues.

We still don't know when Hassan Whiteside (hip) will return, but Olynyk was actually the second best big to own before Whiteside went down. Even if Miami gets some bodies back, Olynyk can be trusted with a four-game week coming up.

             It was a great game from Dray and he was involved in the offense much more than usual. There's no doubt Dray will seeing an uptick in per-minute value, but the question will be how many minutes he'll get. The Warriors are now three games down in the loss column and the Blazers almost certainly won't catch them, so the rest of the regular season is fairly close to meaningless. With Dray dealing with a lingering shoulder injury, there is a very good chance he gets rest, which could happen on Saturday.

The All-Star PG is peaking at the perfect time for his fantasy owners and scored 33 and 23 points in his previous two games.

             The Warriors used West as a ball-handler with some high-low action, and that'll probably continue because of how thin they are. Still, his minutes are going to be capped, which means he's not an add in most leagues.

             The Warriors usually don't up Livingston's minutes, but it's noteworthy he did play in the last back-to-back set on Mar. 8-9. He's been basically right at 20 minutes over his last four games, so expect him to be there again even with the Warriors losing so many guys. Based on his per-minute value, that's not enough to get it done.

             He is now ticketed for huge minutes with the three studs out and now Omri Casspi (ankle) went down tonight. Young is going to have his inefficiency issues at times, but he has a chance to flirt with 20 points per game over the next week-plus. If you can live with poor FG% and want points, Young should probably be owned.

             The Warriors are haunted by ankle injuries right now, and Bell has suffered multiple aggravations. He's on the radar as a possible DFS punt or stream, but we'd feel a lot better if he can get to 18-24 minutes.

             The Warriors are running out of forwards with Omri Casspi also going down. With Kevin Durant (ribs) out two weeks, Iguodala should find himself getting minutes close to 30, assuming he's active. Hopefully he doesn't rest in Phoenix on Saturday, but Iguodala should be added in standard leagues.

             He scored 13 points in the first quarter and was up to 18 at half on his 7-of-7 shooting. Obviously he's not going to be this good, but this isn't really a big surprise that he went off against the Kings. There is a ridiculous amount of usage to go around, so expecting Cook to score in the teens with some other guard stats is in the realm of possibilities. If you have someone to cut, it's not a bad idea to roll him out there against a bad Suns team on Saturday.

             The Cavs are going to be the most shorthanded they have all year. They would almost have to start both Jeff Green and Ante Zizic for this game while LeBron James, George Hill and maybe even John Holland gets a spot start. Zizic and Green are on the board as DFS plays while basically any available Cav gets a huge boost. By the way, the Cavs canceled shootaround, so yeah we should be in for a wild ride on pre-game news. Not a good weekend for Cavaliers of any kind, apparently.

             He looked to have tweak something on Thursday night, so maybe that explains why he's out. Hood just can't stay healthy right now and he's approaching ""never again"" status in fantasy. Expect all the guards to pick up the slack with Hood and Kyle Korver out.

             It's his 37th birthday, so hopefully he's not going to play in this game for fun reasons. The Cavs are also very shorthanded, so there should be a lot of minutes going to Jordan Clarkson, J.R. Smith and George Hill.

             This win ties the Blazers for the longest active winning streak at 11 to help Toronto hold their five-game lead over Boston. The Raptors also rested Kyle Lowry in this game, and after the game DeRozan said he ""for sure"" felt like he just played his seventh game in 11 days. The Raptors have a back-to-back set coming up on Mar. 20-21, so there's a very good chance DeRozan is out for one of those games.

Siakam has been kind of sneaky good since the break, averaging 8.9 points, 5.1 boards, 2.5 assists, 0.6 steals, 0.5 blocks and 0.5 turnovers in his previous 11 games. That's more like a stream, but he has value in deeper leagues. Although, there's a very good chance the Raptors rest players, which would help him.

             He'll probably have some minutes restrictions, but OG doesn't really get involved in the offense enough to wait it out. Anunoby has been a great story after his ACL tear last year, though.

             We've finally reached the rest portion of the season and the Raptors have to be feeling great about the No. 1 with a five-game lead while the Celtics extremely banged up. Lowry and DeMar DeRozan's minutes should drop, and you can probably bet at least one of those guys will rest on a road-road set for Mar. 20-21. Wright did also close last night and he plays a ton of SG, so it's possible he goes on another one of his heaters. He's worth a look depending on what you're looking forward.

             Brewer has given the Thunder a huge lift since his arrival and has now put together five solid games in a row with averages of 14.8 points, 3.2 rebounds, 1.8 assists, 1.0 blocks, 2.6 steals and 1.3 triples in that span. He has played at least 30 minutes in four of those and coach Billy Donovan is loving his ability to run the floor with Russell Westbrook and Paul George. The bad news for fantasy owners is that the Thunder play just three games in each of the next two weeks.

             Ankle injuries are getting ridiculous in the Bay Area. Casspi rolled his ankle as he stepped on David West's foot, and he was in a lot of pain. He was able to walk to the locker room under his own power, so hopefully he won't be out for long. Nick Young is going to get all he can eat while the other wings play slightly more.

             That's impressive against the Raptors defense and it comes after a 30-point Tuesday night. Barnes hasn't been rested yet this season, but it's possible he gets the night off after so many minutes tonight. As long as he's active, he could have a huge game. For what it's worth, his minutes take a minor hit in back-to-back sets.

             Well, that nine-minute Tuesday looks more puzzling now. Whatever the case, Powell was great in his role against Toronto's size and he should be looking at ample opportunity on Saturday. Plus, Powell was consistently hanging int the 20s before Tuesday night. Before be broke out last month, Powell had one of his best games against the Nets on Nov. 29, so he could be in for a big night.

             Someone wants an allowance from Doc. In all seriousness, Rivers has stepped up for a Clippers team that has been depleted by injuries and March has been his best month yet. He was averaging 16.4 points, 4.1 assists, 3.6 rebounds, 1.1 steals and 1.9 triples in his previous seven games, and he's peaking at the perfect time for fantasy owners. The Clippers also play four times in each of the next two weeks.

             It was his first start since the All-Star break and he looked awesome. The Nets had him run the offense a bunch and he set his teammates up for some easy buckets. Hollis-Jefferson is in a nice groove over his last four, averaging 17.5 points, 8.8 boards, 1.0 steals, 1.0 blocks and 0.5 treys on 58.7 FG% and 80 FT%. RHJ is cooking at the right time and needs to be in all lineups.

             The veteran sharpshooter hit 7-of-13 from the field and 6-of-7 from the line. He's as reliable as it gets from beyond the arc and March has been his best month yet with 3.0 triples per game in that span. The 76ers also play four games in each of the next two weeks, so his fantasy owners should be in great shape.

             It looked like Robert Covington's leg may have hit LeVert's knee, causing him to limp to the bench. LeVert did not go to the locker room and he was shaking it off, so it would appear he's going to be OK. LeVert also closed this game out over D'Angelo Russell. The Nets do play the Mavs on Saturday, so hopefully we get an update tomorrow afternoon.

             He had four fouls, so don't worry about the low minutes. He was in a brutal slump for months, but Covington is suddenly in a rhythm again, hitting 19 of his last 32 shots, good for 59.3%. ""You're not going to know the outcome of the next shot if you don't take it,"" Covington said in regards to shooting slumps. Even if he cools off, fantasy owners know they can always rely on him for his defensive stats and triples.

             He also added three steals in 37 minutes, shooting 10-of-17 from the field and 1-of-4 from the line. Simmons is in the top 20 for minutes per game this season, something that was hard to see coming after he sat out his entire first year with a foot injury. If your fantasy team is punting free throws, Simmons has been a top-20 fantasy asset in standard leagues.

             It was his first game off the bench since November. The move to the second unit was a success with a fast start and Dinwiddie also got the closing minutes over D'Angelo Russell. He'll still be able to find minutes in the 25-32 range basically every night, and now he can run the offense even more. He also did log minutes next to DAR, so Dinwiddie's fantasy owners should feel good about this move.

             Not a bad way to celebrate his 24th birthday. Embiid's shot wasn't falling and he finished just 6-of-23 from the field, but he ended up making all 11 of his free throws. Coach Brett Brown said he wants Embiid to take 6-8 triples per game which is basically double of what he has been doing (he was at 3.4 attempts per game prior to Friday), so that will be quite an adjustment because Embiid leads the league with 9.9 post-up plays per game. If there's a takeaway here, it's that his 3-pointers could go up but it will likely be at the expense of his field goal percentage.

             He's had a low-key breakout year and it looks like Harris is going to reach his goal of making 40 percent from beyond the arc. Coach Kenny Atkinson made it seem like Crabbe should be OK for Saturday, so this game doesn't shift Harris' fantasy value too much.

             His shot was off, but he continues to show he's improving as a passer. With Spencer Dinwiddie moving to the bench, there should be more opportunity to run the offense. Russell's subpar play did cost him minutes late with Dinwiddie and Caris LeVert taking the clutch run. Of course, you're running DAR out there in your lineup every night now.

This game was strong enough to call him a pickup for anyone needing a center in a competitive league.

            Mario Hezonja scored 11 points in 28 minutes against the Celtics on Friday, adding four rebounds, one assist and one 3-pointer.
        
        
             He was a major letdown since the injuries to Evan Fournier and Aaron Gordon. In those five games, he managed to average just 8.0 points, 5.0 boards, 2.0 assists, 1.2 steals and 0.8 treys on 37.0 percent from the field. With Aaron Gordon having a great shot to play on Tuesday and the Magic being off for three days, dropping Mario makes a lot of sense in most leagues.

             Rozier has scored at least 15 points in three consecutive games for the first time in his NBA career and has backed up his claim that he can be on a starter in this league. Marcus Smart underwent surgery on his thumb on Friday and will miss the rest of the regular season, so even when Kyrie Irving (knee) returns in the next game or two, Rozier will be locked into a significant role the rest of the way. We don't love his playoff schedule, but Rozier is a must-own player even with six total games over the next two weeks (after Sunday).

             The Magic were playing from behind, so Birch's minutes dropped from 29 because they had to go small. It's still nice to see he is trusted to play so much power forward, but of course Aaron Gordon should be back on Tuesday to make it a moot point.

             He's still a mess on offense, but Isaac continues to fill it up with defensive stats. He has an upper-respiratory infection and that's why he played just 18 minutes on Wednesday, so an uptick tonight is a positive. That said, he only plays three games next week and he's off for three days, so Isaac is not going to help you too much in the short term because of his unfavorable schedule.

            Jonathon Simmons made 5-of-15 from the field for 13 points with four rebounds, three assists, one steal and one 3-pointer in 34 minutes against the Celtics on Friday.
        
        
             He got off to a really slow start, so he didn't have any carryover from his career-high 35 points on Wednesday night. The best part of Simmons' run is likely over because Aaron Gordon has an excellent chance to play on Tuesday night. Plus, being off for three days is really tough this time of year, so Simmons' fantasy owners may want to see if they can make up some ground with guys playing twice before Tuesday. Plus, Simmons' standard-league upside isn't that great because he's scoring dependent.

            Al Horford (illness) played well in his return to the lineup on Friday vs. the Magic, scoring 15 points with nine rebounds, three assists, one steal and one triple.
        
        
             He finished 6-of-18 from the field and knocked down a pair of free throws. This game wasn't exactly close, so it's a great sign that Horford played 31 minutes. The Celtics only play three games next week and three games the following week, and the offense will continue to run through Horford and Terry Rozier until Kyrie Irving is able to return from his knee soreness.

             An MRI on Friday night confirmed the diagnosis. It's another massive blow for the Warriors and fantasy owners, as KD joins Stephen Curry (ankle) and Klay Thompson (thumb) on the sidelines. Based on this timetable, the earliest we would see KD back in action is Mar. 31 against the Kings.  Nick Young and Andre Iguodala are both worth a look in standard leagues, while Omri Casspi should have some low-end value as well.

             Not good. Durant has already been ruled out for Friday's game vs. the Kings, but his status for Saturday's game vs. the Suns is unclear. The Warriors are just going through the motions until the playoffs get here, so they may continue to be extra cautious. We should hear something later tonight.

             According to team reporter Mike Trudell, Kuzma just went through on-court drills to test the ankle that kept him out of the Warriors game, and will meet with the training staff to discuss how it felt before his availability is determined. If he can't go, Isaiah Thomas would likely start, and IT may even start either way.

            Dante Cunningham is out for the remainder of the game on Friday due to a left eye contusion.
        
        
             He took a shot to the face in the first half and was bleeding, so he won't be returning. The Nets do have a back-to-back set and it could be possible Cunningham is out for that one. Jahlil Okafor had a strong stint in the first half and will likely slot into Cunningham's role.

             He was a game-time call, so George probably isn't 100 percent. Still, there's no word of any restrictions and he's been a second-round player on the season, so put him in your lineups and don't think twice about it. Jerami Grant loses a good bit of streaming appeal with George playing.

             According to the Magic broadcast, Gordon did not pass the final test on the protocol to get him out there. He doesn't appear to be to be on the bench, so maybe he's changing into his street clothes. He should be ready for their next game on Tuesday.

             Wright played strong defense last night and he even closed out against the Pacers, so he should have a good chance at minutes in the upper 20s. This should also open up some wing minutes, but the Raptors will still run two-PG combos. Anyone who wisely streamed Wright in a B2B just got a huge bonus, but he's not an add here.

             Well that's a new one. Prince hasn't shown any signs of being limited in recents games and has been on a tear with 28.3 points per game over his last three with plenty of supporting stats. Assuming he's active, we feel comfortable calling him a must-start player.

             This is a new injury from last night and it would be interesting to find out if it's from the fall he had after Marquese Chriss shoved him. If Rubio can't play, we may get to see more Dante Exum after a solid debut on Thursday. The Jazz also signed David Stockton, so that could be fun in garbage time.

             Yeah, you can probably say his dad, John, was a factor for this move. Stockton was playing in Reno with the Big Horns of the G League, and the Jazz just got Dante Exum back last night. Although, Ricky Rubio is on the injury report now. David only has 15,806 assists to go to catch his dad for the franchise assist record.

Still, if you need a point guard and Harrison is cleared to play, he'll be worth a look.

With Smart out and Kyrie Irving dealing with a knee issue, Terry Rozier will be the man and is likely going to be a difference-making addition to fantasy teams. We'll see some consistent minutes from Shane Larkin while the other perimeter players also benefit.

            Tyson Chandler (neck, shoulder) went through practice on Friday and is day-to-day, according to coach Jay Triano.
        
        
             ""The toll of the neck thing and the shoulder thing, lots of little things bothering him,"" Triano said. It doesn't sound like the Suns will be upping his minutes. He was an option to start yesterday, but he didn't even make the active list. Maybe Alex Len can do something, but he's like a box of chocolates, as Mama Gump would say. Keep an eye on Alan Williams next week, too.

             He was not very good last night, making just 3-of-18 from the field. The tape on his fingers seemed to be bothering him, but Booker still logged 34 minutes on Thursday. He may struggle with his shot and he'll probably be a game-time decision again. If he's out, that should mean more run for Elfrid Payton, Shaq Harrison and Troy Daniels. Josh Jackson should get burn regardless, but he's likely to start.

The Spurs keep secrets better than any team in the league, so it's anyone's guess when Kawhi will be back out there. If you're in a tight fantasy playoff matchup, holding Kawhi could be a detriment right now.

             The Warriors are not going to have their three offensive superstars, so Cook may get a chance. He's played 45 minutes without Kevin Durant, Klay Thompson and Stephen Curry this season. That time in per-36 averages comes out to Cook posting 13.7 points, 2.4 boards, 6.5 dimes and 1.6 treys. Against the Kings, those numbers seem doable tonight.

             Wait, positive injury news? This is new this week. Kidding aside, this bodes well for Richardson to play, and he said on the Heat broadcast he was hoping to suit up for this one. He was originally called doubtful after he didn't play on Wednesday. He'll almost certainly be a game-time call, or the Heat can do their usual ""intends to play"" update later tonight. If he's out, basically the entire rotation benefits.

             As per usual, injury reports before the day of a game are pretty much meaningless, so don't read too much into this. Additionally, Gina Mizell of the Denver Post reports Harris is dealing with a ""sprain/strain"" and not just soreness. That's a little bit of a vague description, but you would think Harris is out for at least Saturday against the lowly Grizzlies. There should be results of his MRI later today, and there really isn't a speculative add to make in most leagues.

Labissiere was trending up before his injury, averaging 11.8 points, 6.6 boards, 2.4 dimes, 1.8 blocks and 0.4 steals in his March games. He should be owned in 12-team leagues while this likely means Zach Randolph or Kosta Koufos sit.

             This is not totally unexpected, as the Warriors are playing the second night of a back-to-back and coach Steve Kerr told reporters he was wary of ""overplaying"" Durant while the Warriors were so shorthanded due to injuries. Golden State will be without their top three scorers: Stephen Curry (ankle), Klay Thompson (thumb) and KD. However, Draymond Green (shoulder) will return to the lineup on Friday and should be in line for a heavy usage rate. Nick Young, Andre Iguodala and Omri Casspi will all see a significant uptick in playing time and scoring opportunities.

Coach Mike D'Antoni should be able to provide some clarity when he addresses the media after Saturday morning's shootaround.

Chicago has no motivation to play LaVine if they are overly concerned with the health of his knee.

             This will be Markkanen's third straight game on the sidelines. After Saturday's contest, the Bulls next game is Monday vs. the Knicks in New York, in what could be a very important game in terms of deciding lottery positioning. We should have an update on Lauri's status by the end of the weekend.

             Dunn injured his toe in Thursday's win over the Grizzlies. X-rays came back negative, and he was listed as day-to-day. However, with the Bulls in tank mode, they have no reason to rush Dunn back into the lineup unless he is 100 percent. Zach LaVine (sore knee) and Noah Vonleh (toe) are questionable for Saturday. Cameron Payne will likely draw the start at point guard. Payne finished with eight points and five assists in 25 minutes on Thursday. Jerian Grant might also re-enter the rotation on Saturday.

             This is terrific news for Turner owners. Speaking with reporters after Friday's game, coach Nate McMillan said Turner had a (dreaded) high ankle sprain. Turner confirming that his sprain is of the low-ankle variety is a huge sigh of relief. Turner was limited in practice on Friday, but there was reportedly no limp or gimp. He told reporters that he was ""pleasantly surprised by the lack of pain."" We should have another update on his status after Saturday morning's shootaround.

             The fact that Turner hasn't yet been ruled out is encouraging. Turner injured the ankle in Thursday's loss to the Raptors and coach Nate McMillan said afterward that Turner is dealing with a high ankle sprain. We should expect an update on Turner's status following the Pacer's shootaround Saturday morning, but it would be surprising if Turner was cleared to play. Domantas Sabonis (ankle) has already been ruled out, leaving Indiana thin up front. Al Jefferson would be the primary beneficiary.

He will be re-evaluated on March 22nd, and we'll get an update at that point.

            Al Horford (illness) will play Friday night vs. Orlando.
        
        
             Horford has missed each of Boston's previous two games, but was listed as probable for Friday and we now have confirmation he plans to return to the lineup. The Celtics remain shorthanded with Kyrie Irving (knee), Jaylen Brown (concussion), Marcus Smart (thumb) and Daniel Theis (knee) all still sidelined. Boston will likely want to use Horford as a focal point of their offense on Friday night, so he should see plenty of scoring opportunities and a high usage rate. Guerschon Yabusele, who started on Wednesday, will head back to the bench.

Guerschon Yabusele, who started on Wednesday, will get bumped back to the bench.

""I'm a two-time All-Star and a starter who has done things that a lot of people in this league haven't done (when) given that opportunity.""

Gobert has been a top-15 player for total value in standard leagues in that stretch, and it's time we start considering him for Defensive Player of the Year despite missing time.

In fact, no rookie has ever hit all four of those marks with Allen Iverson being the closest (missed by 0.4 treys).

             Nurkic got embarrassed by LeBron James early in the game (video below), struggled with foul trouble and just kind of looked dejected while he was out there. Terry Stotts didn't like his body language and pulled him, plus it wasn't a great matchup with the Cavs running Jeff Green at center. Owners can expect a bounce-back performance on Saturday with a much more favorable matchup against the Pistons.

             He's back to being Boston Jae with plenty of treys and with solid usage and minutes in the upper 20s. Crowder hasn't even shot the ball well at just 39.2 percent in his previous March games, so he could get even better. He should be owned in most standard leagues.

             The Trail Blazers ran a lot of small ball lineups which made it tough for Tyronn Lou to throw Zizic out there. He might be seeing limited minutes while Larry Nance (hamstring) and Kevin Love (hand) are out, but he can really only be viewed as a shot blocking streaming in extremely deep leagues.

             It was clear his hand injury was bothering him. Booker's injury is near his right pinkie knuckle, so maybe he can learn to play with it. The Suns also went with Booker at PG for two minutes tonight, so that's something to watch. He'll probably struggle with his shot here, but his owners have to keep plugging him in their lineups.

            LeBron James did all he could to deliver a win for Cleveland on Thursday, but ultimately his 35 points, 14 rebounds, six assists, one trey, two steals and three blocks were not enough.
        
        
             LBJ was a monster from start to finish, throwing down a demoralizing dunk on Jusuf Nurkic early on (link below) and essentially single-handedly keeping the Cavs in the game throughout. Unfortunately, he just didn’t get much help from his teammates, and he also blew a layup with 30 seconds left that could have pulled the Cavs within three. The Cavs have now lost three of their past four games, which has dropped them down to the No. 4 seed in the Eastern Conference.

             Green added one 3-pointer, five rebounds, four assists and one turnovers through 34 minutes of floor time, and he could be looking at minutes in the 30s while Kevin Love (hand), Tristan Thompson (ankle), Cedi Osman (hip) and Larry Nance (hamstring) are banged up. Still, he won't be much more than a low-end guy in really deep leagues.

             The bad, overly passive Hood showed up to this one, and he was really outshined by Kyle Korver. He's likely going to be on a minutes limit a bit longer, and he's just too inconsistent to trust in fantasy hoops; particularly at this juncture in the season.

Even if he moves to the bench, the minutes should be there. Plus, the Suns going back to no-PG lineups is good for Jackson, too.

             The Cavs got him going early, and as an added bonus for 9-cat owners, he didn't turn the ball over once. He's been riding a mini-hot streak over the past three with averages of 17.7 points, 4.0 triples, 3.3 boards and just 1.0 turnover per contest, so give him a look if you need some help in the 3-point department.

             Hill expended a lot of energy chasing around Damian Lillard all night long, which is perhaps why he was so passive on offense, only attempting one shot through the first three-quarters of action. He’s not much of a scorer, but he shoots solid percentages, rarely turns over the ball, and does enough with the dimes and triples to warrant ownership in deep leagues.

Len still hasn't done much with them and basically any halfway decent center has crushed the Suns lately, especially when Len is in. Alan Williams is getting close, so leave Len on the wire unless you want to stream him for Saturday against the Dubs.

He was also really struggling before this stretch, so Payton may be moving into the drop discussion soon. He gets a shorthanded Warriors team on Saturday, so his owners may want to give him one more shot.

It feels like every time people push the panic button on Jokic, he just goes on a tear. There was some concern about his usage drop with Paul Millsap back, but Jokic is rolling again. Over his last five, he's averaged 23.0 points, 10.2 boards, 7.4 assists, 1.6 steals and 2.2 treys on 67.2 percent from the field and 91.7 percent from the line. He'll be a first-round pick next year and his fantasy owners should enjoy the Denver run for a playoff spot.

There was no reason to worry about Barton anyway, but this will help even the biggest worrier feel better.

             There could be a Harris for Harris sub with Gary Harris getting hurt tonight. Devin probably wouldn't be asked to do too much, and it's certainly possible Malik Beasley gets a bump. Devin is only an add in deeper leagues for now.

            Gary Harris (leg) will have an MRI on Friday, but X-rays were negative.
        
        
             He was walking around gingerly in the locker room, but Harris was in good spirits. Coach Mike Malone said it's ""somewhere in the middle"" of his lower leg, so it's tough to say whether or not he'll miss time. Considering how slowly he was moving around, there's a good chance Harris won't be ready to play Saturday. Plus, it's against Memphis, so there could be more Devin Harris to help Will Barton and Jamal Murray.

             The Pistons have won just two games since the All-Star break with wins over the Bulls and Bucks. They have almost no chance to make the playoffs and it's probably time to start wondering if coach Stan Van Gundy is on the hot seat. Worse yet, Drummond broke out this year in his non-double-double stats, so that makes SVG look even worse.

             He continues to step up and he's outplayed Ish Smith a ton. The fantasy takeaway here is that fantasy owners can't trust Smith right now, or maybe Buycks is a tourney option in DFS.

The Pistons are basically out of the playoffs, so maybe they look to Kennard more. His upside isn't high enough to stash him, though.

             Gasol's current stint as a reserve has been an unmitigated disaster for fantasy owners, with three-game averages of 7.7 points, 4.7 rebounds, 1.0 assists and 1.0 blocks in just 13.2 minutes. Playing time is the glaring issue here and it doesn't help that the Spurs have won two straight with LaMarcus Aldridge playing center in a small-ball starting unit. Most owners should try to remain patient -- but if you're in a fantasy-playoff situation, this isn't the time to wait and hope Pau bounces back.

             Murray turned his ankle and the Spurs opted to hold him out of a close game, but he did stay on the bench until the final buzzer. We should have a status update on Friday, until which time we'll list him as questionable for Saturday's game vs. the Wolves. If he does end up missing time, Tony Parker, Patty Mills, Bryn Forbes and maybe even Brandon Paul stand to benefit.

             To put this in perspective, Green's blocks-fest was the most by a Spurs guard since George Gervin in 1977. He shot just 2-of-11 from the field tonight but didn't have any turnovers, and contributed to enough categories that the blocks weren't on an island. This random outburst isn't enough for most owners to change their view of him, however, as he came in averaging just 18.8 minutes in the Spurs' past four games.

             Clark shared the backcourt with Rajon Rondo for 9.5 minutes tonight -- of course, it also helped that Rondo struggled and was himself limited to 24 minutes of action. Clark has scored double-digit points in three straight games for the first time all season but he doesn't contribute much in other categories, and his current streak is based on unsustainable 60.7% shooting.

The Spurs started a small lineup and played Pau Gasol just 10 minutes off the bench, leaving Okafor exposed defensively.

In his previous six games he was averaging 10.0 points, 9.2 dimes, 4.5 rebounds and 1.5 assists, so just keep trotting him out there.

            Nikola Mirotic was back in the starting lineup on Thursday, but he made just 3-of-12 shots to finish with six points, 10 rebounds, one steal and three turnovers in 29 minutes.
        
        
             Mirotic and Emeka Okafor continue to flip-flop roles based on matchups. The more pressing concern is that Mirotic has now struggled in four consecutive games, averaging 7.5 points, 1.0 assists, 0.7 triples, 0.7 steals and 0.3 blocks. He's still rebounding well, and owners have no choice but to play him in the expectation of an offensive revival -- New Orleans plays the Knicks on Saturday, followed by a four-game week.

             He tweaked his wrist and did have his wrist wrapped, but he had an explanation on that after the game. ""It’s just swag,"" Embiid said. ""I just wanted to look swaggy so I thought it was a great look for me. Some type of new swag. That’s why I had it."" Embiid staying healthy this year is one of the best stories of the season.

             Portis did an excellent job of getting into the passing lanes, something he’s been particularly adept at over the past week ripping away 1.7 steals per contest to go with averages of 14.0 points, 8.0 boards, 3.7 dimes and 1.7 triples, and he even bucked his inefficient trend in this one. The shooting percentages will be up-and-down with Portis, but he’s doing enough elsewhere to warrant ownership in all leagues.

             LaVine struggled to get his shot to drop, but he made up for that by constantly getting to the line, and as an added bonus he came through with a steal and a swat. Efficiency has been an issue for him this season, and that might not change as he works his way back into shape after major knee surgery, but with the potential to pop off at any given moment he needs to be owned everywhere. He could be extra busy on Saturday if Kris Dunn (toe) can't play.

             It was a scary injury as his right leg landed awkwardly after a dunk attempt. Harris stood up for about 15 seconds, but then sat back down to have the trainer look at him. He walked off the court very slowly and his body language was discouraging, as well. There's a good chance he'll need an MRI, so we should get a quote after the game. Jamal Murray and Will Barton will be busy.

             Gasol took his time to get going in this one, spending a majority of the game serving as a facilitator rather than a shot creator, but he took over late, rocking a 35.4 usage rate through the fourth quarter of action while scoring 10 of his 21 points. He did tweak his left ankle midway through the fourth, but he played through it and didn’t seem at all limited, so he should be good to go on Saturday against the Nuggets.

            Ben McLemore struggled to stay on the court Thursday, recording just one rebound across eight foul-plagued minutes.
        
        
             Foul trouble was an issue, but Tyreke Evans’ (ribs) return had a lot more to do with McLemore’s lack of production. He had a nice stretch while Memphis was ridiculously banged up, but he’ll slip back to irrelevancy in most leagues with the team getting healthy again.

             Evans did an excellent job of running the floor and he came just one triple shy of matching his career-high in long-range makes, but most importantly, he looked healthy and didn’t hesitate at all taking it right to the rack through contact. Evans also had an epic pro-tank play at the end of the game, fouling Atonio Blakeney on a 3-point attempt with 1.8 seconds left and the Grizzlies clinging to a one-point lead. Blakeney went 2-of-3 from the line and Memphis lost the game.

Both guys have given Houston defensive versatility and rebounding, with competent spot-up 3-point shooting, but their roles could be complicated with Ryan Anderson (hip) aiming to play Saturday. Just keep an eye on the frontcourt rotation if you're relying on any of these guys in deep leagues.

             In an epic showdown with DeAndre Jordan, Capela and the Rockets got the last laugh. There was some pregame confusion with Capela, as the Rockets initially listed him as 'out' with a strained left thumb -- hopefully the mix-up didn't cause him to ride any fantasy benches tonight. He came in averaging fewer points, rebounds, assists and blocks since the All-Star break, compared to his pre-break numbers, but tonight's gem should erase most of that discrepancy. He's been a complete steal for everyone who drafted him.

If Dunn can't give it a go, Cameron Payne could start, and there would be more opportunity for guys like Zach LaVine, Bobby Portis and Denzel Valentine.

             The supporting stats help salvage Milos' line, even though his minutes were dwarfed by starter Sindarius Thornwell (six points, one assist in 37 minutes). The Clippers next seven opponents are all against teams currently in playoff position, so Doc Rivers' faith in his 30-year-old rookie is about to be put to the ultimate test. Most fantasy owners should look elsewhere for reliable value.

            The Clippers fell in Houston on Thursday, 101-96, despite Austin Rivers notching 20 points on 10-of-18 shooting, with three rebounds and three assists.
        
        
             Rivers and Tobias Harris (29 points) provided most of the offense tonight, but it wasn't enough with Lou Williams struggling (14 points on 6-of-18 shooting). This was the first game of a back-to-back set for the Clippers, who now face the Thunder in OKC, but they don't have the luxury of resting key guys -- Rivers played 39 minutes tonight and could see a similar workload on Friday.

             Dorsey was a dud in his first start on Tuesday, with five points, two assists and one rebound in 19 minutes. Kent Bazemore is out for the season and the Hawks don't have many alternatives with DeAndre Bembry (abdomen) also sidelined, so Dorsey should continue starting for the foreseeable future. We're still skeptical that he can reliably produce enough to help fantasy owners.

             Lee had a nice stretch in the second quarter tonight, and finished 5-of-8 from the field with three 3-pointers. He's playing on a 10-day contract and could be cycled back to the G League, but for now his role looks safe with Atlanta's backcourt in shambles. He's worth monitoring as a streaming option in deep leagues.

             Muscala has quietly been getting it done for roto owners since the All-Star break, averaging 9.4 points on 46.2% FGs and 92.3% FTs, with 1.4 triples, 4.6 rebounds, 1.0 steals and 0.6 blocks. Tonight's line would have been better if he made more shots, but ultimately it comes down to playing time -- with John Collins, Dewayne Dedmon, Tyler Cavanaugh and Muscala all sharing the frontcourt, some inconsistency is a given.

             We don't want to jinx it, but Prince is peaking at the ideal moment with fantasy playoffs underway. Over the past three games he's scored 28.3 points with 5.3 triples, 8.0 rebounds and 5.3 assists, which puts him in truly elite fantasy company. He's also one of the only first- or second-year players averaging at least 13.0 points, 4.0 rebounds, 2.0 assists and 1.0 steals, joining Ben Simmons and Kris Dunn, and he won't come cheap on draft day next year.

             Lance Thomas (personal) wasn't with the team to help boost Beasley's minutes in this loss. Beasley is coming off a 21-point game and there's no reason to think the Knicks will dial his minutes back just yet. He should be owned in all leagues.

             The Hawks have lost five straight games but Collins has been solid in that stretch, chipping in just enough points, rebounds and supporting stats for top-100 value -- it helps that he's a very reliable source of percentages. This matches the season-high in scoring he set back on Nov. 20, and the Hawks should only give him more offensive freedom in their final 13 games.

             Coach Dwane Casey went to him later in this game than usual, but there's nothing to worry about here. With their 10th straight win tonight, the Raptors look like they have the No. 1 seed in the bag and now had a five-game lead over the Celtics. This is actually bad news from a fantasy perspective because that means DeRozan is probably getting a night off in April.

             The win gave Charlotte a season sweep vs. the Hawks, who were the perfect foil for a struggling team that lost six of its previous seven games. It wasn't all good for Williams' fantasy owners, as he went 0-of-3 at the line without any defensive stats, but it's a step in the right direction. He came in averaging 6.7 points on 33.3 percent shooting in March, and has been too unreliable for use in most leagues.

             MKG hasn't lived up to most fantasy owners' expectations this season. His stats have decreased in most categories compared to 2016-17, including a career-low 4.2 rebounds per game, but he is shooting 50.9% from the field. That's largely because he's attempted just two 3-pointers all season and exclusively looks for shots near the rim -- all but one of his shots came in the paint tonight.

            Jeremy Lamb (back spams) made 3-of-8 FGs and 3-of-3 FTs for 11 points on Thursday, adding five rebounds, two 3-pointers and one assist in 25 minutes.
        
        
             Lamb was questionable for this game but played through the ailment, and his solid playing time is all the proof you need that he was fine-- Charlotte led by 18 points after three quarters, so there was no need to push him. He should be ready to go vs. the Knicks on Saturday.

             Dunn will end his night with six points, four dimes, two boards, two steals and two turnovers in 25 minutes, and while the severity of his toe sprain isn't currently known, it wouldn't be surprising to see him miss at least a few games with the Bulls playing for Ping-Pong balls. Cameron Payne could be looking at some starts if Dunn misses time, and Jerian Grant might be able to get back into the rotation. Zach LaVine would also see an uptick in usage.

             ""There was a lot of swelling at halftime,"" McMillan said. ""Tried to go. Came out third quarter and was able to play. Reaggravated it and couldn’t return."" That's not good at all, but at least Turner was able to return in the second half. This suggests he's probably going to be out on Saturday, which is too bad because Turner was on fire this month. Al Jefferson could be worth a look as a pickup, but most owners may want to wait until Turner is officially ruled out.

             That's 52 straight games with a steal as Oladipo leads all players in both steals per game and total steals. The Pacers just had two huge wins in Philly and Boston coming into this game, but they couldn't hang with the top-seeded Raptors. That said, there's a good chance Oladipo's team in fantasy is the top seed because he's been an absolute steal.

If Turner can't play on Saturday, Booker may be worth a look in deeper leagues because Al Jefferson can't play 48 minutes. Well, at least we don't think he can.

             He was on fire in the first half with 15 points in 11 minutes, and he kept it going in the second half.

            Myles Turner (left ankle) aggravated his left ankle injury on Thursday.
        
        
             It's quite a timeline on his ankle today: Turner tweaked his ankle at the end of the second quarter, he returned with 10 minutes left in the third, he checked out in the third, he was doing numerous exercises on his ankle throughout the second half, he stood by the bench for the early fourth, and he then rolled his ankle again under the basket down the stretch. Both ankle tweaks didn't look severe, but there's a chance he won't be ready on Saturday. If not, the Pacers are in deep trouble with Domantas Sabonis (ankle) already out. It might be time for some heavy Al Jefferson.

            Updating a previous report, Ante Zizic will come off the bench for Thursday's game in Portland.
        
        
             He was initially expected to start with Larry Nance (hamstring) out, but instead, coach Tyronn Lue will go with a small ball frontcourt featuring LeBron James and Jeff Green. While Zizic will run with the second unit tonight, he has a decent shot of getting minutes in the mid-20s as the only healthy big on the roster and Jusuf Nurkic on the other end of the floor.

            George Hill, Kyle Korver, Rodney Hood (back), LeBron James and Jeff Green will start vs. the Trail Blazers on Thursday.
        
        
             Larry Nance is out with a hamstring issue, so Jeff Green will shift over to the five with Hood getting the start at the three-spot. Hood will be on a minutes limit, so he's not the most attractive target in DFS. Ante Zizic will come off the bench, but he might see decent minutes as the only healthy big on the roster.

             His ankle issue didn't look too bad, but he did have to go to the locker room. It was just a minute before half, so he may have just got a jump to get re-taped. If he's out, Al Jefferson would be the last man standing and he's going off with 15 points in the first half. Trevor Booker would have to help.

             He had a splint on two fingers during warmups, but he ditched it as the session went on. It'll also be interesting to see how he is affected from this injury and he may be apprehensive on shooting. You're obviously starting him in fantasy, but beware of a possible bad shooting line.

He jammed his shooting hand on Wednesday, so that could be a problem for a guy who puts up so many shots. If he's out, expect more Josh Jackson, Troy Daniels and Shaq Harrison.

            Quinn Cook (hand) is probable for Friday against the Kings.
        
        
             He's coming off a solid 13-point Wednesday and he could have even more shots going his way with Kevin Durant (rib) up in the air. Cook could be an option in deeper leagues for a back-to-back set on Friday and Saturday.

            Jordan Bell (right ankle) is probable for Friday's game vs. the Kings.
        
        
             Bell was dealing with a right ankle sprain on Wednesday and he suffered a 'slight' tweak in the fourth quarter, but it doesn't sound like it will keep him off the floor. With David West (arm) also expected back, though, there's not a lot of breathing room in Golden State's frontcourt.

            Kevin Durant (right rib soreness) is questionable against the Kings on Friday.
        
        
             The Warriors are on a back-to-back set here, so that could be a factor for him to possibly sit out. Coach Steve Kerr also dropped a hint that he didn't want to ""overplay"" KD while everyone was hurt. If he's out, the Warriors will have a ridiculous amount of usage to go around to the rest of their rotation.

             That's good news for the Rockets, but he'll likely be eased back into the rotation. Plus, Joe Johnson is another player that could take minutes from him. Anderson probably isn't worth a pickup until he shows he can get enough minutes.

             He did not practice on Wednesday due to a sprained ankle, but this confirms it is minor. Hardaway Jr. has been logging serious minutes with 38.5 per game over his last two, so he may be busy again. Although, he'll probably have to deal with Lord Robert Covington.

             Perhaps this is the last time Collison comes off the bench or maybe he does on Saturday, too. His minutes didn't increase on Tuesday night at just 21, so he will likely fall in the 22-26 range. He's still worth owning in most leagues.

             This was the expected designation for Adams with him going through non-contact work in practice today. It's a big game for the Thunder, so Adams should have a decent chance to play. If not, that means more Jerami Grant and Patrick Patterson.

             The team did change the diagnosis from a groin injury to pelvic strain, but that doesn't mean much. George did some non-contact work in practice today and is probably going to be a game-time call for the 8:00 tip. If he is out, there should be more Corey Brewer, Jerami Grant and Raymond Felton.

His fantasy owners may want to consider dropping him, depending on the situation. Thaddeus Young, Al Jefferson and maybe Trevor Booker (ankle) could pick up a few minutes.

Getting ruled out early is a bad sign, but the Heat are off until Monday as they end their road trip tomorrow. With him out, Bam Adebayo has performed under the boards while both Kelly Olynyk and James Johnson should be owned in all leagues.

He added it's going to be weird that he'll miss time, which makes sense because Klay hasn't missed more than five games in any season. He'll be re-evaluated on Mar. 22 and Nick Young likely starts in his place going forward.

             This is a 180 from this morning when Nance was going to start barring a setback. Well, apparently he had a setback from an injury that was not considered serious. Hamstring injuries linger, so hopefully this is a precaution. Nance was on fire before the injury, so most of his owners should hold here. Ante Zizic will start while we should see more John Holland and small-ball lineups.

            Allen Crabbe (illness) is questionable for Friday against the 76ers.
        
        
             He did not go through practice today and we don't know much else besides that. If Crabbe can't go, Joe Harris could be a candidate to start because coach Kenny Atkinson seems to like playing Caris LeVert and Rondae Hollis-Jefferson together. Basically, the entire rotation would benefit.

             He was expected to play back on Wednesday, and the Warriors will finally have some depth up front. JaVale McGee has done a fine job with added minutes and Zaza Pachulia had a good game on Wednesday, so they take a hit.

             That's good news after he missed Wednesday's game due to his lingering shoulder injury. The Dubs do have a back-to-back with a game in Phoenix on Saturday, so there's a decent chance Green won't be out there for that one. His return takes away from all of the bigs, including the centers because he will play some five.

             This makes sense on two counts: Rudy Gobert is very good. Secondly, if Devin Booker can't go, that can allow Josh Jackson to just slide up to his spot as the shooting guard. This is somewhat bad news for Troy Daniels and Shaq Harrison, and you're not trusting Chandler in almost any league.

             He missed Tuesday's action due to an injury on Monday, and we haven't received much info besides that. Hip contusions can be tricky and Skal Labissiere's fantasy owners can tell you first hand that players can miss a week. If he's out, Jerami Grant would likely be the biggest winner.

             Coach Stan Van Gundy said the practice was ""encouraging."" Jackson is expected to return at some point in the next nine days, but he'll almost certainly have to go through a full practice before he's cleared. The Pistons do have a back-to-back set for Monday-Tuesday, so maybe Jackson has a chance for one of those. Ish Smith's value is a ticking time bomb and he can be dropped soon.

Still, he should get enough shots to use in standard leagues.

Allen was dominated by Joel Embiid in their last matchup and he played just 16 minutes, so there is some risk involved here. We also know how cautious the Nets are with their best players, so Allen may have restrictions. Dante Cunningham and Quincy Acy will lose most of their value if Allen is cleared.

             He jammed his hand at Wednesday's practice, and while the injury wasn't considered serious at the time, Booker was spotted shooting with his off hand at the morning shootaround. Booker said he'll ""try to play,"" but Suns reporter Scott Bordow said that may be wishful thinking. If Booker can't go, Shaquille Harrison and Troy Daniels will likely both get a significant bump in minutes. Harrison has multiple-category upside, while Daniels is a one-trick pony for his 3-point shooting.

             He's not traveling with the Suns for Thursday's game vs. the Jazz, so this is a way for Williams to get reps before he makes his season debut on Saturday vs. the Warriors. Williams could be a nightly double-double threat with just around 20 minutes per game, but he'll likely have restrictions out of the gate.

I think that he could probably do it any time he wanted, but I'm not sure that it's needed at this moment."" This would reportedly by a ""minor"" procedure as a follow to his 2015 surgery, but the good news is that Irving is expected to be close to 100 percent for the playoffs.

Even though the Warriors were shorthanded, Bell only played 18 minutes with six points, three boards, two assists, one steal and one block because coach Steve Kerr wanted to be conservative with his workload.

             Steve Kerr said before tipoff that he was ""not going to overplay"" Durant to compensate for the absence of three injured All-Stars, but he still logged 35 minutes tonight. That's particularly worth remembering due to the Warriors' upcoming back-to-back set on Mar. 16-17. Durant got hit in the midsection in the first half tonight but he played through it, so that shouldn't influence his status going forward.

             Golden State likely wanted Zaza more involved as a veteran presence on a team that was missing three starters, so he overtook JaVale McGee at center tonight. He's now posted two straight double-doubles for the first time since Jan. 2016, but we're not placing bets on him getting three in a row vs. the Kings on Friday.

             Iguodala wasn't on a strict minute-limit, according to coach Steve Kerr, who still opted to take a conservative route with his 14th-year veteran. Iguodala took just one shot tonight and didn't get to the free throw line -- he was cruising prior to the wrist injury, though, and is worth monitoring in deeper leagues.

Still, he's a viable streamer while the Warriors are this banged-up.

Most fantasy owners assumed BroLo would cruise early and fade after the All-Star break on a young, rebuilding team, but he's flipped that narrative on its head -- through seven games in March he's averaging 19.0 points on 57.3% shooting, 2.0 triples, 4.0 rebounds, 2.1 assists, 1.1 blocks and 0.7 steals.

             In the midst of his best stretch in the NBA, Randle said he's ""numb"" to rumors that L.A. will jettison him in favor of two max free agents this summer. Randle admitted it would be ""tough to say no to L.A.,"" and coach Luke Walton heaped praise on him, saying, ""[H]e's playing unbelievable basketball ... He's a matchup nightmare."" The Lakers can match any offer in restricted free agency, so ultimately the ball is in their court. Expect him to keep increasing his value while Brandon Ingram (groin) and Kyle Kuzma (ankle) are sidelined.

That said, Hield has been wildly inconsistent on offense lately -- in his previous four games he scored 20, zero, 18 and three points. He was cruising in late February and still belongs in active lineups, despite the roller-coaster ride.

             Koufos ceded the starting job to Willie Cauley-Stein but fantasy owners should be pleased that he continues to suit up night after night. The threat of DNP-CDs was initially reduced while Cauley-Stein (back) was out, and now it's Skal Labissiere (hip) who continues to miss games. The risk is palpable, but Koufos is paying off for owners who've gambled on him in March.

             This marks the most efficient shooting display of his young career (64.3%), and he committed just one turnover in 35 minutes of action. He came in averaging 9.5 assists in his previous two games, and he's typically a reliable source of steals, but inconsistency and rough percentages (41.3% FGs, 73.7% FTs) have dragged down his value all season. Even in the NBA's official points-league system he's just top-120 in March, but he's trending in the right direction.

Miami's starting five hadn't played a single minute all season before tonight, and this was the 22nd different starting unit coach Erik Spoelstra has used this season, which is part of the reason guys like Johnson have been hard to track for fantasy purposes. It makes sense to ride him while he's hot, though, especially with Miami very short-handed.

             Tatum played through lower back tightness, which was crucial for a Celtics team missing three starters and a pair of key reserves. ""I think it's just stuff that you deal with over the course of 67 games,"" coach Brad Stevens said before the game. Tatum spun past two defenders for a contested dunk in the second quarter, alleviating concerns about his back, but we'll keep an eye on him anyway -- back injuries can linger, and this was a career-high in playing time for Tatum.

             It's no coincidence that Morris' high-water mark came with Boston decimated by injuries tonight, and his scoring kept Boston competitive. He did make a horrible play leaving Jodie Meeks open in the corner for a game-tying 3-pointer, but that won't impact the veteran going forward -- he's bound to have higher minutes and usage until Boston gets healthy bodies back. Most owners should roll with him through the weekend, in the hopes that he stays hot.

            Shane Larkin couldn't play in the second overtime period on Wednesday due to a minute-limit, according to coach Brad Stevens.
        
        
             The Celtics' key players were exhausted late in tonight's game and could have used Larkin, who finished with 11 points, four assists, two steals, one rebound and one 3-pointer in 24 minutes. He battled a sore right knee in February and has yet to play more than 24 minutes all season, so this doesn't impact his fantasy value (or lack thereof).

             The Celtics had 10 healthy players in uniform due to the absence of Kyrie Irving (knee), Jaylen Brown (concussion), Al Horford (illness), Daniel Theis (knee), and Marcus Smart (thumb). Yabusele stepped up with the opportunity and was impressive as a playmaker, showing vision and a deft touch for a 260-pound forward. Despite this solid performance, the 'Dancing Bear' could drop out of the rotation again with Horford aiming to play Friday.

             In three previous starts, Rozier had averaged 19.7 points, 8.0 rebounds and 5.7 rebounds, including one triple-double. Tonight's boxscore-stuffing production was incredible regardless of fantasy format, and he's likely carrying some owners through the playoffs. He's also made multiple 3-pointers in 11 consecutive games, and should continue to feast with Marcus Smart (thumb) out indefinitely.

Porter's smart drive-and-dish to Jodie Meeks helped force the first overtime, and he used the extra periods to finish with his best overall fantasy line in March. In addition to multiple career-high averages this season, Porter has missed a mere three games due to injury.

             Satoransky navigated foul trouble to carve out a decent line for fantasy owners, but the bigger issue is the pending return of John Wall (knee). Wall went through an ""extensive workout"" on Tuesday and can be viewed as day-to-day at this point, although sitting out on Saturday would give him four days' extra rest before Wednesday's road game in San Antonio. Either way, the clock is ticking for Satoransky.

             Mahinmi had six boards on the offensive end, and he was huge in the early stages of this game, producing easy buckets after an awful start. He's had two strong games in a row but tends to cool off as quickly as he heats up, so we're viewing him skeptically while Marcin Gortat is healthy.

             The Wizards were down 21-6 against a skeleton crew for the Celtics, but they woke up behind a stellar effort from Beal. It was almost like he realized Boston was playing without five key rotation players and couldn't stop him one-on-one. He wound up playing 47 minutes in the double-overtime road win, and was understandably exhausted -- when asked how he felt afterward, he referenced his injured All-Star teammate -- ""First off, John [Wall] better hurry up."" Fantasy owners may not share that sentiment.

Although, it'll be interesting to see if the team does want to give Khem Birch more run. Regardless, Vooch's owners can keep plugging him in until further notice.

He's been a treat to watch on defense and was coming into this week as a 75th percentile defender (Synergy), but the matchup against Giannis Antetokounmpo was way too tough for him. Khem Birch actually took Isaac's late minutes and Isaac continues to struggle on the offensive end. Isaac still has some appeal for his blocks, but only playing in one game over the next five upcoming days may make it tough to hold him.

            D.J. Augustin scored a season-high 32 points during a win over the Bucks on Wednesday, adding three rebounds, four assists, two steals and six 3-pointers in 36 minutes.
        
        
             It was a shooting clinic for the Magic with a season-high 18 treys to tie a franchise record at home. Augustin scoring 30 is rare air with this being just his fourth 30-plus scoring game of his career, and just the second game with even 20 points this season. Augustin seems to have a grip on the first-unit job and the Magic aren't going to their no-PG lineups anymore, so he's a fine option despite a lack of games on the horizon.

             The Bucks defense didn't show up a night after the Magic scored just 72 points last night, and coach Joe Prunty had an explanation. ""Horrible effort,"" he said. Antetokounmpo continues to be used at the five more, and Prunty put his star player in earlier than usual to cause him to hit the 40-minute mark. On the whole, Giannis' usage rate since the break is down at 29.8 compared to 31.7 before All-Star. Maybe the Bucks will feed the freak more often.

             That's better after a discouraging Friday and Monday with only 26 minutes per game in those two wins. Excluding injury-related games, that down set was the first time he didn't hit 30 minutes in consecutive games since Jan. 10. The Brandon Jennings signing likely won't affect Bledsoe as he continues to post early-round value.

             Not great after the 16/8/12 line in his season debut on Monday. Jennings only had a three-minute stint in the first half, but he had two fouls and was roasted on defense. His value looks like it's tied to Eric Bledsoe more than anyone else, which hammers home the point that his big Monday game had a lot to do with Bledsoe's foul trouble. Jennings should be better than this and there is an opportunity, but this was obviously a reality check. It's likely a bumpy ride and most owners probably won't want to deal with that.

            Damian Lillard's first child is due Monday and if his girlfriend goes into labor on Sunday, he could miss Sunday's road game vs. the Clippers.
        
        
             It sounds like Lillard will play in Saturday's home game regardless. He does plan to travel with the Blazers for Sunday's game, but his status obviously won't be known until the weekend. Shabazz Napier will be a very popular streaming play if Lillard does miss a game.

             The Dancing Bear is loose and is out of hibernation. This should be fun with Yabusele capable of doing a lot of things on the court for passing, shooting and bring defensive stats. He's only played 110 minutes all year, but he'll have a chance for career-highs in some categories. He's a risky play in DFS, but he's an option with the Celtics so thin up front.

Harrison also had a big brace on his wrist at the Memphis Hustle game, so he's likely not close to on-court work. Tyreke Evans (rib) possibly coming back on Thursday should mean guys like Kobi Simmons lose most of their value.

             Well, this is a surprise after the Grizzlies have been ruling Evans out early for a couple weeks. He could still miss more time, but this could indicate he's getting closer to a return. The Grizzlies probably don't want to lose 20 in a row, so maybe that's a factor. He's an option as a pickup, but most owners may want to wait to see he is a go before taking up a roster spot.

After tonight, the Magic only have one game in the upcoming five days, so Gordon's fantasy owners aren't going to get much out of him this week. It'll be Jonathan Isaac starting at PF while the rest of the starting unit has more shots going their way, too.

That could mean Labissiere's owners may want to hold him for Friday. While he's out, there should be more run for Zach Randolph and Kosta Koufos, but there's still risk that they rest, too.

             He went through a closed practice with the G League team as part of the last stage of his rehab. It was his second rehab practice this week and he'll be questionable to play on Thursday against the Suns. Leave Exum on the wire, but this is great to see he's getting close to a return.

             That's all we know for now, and we may get an update later today. The NBA injury reports have been brutal lately, so hopefully Booker doesn't wind up on the sidelines. For now, assume that Booker is going to play against the Jazz.

             It's a new injury for Lamb, who has cooled off a bit this month. In his previous March games, he averaged 12.2 points, 2.0 boards, 0.8 steals and 1.0 treys. The Hornets have hinted they may tweak their rotation at some point in March, so maybe they take it easy on Lamb.

             He was out there down the stretch for some defensive possessions on Tuesday night, so this likely is minor. Booker would also be looking at more minutes because Domantas Sabonis (ankle) is already out. If Booker can't go, Thaddeus Young may get more run while Al Jefferson, Glenn Robinson III and Bojan Bogdanovic could play slightly more.

His fantasy owners may have to figure out if they want to wait for him to return, but dropping him is an option. Thaddeus Young, Al Jefferson and Trevor Booker (ankle) could play more. Myles Turner should continue to roll.

             It's being called soreness and perhaps this helps explain why Richardson played 16 minutes on Monday. He's started all 68 games this season and has been Miami's most reliable player. If he's out, that means Justise Winslow, James Johnson, Tyler Johnson, Rodney McGruder and Wayne Ellington would get more minutes. McGruder is probably the best bet to start.

            Domantas Sabonis (ankle) is questionable for Thursday against the Raptors.
        
        
             His ankle sprain didn't look good on Tuesday, but X-rays were negative. The Pacers didn't practice today, so we probably won't get an update on his status until tomorrow morning. If he's out, Trevor Booker should get a few minutes while Al Jefferson would play some backup five.

             He played 23 minutes in a start on Tuesday to push Michael Beasley to the bench. Thomas only scored three points with little else, so he's not a fantasy option anyway. If he's out, that could help Courtney Lee get a few more minutes along with other guards.

             He's been out for over a week with his injury from last Tuesday, but the Warriors did call him probable for yesterday. If Iguodala can't go, the Warriors are likely going to have lean on Quinn Cook, Shaun Livingston and Nick Young more than they ever thought. We'll probably see more two-big lineups at the four and five, too.

             This means that Thompson won't play again this week, and he could be looking at a multi-week absence here. Owners currently battling in the playoffs without an IR-spot and limited roster space may need to seriously consider cutting Klay. Kevin Durant is going to be ridiculously busy tonight with Stephen Curry (ankle) and Draymond Green (shoulder) also unavailable, and there will be more minutes for Nick Young and Omri Casspi. Young is worth a speculative add in deep leagues.

             It sounds like Thompson won't be taking the floor on Wednesday against the Lakers, and Marcus Thompson of The Athletic reports that the thumb injury isn't just a ""day-to-day"" thing. The Warriors could be very shorthanded tonight with Stephen Curry (ankle), Draymond Green (shoulder) and David West (arm) already ruled out, so Kevin Durant's usage could go into the ridiculous range. Nick Young and Omri Casspi will also pick up some extra minutes if Thompson is out.

            Dante Exum (shoulder) has been sent down for another G-League stint.
        
        
             The Jazz aren't practicing today, so Exum will go down to the G-League to get in some extra work. He's on the cusp of a return, but he's also going to be the third-string point guard on the roster, so there's no reason to stash him.

             It looks like Markkanen is set to spend his second straight game on the sidelines, which could result in Noah Vonleh earning another start, but it's Bobby Portis who will benefit most in his absence. There will also be more shots for Kris Dunn, Zach LaVine and Denzel Valentine. After Thursday's game, the Bulls return home for a game against the Cavs on Saturday, and for now, we'll be considering Markkanen questionable for that one.

             CP3 missed time with a left knee issue earlier in the year, so if there's any hint that he's not 100% after shootaround on Thursday, the Rockets may want to play it safe and keep him out despite him saying he's fine. James Harden would shift back to the one with Eric Gordon sliding back into the starting five if Paul sits, and Gerald Green could pick up some extra minutes. Stay tuned.

            Marcus Smart will receive a second opinion on his injured right thumb on Thursday.
        
        
             The issue at hand is whether Smart is dealing with a full tear to a ligament in his right thumb or a partial tear. He's prepared to play through the pain if it's a partial tear and playing through it won't cause any additional damage, but if it's a full tear he will require surgery, which would put him out for roughly 2-3 months. Even if he's able to avoid surgery, he likely won't make it back to the court until the postseason, so there's not much incentive to hang onto him in most settings. Terry Rozier is now a must-own player.

             Hood missed his second game in a row on Tuesday, but did say he'd ""probably"" be ready to go by Thursday. Kyle Korver got the start with Hood on the sidelines Tuesday night and went off for 22 points in 23 minutes, so he might stick as a starter even when Hood gets back in order to help keep Hood's minutes low. Korver is worth a look in deep leagues, while Hood isn't really worth rostering through the injury in most scenarios.

             We had a report on Monday stating that Love was targeting a return in 2-3 weeks, and next Friday's game against Phoenix would put him slightly ahead of that timetable. It's worth noting that it's not a sure thing Love will be back on the 23rd, but he's close enough that he warrants a stash for those with a bye week. It could take him a handful of games to shake off the rust, but given that this was just a hand injury, it shouldn't take long for him to get his conditioning where it needs to be. Larry Nance's value could take a hit upon Love's return.

             He picked up his third foul midway through the second quarter, so that explains the low minutes. The Nuggets dropped to 10th place in the West with this loss, but on the bright side their schedule softens up quite a bit -- they have games coming up against the Pistons, Grizzlies and Bulls over the next week.

            Dragan Bender was good for seven points over 24 minutes in Tuesday's 129-107 loss against Cleveland.
        
        
             It was a forgettable night for Bender and most of the Suns. He ended up just 2-of-9 from the field, including 1-of-5 from downtown. He was able to salvage the fantasy stat line somewhat with five boards, three assists and a blocked shot, but it wasn't nearly enough. He also had a minus-24 rating on the night, as all five starters were minus-20 or worse. Bender will look to get back on track Thursday, but he and his teammates face another tough matchup in Utah.

             He led all Nuggets in minutes played, a surprise for a player that missed a game last week with a hip injury that has been bothering him for a while. He added 10 rebounds, four assists, two steals and four triples in what was arguably his line of the season, but his strong play is nothing new. Even before this outburst, Chandler was averaging 13.3 points, 5.8 rebounds, 2.6 assists and 1.5 triples since the break.

             Reed scored just two points while adding a rebound, as even the lopsided nature didn't get him heavy minutes now that Devin Booker (triceps), Josh Jackson (knee) and T.J. Warren (back) are healthy and able to play again. Reed has promise for the future, but he can mostly be left to the waiver wire in most fantasy formats.

             Harrison moved back to the bench with Devin Booker (triceps) back in action, but he didn't pout and responded well. He hit 4-of-6 from the floor while chipping in with a rebound and a steal. The good news is he appears to have found a home in Phoenix after playing well during his two 10-day contracts. The bad news is that his fantasy appeal is rather minimal.

Millsap was able to salvage his night with five rebounds, two assists, one steal and two blocks, but look for him to bounce back against the Pistons on Thursday.

As long as the Suns are healthy, Daniels is a reserve and his minutes will be limited to 20 or less. As such, his fantasy appeal is limited to the deepest leagues.

             He was coming off a career-high 36-point effort vs. the Cavaliers and kept his foot on the gas tonight. Randle hit 11-of-17 shots, but it wasn't all good as he was 4-of-7 from the free throw line with four turnovers. His floor is much higher these days because Kyle Kuzma is playing small forward with Brandon Ingram sidelined, so Randle is locked into big minutes for at least one more game -- Ingram will be re-evaluated on Thursday.

             Booker missed Saturday's game in Charlotte due to a triceps strain, as he was having difficulty raising his arm. It obviously loosened up enough for him to play, but he was just 7-of-16 from the field, and 0-of-3 from behind the arc. He was either rusty after the one-game layoff or still hurting. Either way, as long as he is active he is a must-start fantasy option.

             Warren hit 8-of-17 from the floor while snagging 10 rebounds for his first double-double since Dec. 29 in Sacramento. It was also his first double-double in front of the home fans since Nov. 22 against Milwaukee. After missing the past two games due to back spasms he appeared to play with no restrictions or pain. It's safe to plug him back into the active fantasy lineup in leagues allowing daily moves.

             Ball was 1-of-7 from beyond the arc and missed a pair of free throws, but to his credit, he was productive in other areas with nine rebounds, eight assists, three steals and two blocks. This was his second game in a row hitting just 2-of-11 shots, but his across-the-board production gives him a nice floor in fantasy. Ball's first 3 was a timely one in the fourth quarter tonight and he ended up playing 41 minutes, and it's going to be interesting to see if the Lakers rest him on Wednesday for the second night of a back-to-back.

             He also had the highlight of the night when he put Nikola Jokic on skates on his way to the hoop. Thomas finished 7-of-19 from the field and 5-of-6 from the free throw line, adding four rebounds, two assists and four triples. If the Lakers rest Lonzo Ball on the second night of a back-to-back on Wednesday, Thomas will be poised for a monster night.

He was able to salvage the stat line with six rebounds, two assists and two blocked shots. He'll continue to have a role until Rodney Hood (back) is on the shelf. However, Hood might be back as soon as Thursday, killing Holland's already mild fantasy appeal.

            Jordan Clarkson finished with 23 points across 27 minutes off the bench in Tuesday's 129-107 victory in Phoenix.
        
        
             Clarkson was a solid 8-of-14 from the field, including an impressive 6-of-10 from behind the 3-point line, while adding two steals and an assist with just two turnovers. As long as Rodney Hood (back) is sidelined Clarkson will see a healthy amount of minutes. He remains a solid fantasy option, as he continues to lead the NBA in baskets by a reserve.

            Kyle Kuzma (ankle) returned from an injury scare in Tuesday's 112-103 win over the Nuggets, scoring 26 (10-of-20 FGs) points with 13 rebounds, two assists, one steal and five 3-pointers.
        
        
             He tweaked his ankle after a dominant 16-point third quarter, and while it was ""clearly bothering him"" according to Lakers reporter Mike Trudell, Kuzma returned in the fourth quarter and responded with back-to-back 3s. There's a chance his ankle could swell up overnight, so we'll put him on the injury report for Wednesday's game vs. the Warriors. He was already playing mostly small forward with Brandon Ingram on the shelf, so the Lakers will be in trouble if he misses time and would need to use a committee approach to soak up his minutes. For now, we're expecting him to play.

             Zizic seized the opportunity, going 5-of-5 from the floor while adding four rebounds, a blocked shot and a steal. Larry Nance Jr. (hamstring) left the game, forcing him into a larger role. If Nance is forced to miss additional playing time, Zizic could see some additional run.

             Kyle Korver made the start with Rodney Hood (back) still sidelined, and head coach Tyronn Lue said Korver will continue to start over Smith until Hood is healthy enough to return. Smith came off the bench Tuesday in Phoenix and scored 15 points in 22 minutes, but most of his production was in garbage time. We'll get a better idea of Smith's role in a closer game, especially if and when Hood returns.

             Korver was on fire, hitting 6-of-7 from the field, including 5-of-6 from behind the 3-point line, and he was a perfect 5-of-5 from the free-throw stripe, too. He also added four boards with an assist and just two turnovers. He moved into the starting lineup with Rodney Hood (back) still sidelined, and J.R. Smith will be relegated to the bench for the foreseeable future. However, head coach Tyronn Lue said Hood will start when healthy, and that might be as soon as Thursday in Portland, so Korver's fantasy bump is short-lived.

             Green hit just 4-of-12 from the field, including 1-of-3 from behind the 3-point line, but he added four rebounds with three steals and three blocked shots while finishing with a plus-18 rating to salvage the fantasy stat line. Green has been forced into a starting role with injuries to Rodney Hood (back) and Cedi Osman (hip), but he isn't seizing the chance. He is shooting just 9-of-32 (28.1 percent) from the floor over the past three outings. He'll try to get back on track Thursday in Portland.

             LeBron also added three steals and two blocked shots with a game-best plus-23 rating, hitting 7-of-14 from the floor. He did most of his damage from the free-throw line, going 13-of-15 there. The King is averaging a triple-double since Feb. 9, posting 28.5 points, 10.2 rebounds and 10.0 assists per game. Next up is a trip to Portland on Thursday night.

            Kyle Kuzma rolled his right ankle awkwardly on a drive to the basket at the end of the third quarter and hobbled to the locker room.
        
        
             He was ballin' with 18 points and 11 rebounds, and while the replay didn't look terrible, it was not a normal twisting of the ankle, as it was more inverted than a traditional roll. He returned from the locker room with about 10 minutes left in the fourth quarter and it looks like he's available to return. Crisis averted?

Hopefully that means he will be ready for Wednesday's game vs. the Blazers on the second night of a back-to-back, but if not, look for Ante Zizic and Jeff Green to pick up run. Nance finished with four points, two rebounds and one block in 14 minutes.

             Ingles lead the charge offensively through the first half of action, helping Utah put up a season-high 42 points in the first quarter alone, and he did an excellent job of balancing his shot taking with his playmaking. He also was a perfect 2-of-2 from the charity stripe, and as an added bonus for 9-cat owners committed just one turnover.

             Rubio popped off for 30 points on Sunday, but he spent more time in his natural facilitator role tonight, and overall, Utah's ball movement was quite superb in this one. While the scoring tends to come and go with Rubio, he's pretty consistent with the boards, dimes and steals, and he could realistically finish the year as a top-50 player.

             Mitchell added three triples, nine boards, three dimes, two steals and four turnovers through 31 minutes of floor time, but he wasn't his usual aggressive self on the offensive end with Joe Ingles and Rudy Gobert going bonkers. He also missed a few wide-open looks, and Utah never really needed him to take over with the game being a massive blowout. We'd expect a higher scoring outing on Thursday vs. Phoenix.
