            Donovan Mitchell scored 24 points and had four rebounds and nine assists in 34 minutes before heading to the locker room with a left foot injury after a collision with James Harden in the fourth quarter in Utah’s Game 5 loss to Houston on Tuesday.
        
        
             Mitchell was going insane in the third where he scored 22 of his 24 points. He never returned to the action, but did come sit with his teammates through the final buzzer. ""Even though I was out, I can't just sit in the back,"" Mitchell said. ""I want to be there with my teammates throughout the entire thing."" He was seen in a walking boot for precautionary reasons, but X-rays were negative, so hopefully he just has a minor foot injury. We're wishing a quick recovery for Spida D, who had a phenomenal rookie season, averaging 20.5 points, 3.7 rebounds and 3.7 assists per game. It appears that Ben Simmons is likely to win the Rookie of the Year Award, but given how well Mitchell performed in the playoffs, as well as the regular season, that might be the wrong call.

             This was the most minutes Burks logged all season and the most points he's scored since December 4th, 2017. Even with his big night, it wasn't enough to avoid being eliminated. This was another decent season for Burks, averaging 7.7 points and three boards per game as a role player for the Jazz, who he's set to return with in 2018-19.

             Despite Toronto taking the No. 1 seed out East this season, the Cavs easily brush them off in just four games, so Dwane Casey's days are likely numbered as the head coach of the Raptors. His offense wasn't exactly innovative, and he made questionable decisions with the big man rotations, so his departure would be good news for Jonas Valanciunas. Assistant coach Nick Nurse will be in the running to take over, and Jerry Stackhouse will also likely be a name that comes up.

He served as the Magic's interim head coach for 30 games after they fired Jacque Vaughn in 2015. He then headed back to San Antonio. Charlotte finished last season with a disappointing 36-46 record, despite having one of the league's highest payrolls.

Despite not being suspended, Hood will likely remain out of the Cavs rotation the conference finals.

            Jerry Stackhouse and Mike Budenholzer are potential head coaching candidates for the Pistons, according to Vincent Ellis of the Detroit Free Press.
        
        
             Stackhouse spent five seasons in Detroit during his playing career, and twice represented the Pistons in the All-Star game. An up-and-coming coach, he may be considered the odds-on favorite to land the Detroit job. Vincent Ellis also tweeted out that the Pistons may look to bring in former Cavs GM David Griffin as the team's next general manager.

             The Pistons parted ways with Van Gundy on Monday. SVG was serving as both head coach and President of Basketball Operations. ""When it came down to this, I was perfectly willing to only go in one role and to give up the front office and go into [just] coaching,"" said Van Gundy. ""I didn’t fight to hang on to that at all. I was more than willing to just move over into the [coaching] role."" SVG also said he'd like to coach again if the right situation presented itself.

             Hood has been awful this postseason, averaging just 4.6 points on 39.6 percent shooting. He hadn't played at all in Game 4 on Monday until the Cavs were up 30 with under eight minutes remaining. Coach Ty Lue told him to check in for LeBron James, but Hood refused. According to the report in The Athletic, Cavs GM Koby Altman intends to meet with Hood soon to discuss why he refused to go into the game and to get his side of the story. We should have an update on this situation on Tuesday. Hood could be fined or suspended.

            Kyle Lowry had 10 assists and four rebounds but only scored five points in 30 minutes during Toronto's Game 4 loss to Cleveland on Monday.
        
        
             This was the first time Lowry scored in single digits this postseason and tied for his fewest points of the season when playing at least 30 minutes. Lowry was having a good series up to this game, but being in a 3-0 hole may explain the lack of intensity.

             Going back to Ibaka is a strange decision given his struggles, but the Raptors will be able to increase the pace with this lineup. Jonas Valanciunas will head back to the bench and his role is completely up in the air, while Fred VanVleet should still see a good chunk of minutes off the bench if his shoulder continues to hold up.

             He's dealing with the same injury as Ricky Rubio and the Jazz will be without both guys with their season on the line. Exum was averaging minutes in the low teens in this series, but has had some nice defensive moments on Harden. Look for a combination of Raul Neto, Alec Burks and Royce O'Neale to pick up the slack.

             He was ruled out a few hours before tip-off for Game 4, but now he's getting ruled out a full day before. There's no word of any setback, but this is rough news for a Jazz team that will also be missing Dante Exum, one of their best options to defend James Harden. The Jazz will have to get creative and we should see a heavy dose of Royce O'Neale again.

             Exum exited Sunday's game with the hamstring injury and did not return, and if both he and Ricky Rubio (hamstring) are unable to play Tuesday, that would open up a lot of minutes for Raul Neto and Alec Burks. Neto would likely draw the start, but Burks would make for the more interesting play in fantasy hoops.

""Just kind of taking that same role that I have this year and just expanding it."" Rumors regarding the Heat shopping Hassan Whiteside have been heating up, and if he does get dealt this summer, that could open up a lot of minutes for Olynyk. He was able to produce late-round value in just 23.8 minutes per contest this season, but if he could regularly earn minutes in the 30s, he'd have a solid shot at top-75 value.

Adebayo isn't sure if he'll play more PF or center next season, but that hinges on what the Heat do with Hassan Whiteside. Adebayo played 96% of his minutes at center, so a Whiteside trade would obviously give Adebayo's value a significant boost.

His option is worth $8.8 million, but if he opts out he can probably find a multi-year deal with a similar annual salary. ""On the court, it’s very different,"" Gay said of his time in San Antonio. ""It’s the epitome of team basketball. Everyone is playing for each other, and it’s always been that way."" Maybe the Spurs bump up Gay's workload if they can't repair their relationship with Kawhi Leonard, but it's hard to imagine Gay being more than a late-round fantasy asset if he stays in San Antonio.

            Donovan Mitchell fouled out of Utah's Game 4 loss on Sunday with 25 points, nine rebounds, four steals, two 3-pointers and two assists in 38 minutes.
        
        
             Mitchell scored 13 points in the second quarter but was held in check otherwise, finishing 8-of-24 from the field with three turnovers. Houston's elite defense has allowed a mere 103.0 points per 100 possessions in the playoffs, trailing only the Warriors, and they've mostly contained Mitchell since his Game 2 assist splurge. With the Jazz facing elimination on Tuesday, he'll need more help from teammates -- especially if Ricky Rubio and Dante Exum can't play due to their hamstring injuries.

             Jae Crowder took over the starting PF spot and Favors was used as a strict backup center tonight, but the Jazz lost anyway and now face elimination with a 3-1 series deficit. Favors did fare well during his time on the court, hitting both of his field goals and posting a plus/minus rating of +14 in a game Utah lost by 13 points. The matchups vs. Houston in this series have erased him as a DFS option, whether or not he's starting Game 5.

             Burks couldn't duplicate his success from Games 2 and 3, in which he averaged 15.5 points, 4.0 rebounds and 3.5 assists. He had a bad stint in the first half and coach Quin Snyder only played him for 3:54 in the second half, despite the absence of Dante Exum (hamstring). He burned plenty of DFS owners tonight but could fare better on Tuesday if Exum is ruled out.

             Derrick Favors was dealing with a left ankle injury but Crowder might have started anyway, since the Favors/Rudy Gobert frontcourt has been exposed by the small-ball Rockets. This was Crowder's first start since joining the Jazz and he was obviously awful from the field, including a 1-of-7 mark from deep, so it will be interesting to see if coach Quin Snyder sticks with the lineup for a must-win Game 5 on Tuesday.

             O'Neale hurt his right knee after colliding with Clint Capela in the first quarter, but he returned after getting the knee wrapped in Utah's locker room. He made a few poor decisions down the stretch which are forgivable -- we're talking about a 24-year-old rookie who has averaged 28.3 minutes in the series, more than he played in any month of the regular season. Tonight's knee injury shouldn't endanger his status for a potential elimination game on Tuesday.

             Anderson came in averaging just 6.7 minutes per game in the series, with his role dwindling in each game, so it's no surprise to see him rooted to the bench. Mike D'Antoni has used him as a strict backup-C against Utah, and tonight it was Nene absorbing all of those minutes. Anderson may fare better in different matchups if the Rockets advance in the playoffs, but he's not a DFS option.

             CP3 was celebrating his 33rd birthday and his mid-range game was cooking tonight, resulting in his best shooting performance of the series. He mixed it up with fans during the game and his lone turnover came on a bizarre attempt to sell a foul on Joe Ingles, but his court game spoke for itself. Houston is one win away from the Western Conference Finals and they can advance with a victory at home on Tuesday.

             Exum was injured during a drive to the hoop and he quickly headed to Utah's locker room. We can only hope that the oft-injured guard didn't suffer a serious setback -- he's in the midst of a strong playoff series, taking full advantage of the absence of Ricky Rubio (hamstring). If Exum does miss Game 5, Raul Neto and Alec Burks should absorb his minutes.

             Holiday added seven rebounds, three assists, one 3-pointer, one steal, one block and two turnovers while he was out there, but he struggled to get his shot to drop from long-range (1-of-4 from beyond the arc), which was a team-wide trend with New Orleans hitting just 15.4% of their 3-point shots. Their 4-of-26 shooting from 3-point territory was their worst such performance of the season, and they'll need to do better in all areas to have a chance of pulling out a win on Tuesday.

            Anthony Davis posted a 26-point, 12-rebound double-double during Sunday's Game 4 loss to the Warriors, adding one assist, one steal and two blocks over 40 minutes.
        
        
             Davis also committed an unfortunate team-high six turnovers in the loss, and as a whole, the Pelicans turned over the rock 19 times which lead to plenty of fastbreak opportunities for Golden State. New Orleans now finds themselves sitting in a 1-3 hole, which is something that only 11 teams in NBA history have been able to bounce back from.

             Green now has over 800 career-postseason rebounds, joining Wilt Chamberlain and Nate Thurmond as the only other Warriors in franchise history to accomplish such a feat. His defense against Anthony Davis (8-of-22 from the field) was excellent, and he also finished with a team-high plus-minus rating of +28. After getting embarrassed in a 19-point loss to the Pelicans on Friday, the Dubs bounced back with a 26-point blowout win of their own, and are now just one win away from advancing to the Conference Finals.

             This was Curry's 78th post-season appearance, passing up Jeff Mullins for the third-most playoff games in Warriors' history, and he now trails just Draymond Green (89) and Klay Thompson (90) for that No. 1 spot. He also finished 8-of-17 from the field, 4-of-9 from distance and 3-of-3 from the charity stripe, so this was a solid bounce-back performance following Game 3's 6-of-19 shooting outing. Andre Iguodala replaced JaVale McGee in the starting five in this one, and Steve Kerr confirmed after the game that he'll be going with the same starting group for Game 5 on Tuesday.

            Kevin Durant put up 38 points on 15-of-27 shooting during Sunday's Game 4 win over the Pelicans, adding nine boards, two triples, five assists, one steal and one block across 36 minutes.
        
        
             The 38 points accounted for a 2018 post-season high, and he was also a perfect 6-of-6 from the charity stripe as the Dubs took a commanding 3-1 lead in this second-round series against New Orleans. It's true that the Warriors blew a 3-1 lead during the 2016 Finals, but this Pelicans team just doesn't seem to have the firepower to realistically have a chance of coming back. Golden State will look to close out the series at home on Tuesday.

The Jazz were hopeful to get Rubio back this evening and he was upgraded to questionable on Saturday, but he's getting ruled out a few hours before tip-off which suggests that he's not as close as they thought. Donovan Mitchell will continue to run the offense, but has had his struggles in this series.

             The Warriors will roll with their ""death lineup"" of Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson, Iggy, Kevin Durant and Draymond Green. JaVale McGee was ineffective as the starting center in Game 3, so a change was expected. This lineup combo had a 116.3 defensive rating and struggled on the glass this season, so we'll see if coach Kerr's decision pays off.

             Smith had four fouls, so that kept his minutes down anyways. After scoring a combined 35 points in Games 1 and 2, Smith was scoreless (0-of-2 FGs) in Game 3. ""He was sick [Saturday] and he wasn’t supposed to play but he came in and gave us his best effort, which is big,"" Lue added. Game 4 is on Monday, so hopefully he'll feel a little better as the Cavs attempt to sweep the Raptors.

A team source is optimistic that Rubio will play according to Tim MacMahon of ESPN, but the team will have a better idea after he receives treatment in the early afternoon. Donovan Mitchell has been forced to play out of his comfort zone at point guard, so getting Rubio back would be a huge lift for the Jazz.

""I feel like I can be a three-level scorer, getting to the rim, mid-range and three-point shots."" Winslow can play multiple positions and even showcased an ability to play point forward for Miami, a position he wants to play more of in 2018-19. His shooting percentages were up across the board, but he'll need to expand his offensive game and improve his efficiency to become a reliable fantasy contributor.

             He also admitted to deferring to Dwyane Wade on offense when he arrived, but plans to be much more involved in 2018-19. One of his offseason goals is to improve his ball handling because he wants to play in isolation situations more. Richardson was one of our favorite preseason targets and shattered his ADP with top-35 value in standard leagues. Both Richardson and Heat president Pat Riley said there’s no reason he cannot average 18 points per game, so expectations will be high for the 24-year-old wing.

            Monty Williams is reportedly one of the frontrunners for the head coaching position in Milwaukee.
        
        
             Mike Budenholzer is also considered a frontrunner. With Giannis Antetokounmpo just scratching the surface, this is arguably the most desirable opening in the NBA. The report adds that the Bucks have had interest in Williams and Budenholzer for a long time, and both are expected to meet with the franchise within the next few days.

            Doc Rivers is nearing an agreement for a multi-year extension with the Clippers.
        
        
             While the Clippers failed to reach the postseason, owner Steve Ballmer believes that Rivers did an ""amazing"" job this season with the amount of injuries they had. Rivers said last week in an interview that he loves where the organization is at right now, so it sounds like he's excited to be part of their rebuilding process -- that's a bit ironic because one of the reasons he left Boston was that he didn't want to rebuild at the time. With DeAndre Jordan expected to opt out, the Clippers will have lots of cap space and could be very active on the free agent market.

            LeBron James hit a buzzer-beating shot to defeat the Raptors 105-103 win in Game 3 on Saturday, finishing with 38 points, six rebounds, seven assists, three steals, one block and one 3-pointer in 41 minutes.
        
        
             Coach Ty Lue had a bold call after a timeout with eight seconds left, choosing to have the Cavs bring it out at the baseline 94-feet away to allow LeBron to get a head of steam and hit a nine-foot floater off the glass at the buzzer to earn this win (video in link below). This was LeBron's second buzzer-beating shot to earn a win this postseason to make him the only player in the last 15 seasons to have multiple game-winning shots at the buzzer in one postseason. It's also the fifth time he's hit a postseason buzzer-beater since 2009. James hasn't missed a game yet in 2017-18, and he has an excellent chance to play more than 100 games combined in the regular season and postseason in his 15-year career -- he's hit exactly 100 twice. If he hasn't passed Michael Jordan for the GOAT status yet, it may not be much longer.

             His third-quarter output was key with Love scoring nine consecutive Cavs points while LeBron James was on the bench for seven of those, which gave LeBron some rest. Love's post-up game is back and he may have played his best defensive game of the postseason. Make it two strong games in a row after a 31-11 game on Thursday, so he looks to be back in All-Star form. The Cavs are dangerous finally.

             He really needed help in the backcourt with both DeMar DeRozan and Fred VanVleet making a combined 5-of-21 from the field with only one trey in this loss. Lowry has been productive in each of his last four games, but his teammates can't seem to string games together. It'll be interesting to see what happens to the Raptors after they get knocked out of this series.

             He had a terrible first half with just three points before halftime and he never got it going. DeRozan didn't even close this game out as he was on the bench for the final 14:16 because he was playing so poorly, so this one will sting for much of the offseason. The Raptors could be making some changes this offseason.

             He was not effective in the first half, but Ibaka made some plays on the second half with blocks and scoring in the paint to keep the Raptors in it until the last play. Before fouling out with 15 seconds left, he did also close this game out as the five man as the Raptors made a comeback, so he may be back in coach Dwane Casey's good graces. Encouraging game aside, there will be plenty of risk in using Serge in DFS for Game 4.

             He had some good looks on 3-pointers, but he couldn't knock them down. VanVleet also made some defensive mistakes and brought help defense too soon a handful of times, but he still closed this game out in a small-ball lineup. Additionally, FVV didn't take any pressure off DeMar DeRozan or Kyle Lowry while they were on the court together. While FVV had a +14, this move was not a good one with how much DeRozan struggled, so the Raptors may change it again in Game 4.

             Something had to be done here after the Raptors were crushed in their own gym. Ibaka was arguably the worst player on the team in the last two games, so coach Dwane Casey will go bold here. The Raptors will basically try to outscore the Cavs here, but the interesting part will be how their second unit works. VanVleet should get 25-30 minutes today while this also helps Delon Wright.

             No turnovers for the second straight game and his two steals were arguably the biggest two of the game, especially the one at the end of regulation after the 76ers botched a play that led to the Celtics lead before Marco Belinelli's shot at the regulation buzzer. Rozier has been much better at home, but he's shown he is capable of being a special player. He's arguably a top-five player from the 2015 NBA Draft class.

Tatum has been as silky smooth in this whole series and he made some key defensive stops. This makes matters worse for the 76ers because Markelle Fultz isn't even in the rotation while Tatum is tearing the 76ers' hearts out.

             This one will sting in the 2-1-5 for a very, very long time as the 76ers are now down 3-0. At the end of regulation, Marco Belinelli did hit a game-tying fadeaway at the buzzer, but the 76ers operations staff fired off the confetti prematurely. The game had to be on hold because of the confetti falling for about seven minutes, and the 76ers did get an early lead in the extra frame. However, the 76ers made mistake after mistake after mistake as coach Brad Stevens just schooled coach Brett Brown. No team has ever come back from an 0-3 hole in NBA history, so the Philly fans may have some trust issues with how this pans out.

            Ben Simmons scored 16 points with eight rebounds, eight assists, one steal, two blocks and four turnovers in 43 minutes during a Game 3 overtime loss to Boston on Saturday.
        
        
             Coach Brad Stevens has his number right now. Simmons hasn't been able to take advantage of mismatches and the defense collapsing on him late has limited him. Simmons also had a wide-open missed dunk in the fourth quarter, which may have proved costly. He will be Rookie of the Year for the regular season, but he hasn't played like it in the last two games. Contrary to what the Jazz fans may say, Simmons is a rookie after all.

            Ricky Rubio (hamstring) is questionable for Sunday against the Rockets in Game 4.
        
        
             He did some agility drills, jogging and got some shots up on Friday, but there's no word of him going through a full practice. Usually, teams like for injured players to go through some contact the day before a game, but the circumstance is a little different with the Jazz needing a win on Sunday in a big way. If Rubio does come back, Royce O'Neale, Alec Burks and Dante Exum would lose minutes. For now, Rubio would likely be limited at best.

             He suffered a minor tweak on Friday and was ruled out for a return in the second half, but the Jazz were getting blown out. Favors has a slew of knee injuries in his career and he did tweak his right ankle earlier in 2018, but this one is different. Even if he's healthy, his minutes will be cut due to the bad matchup. Jae Crowder is still in play for DFS.

             He played 25 minutes in Game 2, but he was dealing with soreness and tightness in that win. Brown also went against the doctors' suggestion, so he likely won't be 100 percent again. Marcus Smart should see heavy minutes after a terrific outing on Thursday.

Pierce joins a growing list of candidates that includes Jay Larranaga, Stephen Silas, Jarron Collins, James Borrego, Ime Udoka and Nate Tibbetts. The Hawks aren't exactly in win-now mode, so hiring a coach with an emphasis on player development will likely be a priority.

             Casey said he's given ""a lot"" of thought about tweaking his lineup, though he wouldn't specify what he had in mind. An obvious move would be to bench Serge Ibaka, as he has a combined 11 points in this series on 3-of-13 shooting while bringing nothing to the table on defense.

             It's been a little over 12 months since Porzingis skipped his exit meeting with the Knicks and that relationship hasn't ""fully repaired"" according to ESPN's Ian Begley. This is a smart move by Fizdale to make sure that he's on the same page with New York's franchise player. Porzingis is eligible for a five-year, $157 million contract extension, but Begley adds that it's unclear if they will offer him the deal while he's injured. As of right now, Porzingis' timetable is a bit murky.

             All's well in H-Town again. The Rockets scored 70 points in the first half, which hasn't happened in a Rockets playoff game since they dropped 70 back in 1987. Although, this Rockets team has dropped 70 with some regularity, going 5-0 in those instances during the regular season. As for Harden, this was one of his worst games on the stat sheet this postseason, but he's done a great job taking care of the ball lately with just 2.0 turnovers per game over his last five. The Rockets have a 2-1 lead and could take a commanding lead with another win in Utah on Sunday.

He was tremendous on defense and there's a strong correlation with Capela blocking shots and wins with Houston now going 25-0 when he had three-plus blocks in a game during the postseason and regular season. He doesn't get enough credit as one of the best centers in the NBA.

He'll be highly scoring dependent, but Gordon could be a DFS play now that he could be out of his cold spell.

             He was horrible in the first half, making just 1-of-10 from the field as the Jazz fell behind 70-40. The Rockets get a lot of credit as they defended screens much, much better and Clint Capela owned the paint on Mitchell's patented crafty finishes. The similarities with Mitchell and Ben Simmons both flopping in the last two nights is something, especially with how a lot of it is due to opposing adjustments. Either way, Mitchell should bounce back on Sunday in front of the home folks.

             He was also on James Harden a lot in this game, and he has been the primary defender on him more than any other Jazz player. O'Neale's minutes were supposed to take a hit with Alec Burks and Dante Exum thriving in Game 2, but O'Neale was too hot to limit in the PT department. He'll have a tough time matching this output on Sunday, but he's still in play in DFS.

             He took a step back after two strong games with 21 points in Game 1 and 15 in Game 2. Crowder could be looking at additional minutes in Game 4 with Derrick Favors suffering an ankle sprain in this loss. He may not start because coach Quin Snyder would likely use Jonas Jerebko, but Crowder would be the guy you want in DFS.

             The Rockets finally learned something that the Thunder couldn't get as they defended Ingles along the 3-point line. Ingles was overachieving in this series and him hitting 104 eFG% in Game 2 likely won't happen again, so expect more lines like this one compared to his 27-point explosion from Game 2.

             The Jazz are getting run out of their own gym, so ruling him out doesn't really matter. Favors is not going to have an effective series with the Rockets spacing the floor basically on every possession. If he is limited, Jae Crowder would benefit the most while there could be some Ekpe Udoh behind Rudy Gobert.

             It looked like the Warriors were going to keep The Brow in check early with AD only scoring three points in the first quarter. He added just eight more in the second quarter before he exploded in the third to put this game out of reach. He and Rajon Rondo were clicking in a big way with Rondo hitting AD with an assisted bucket seven times -- New Orleans scorers were generous with some of those assists, though. The Warriors were doing a great job of keeping him out of the restricted area in Game 1 and 2, so they'll have to figure out how to get their strong defensive rotations back. As everyone knows, AD can erupt regardless of how good the defense is. We have a series.

             Playoff Rondo is rolling again. He set the franchise record for dimes in a postseason game and is the first player since himself in 2011 to have 20-plus assists in a playoff game. Rondo's usage has been higher than expected with double-digit field goal attempts in each game in this series, but this time he struggled with his shot with a 2-of-11 line from the field. His minutes are soaring after a tough Game 1 and he hasn't been a defensive liability lately.

             He's completely turned it around after a disappointing 11-point Game 1 with this gem and a 24-point Tuesday. Holiday was also very effective on the defensive end with several possessions on Kevin Durant in this impressive win. Holiday did set the bar extremely high with his 27.8 points per game in the Blazers series, but maybe he can still get to 20 per night in a much tougher matchup.

             Revenge game? Clark was a weak link at time while with the Warriors and the team didn't bring him back on a minimum, and instead they went after Nick Young. While this was not a garbage-time special as Clark helped the Pels extend their lead in the third, he only scored nine points in the previous two games in this series with only six minutes in Game 2. He'll be a dicey DFS play on Sunday, but congrats if you punted with him today.

             His shot was not falling, making 6-of-19 from the field as the Pelicans defended him much better than they did in Game 2. Curry also played 15 minutes in the first half, but he would've likely played more in the second half had coach Steve Kerr not went to the garbage-time lineup at 4:59 left in the fourth quarter. The Pelicans were also really going after him on defense, which explains the high steal/block total. Curry was adjusting his knee sleeve at times during this game and he may not be all the way back, but he has a great chance for a breakout game on Sunday.

             His 20-point second quarter is the most he's scored in a playoff quarter in his career, topping his signature 19-point fourth in Oklahoma City a few years ago. Thompson wasn't very effective besides that quarter and overall he hasn't done much outside of scoring in these playoffs with his seven boards as the most he's had in the postseason. He'll likely need to score 25-plus points to have value in DFS.

             The Warriors fell behind early and not even going to the Hamptons Five lineup (Iguodala, Curry, Durant, Klay, Draymond) for the final four-plus minutes of the first half could help them get going. They used that lineup for nine minutes in Game 2 and it worked, and this lineup combo could be an option to start Game 4.

Coach Steve Kerr did not use this combo in Game 2 and did use it for 34 minutes during the regular season with great success (+48.0 net rating), but it didn't work today early in the third. Looney could be an option to start because JaVale McGee likely won't be staying in the first unit. It's also worth a mention that Looney did see minutes in garbage time.

She's still viewed as the fourth assistant on the Spurs with the three ahead of her all getting interviewed, as well (Messina, Borrego, Udoka). While it would be a great story and she almost certainly will be a coach one day, Hammon is still very new at coaching and may have to earn her stripes for a little longer. Although, she was a smashing success in Summer League a few years ago with a title.

             Well, so much for using Kevon Looney or the Hampton Five. The Warriors will likely only use McGee for the start of the first quarter and perhaps the start of the third if all goes well. This is slightly bad news for Kevon Looney, but he's still an option in DFS. The same for Iggy, too.

             ""A little sore, a little tight, that’s about it. After recovery and ice I’ll be fine for Saturday,"" Brown said. He came off the bench for 25 minutes of action and looked good for the most part, but Brown was limping at times due to his hammy. Additionally, he said he went against the advice of team docs about playing. He could be limited in Game 3, which could give more run to Marcus Smart.

             With David Fizdale off the market, teams like the Hornets should have a better idea of who will run their team during game action. Both Borrego and Larranga are top-five candidates in this coaching class and chances are both will be the head man of two teams next season.

            The Wizards are interested in re-signing Mike Scott, but have limited cap space this summer.
        
        
             Scott exceeded expectations this season. He appeared in 76 games and averaged 8.8 points while shooting a career-best 52.7 percent from the field and 40.5 percent from downtown. With three max contracts on the books (John Wall, Bradley Beal and Otto Porter Jr.), Washington is dangerously close to bumping up against the luxury tax threshold. They may also choose to prioritize defense over offense off the bench.

            Nikola Jokic's agent said that Denver picking up Jokic's team option for next season would be ""an unfavorable scenario for Nuggets.""
        
        
             Because he was a second-round pick, the Nuggets have a team option of just $1.6 million for 2018-19. However, if they pick up that option, Jokic can become an unrestricted free agent in 2019. If the Nuggets decline the team option this summer, he becomes a restricted free agent and Denver can lock him into a max extension. That is logical, likely outcome.

The Milwaukee job is arguably the most appealing and sought-after opening in the league right now due to the opportunity to coach Giannis Antetokounmpo into his prime.

            Joel Embiid made 8-of-22 from the field for 20 points during a 108-103 loss in Boston during Game 2 on Thursday, adding 14 rebounds, five assists, one steal, one block and one 3-pointer in 37 minutes.
        
        
             He struggled with his jumper in this game, making just 2-of-9 shots from outside the paint and 3-of-6 at the line. On defense, the Celtics clearly are doing their best to keep Embiid away from the rim and it's been working, especially now that Aron Baynes is making corner treys. Embiid's 37 minutes are the most he's played in 2018 and he'll likely be close to 40 again in Game 3 on Saturday.

             He earned plenty of Ben Simmons' minutes in the third and fourth quarters, but coach Brett Brown went back to Simmons to close. In hindsight, it may have been a bad idea because of the 76ers struggling down the stretch. McConnell will be in the rotation, but he may not hit this minute total in Game 3.

             Coach Brad Stevens has put together an effective plan to keep Simmons at bay. The Celtics continue to sag off him in a big way and they've been able to keep a body right on him at the rim. Simmons also missed several shots in the paint and was clearly passive with the low attempts from the field. Coach Brett Brown has some work to do.

             Those 14 dimes match his playoff career-high and he was ridiculous with his shot making to ice this one, hitting a whopping seven fadeaway jumpers in the second half (ESPN). The Cavs take both games in Toronto to get a 2-0 lead, and LeBron is 21-0 when he has a 2-0 lead in the postseason and now he has two games coming at Quicken Loans Arena. James has ended the Raptors season in each of the previous two years, and now it looks like it'll be three in what is looking like a sweep.

             Hey, there he is. His 31 points today are more than he had in his previous three games combined (28), and he went to the line seven times after not going there at all in the previous three games, too. Coach Ty Lue wanted Love out there to space the floor and that play worked extremely well as the Cavs were able to get their offense rolling. If this version of Love keeps showing up, the Cavs should be headed to the NBA Finals again.

             He had some foul trouble early in the third quarter, but coach Dwane Casey kept Lowry in there. Lowry's offensive game was just fine, but he didn't get enough help while the Raptors were getting gashed on defense. DeMar DeRozan had another subpar game with 24 points on 11-of-23 from the field while Casey put him on LeBron for several possessions in the second half. The Raptors are in deep trouble.

Ibaka has been late on everything for defense and he missed all five from the field on offense today. He was brutal in Game 1 and coach Dwane Casey has to consider taking him out of the starting lineup after this dud.

             The two sides were reportedly close to a deal yesterday and they got it done today. Fizdale was one of the better assistant coaches in Miami and had a great rapport with his players there before things went south in Memphis, so his experience may help the team sign some free agents. Presumably, the Knicks will give him a longer leash than the Grizzlies did to start this past season.

As for his offseason plans, Giannis hopes to work on his footwork with Kobe Bryant and improve his jumper. As fantasy owners know, Giannis is a 3-point shot away from becoming unfair.

             Boylen is currently the associate head coach in Chicago on Fred Hoiberg's staff and has held that position since 2015. The Hornets have interviewed several candidates for the job including Jerry Stackhouse, Ettore Messina, Ime Udoka, David Fizdale, David Vanterpool and James Borrego, but there's no clear frontrunner right now.

Control what you can control and the rest will take care of itself.’ Our communication has been really good. We’re both going in the same direction. And that’s important."" Gasol's relationship with former coach David Fizdale soured, but Gasol and Mike Conley both have a strong bond with Bickerstaff. He coached a team that was committed to tanking in 2017-18, but we'll see if he can turn things around in Memphis.

If the Grizzlies don't use their mid-level exception worth around $8.6 million, the most they will be able to offer is $3.9 million because they don't have his bird rights.

Coach Brad Stevens said he wasn't sure how much Brown would do during shootaround, but added that he will come off the bench if he's available. Boston will roll with the same starting five, so expect to see a lot of Marcus Smart regardless of Brown's status.

             Young may not earn $14 million per year if he opts out, but securing another long-term deal would make sense with the forward entering his age-30 season. Pacers GM Kevin Pritchard said Young indicated that he wants to return during his exit meeting, and we'd expect the feeling to be mutual.  He averaged 1.7 steals per game which helped him return mid-round value to go with 11.8 points, 6.3 rebounds, 1.9 assists and 0.7 triples.

             Harden erupted in the second quarter and headed into halftime with 21 points including 10-of-11 freebies, which kept Houston within single-digits. He picked up two quick fouls in the third quarter and couldn't quite regain his rhythm after that, however, with Utah's defense holding the Rockets to just 24.0% shooting in the fourth quarter. They threw multiple looks at Harden with aggressive play from Royce O'Neale and Dante Exum, in particular, and we're expecting more of the same as the series shifts to Utah tied 1-1.

             Ariza is prone to disappearing during games and tonight it happened early, with zero stats to his credit until 6:05 was left in the second quarter. Solid minutes help prop up Ariza's fantasy appeal, and the same can be said for P.J. Tucker (five points, 10 boards in 33 minutes) -- Ariza, Tucker and Luc Mbah a Moute are all in the bottom-20 for usage in the playoffs (among 131 qualifying players). That leaves a pretty low ceiling while Houston's go-to guys are healthy.

             Gordon went 0-of-6 from the field in Game 1 but he's never been shy offensively, and he finished as one of four players in double-figures for Houston. None of his bench mates joined him as the second unit shot a combined 7-of-25 from the field (28.0 percent) -- they'll need more supporting production to reclaim homecourt advantage with a victory in Utah on Friday and/or Sunday.

             Utah dropped 36 points in the first quarter and weathered a third-quarter rally from Houston to claim an impressive 116-108 road win. Small-ball lineups were a key for the Jazz tonight and Exum played his part, including sticky defense vs. James Harden, a pair of unlikely 3-pointers, and an explosive dunk to pad the lead late in the fourth quarter. If nothing else, he's likely solidified his spot in the rotation until Ricky Rubio (hamstring) is healthy.

             Mitchell shot just 6-of-21 from the field but showed no signs of the minor ankle injury he suffered in Game 1. He had five assists before he got into the scoring column, which incidentally came after Kobe Bryant released a video breaking down Mitchell's game and encouraging him to pass more -- Mitchell said on Wednesday that he'd already watched the video twice. He battled some foul trouble but stepped up when it mattered most, including a ridiculous follow-up dunk in the fourth quarter (see video below). Thanks to a stellar effort at both ends from the Jazz tonight, the series heads back to Utah tied 1-1.

He's been a welcome source of production without Ricky Rubio, though, averaging 11.3 points in just 18.7 minutes over the past three games. He'll be in most winning DFS lineups tonight and may also be making a case for minutes next year, with Utah owning him a guaranteed $11.5 million.

             O'Neale was tasked with slowing down James Harden and he did a commendable job, even though the MVP candidate still went for 32/11/7. O'Neale's usage rate is a paltry 10.5% in the postseason, which ranks 125th out of 131 qualifying players, so DFS owners are really relying on his defensive stats for value. As long as Ricky Rubio (hamstring) is sidelined, though, O'Neale should continue to get 28+ minutes in a starting role.

            Joe Ingles hit multiple career-highs with 27 points and seven 3-pointers on Wednesday, shooting 10-of-13 from the field with three boards and two assists in a thrilling Game 2 win at Houston.
        
        
             Ingles came in hot with 11 of Utah's first 18 points, and he continued to scorch the nets in the second half. He got a lot of good looks and that will likely be a focal point for Houston as they prepare for Game 3. His scoring also masks a dearth of DFS production -- with zero steals or blocks and limited boards and assists, he finished with a mediocre 30.6 fantasy points tonight. That's still good enough for 4x value, though.

             The Suns spoke with roughly a dozen candidates for the job, but appear to have settled on Kokoskov, a former coach with the Pistons, Suns, Cavs and Jazz. He's also coached Luka Doncic with the Slovenian national team, which is an intriguing angle as Phoenix prepares for a monumentally important draft this summer. We'll get a better feel for the fantasy implications during training camp and the preseason, but Kokoskov is reputed to be particularly good with guards, so that bodes well for Devin Booker and whoever else is manning the backcourt in 2018-19.

             The 38-year-old guard will opt out of his $4.5 million salary to hit the open market. Crawford only signed a two-year deal with Minnesota and he apparently would like to play for more than one year, or he believes he can fetch a bigger deal. He was a good fit with the Wolves and could return there, as well, especially since Jimmy Butler has reportedly been lobbying management to retain Crawford.

             The Knicks have a lengthy list on their candidates to take over as the head man, but they're reportedly getting close to making a decision. Fizdale never got a fair chance with Memphis on a team that overachieved in 2016-17 with him at the helm, so he remains one of the best candidates available.

That starting lineup in Game 1 also got thumped with a -47.5 net rating, but Lue still wants to give it one more chance, apparently. Love has really struggled this postseason and it could be due to his hand, but he'll likely be looking at big minutes again.

McMillan didn't seem too worried about Turner's post game as much and stressed how the center position changed so much recently. Turner was a letdown in his 2017-18 season, but there's still a chance he can trend up again at just age 22.

McConnell as the backup for now, but he averaged just 9.3 minutes in the three games that Fultz didn't play.

             He'll be on the books for $7.9 million and will hit the open market during the summer of 2019. Darren Collison is still under contract, so expect Joseph to reprise his role as the primary backup PG. Joseph averaged 7.9 points, 3.2 assists, 3.2 rebounds, 1.0 steals and 0.8 triples for the Pacers this season, playing 27.0 minutes per game across all 82 games.

             Holiday has looked like one of the top point guards in the league for most of the season and it's nice to finally see him fully healthy and balling out. It may not matter how well the Pelicans play in this series, as the Warriors look unbeatable, despite a nonchalant walk through the Spurs in Round 1, and they got Steph Curry back tonight. Games 3 and 4 are in New Orleans on Friday and Sunday, and the Pelicans are basically in a must-win situation for both of those games.

The Pelicans tried to slow the pace and all five starters put up nice numbers tonight, but they still couldn't hang with the Warriors. Playoff Rondo hates his nickname, but there's something to it. His free throw and shooting percentage tonight say it all, not to mention the rest of his gaudy stat line.

             Davis was great, as usual, but the Pelicans are going to have their hands full trying to play on both ends of the court with the Warriors, who got Stephen Curry back tonight. Of course, AD's left shin was being attended to at halftime tonight and could be a problem going forward, but with elimination at the hands of the Warriors likely looming, our guess is he'll play if he can walk. He's powered through injury flare ups all season and should continue to do so.

             He also had six turnovers, and if there was any rust in his game tonight, the turnovers were the only place it showed. He hadn't played since March 23 against the Hawks, and missed (most of) the seven games before that one with his injury, sans a two-minute run on March 8 against the Spurs. With Curry healthy, the Warriors look like they're setting up for a Western Finals matchup with the Rockets, which the world is anxiously awaiting. The Warriors have a 2-0 lead on the Pelicans with Games 3 and 4 set for New Orleans on Friday and Sunday. Welcome back, Steph.

             Stephen Curry returned to action tonight, but Thompson and Draymond Green still got all the touches they wanted. For Thompson, his shots just weren't falling in this one. His usage rate will certainly take a hit with Curry back out there, but he was coming off of 27-point and 24-point performances, and he would have been there again had his shot been falling. He's fine.

             Durant was brilliant tonight and really turned it on in the fourth quarter, when the Warriors put the Pelicans away, despite a very late run by the Pelicans to make the final score of 121-116 a little more respectable. Durant hasn't been shooting it well from downtown and was just 14-of-52 coming in during the playoffs, and hit 2-of-7 from deep tonight. That puts him at 16-of-59 this postseason (27%), but he's too good a shooter to be held down for much longer. The combination of the Warriors defense and offense has been too much for the Pelicans in Oakland and they'll try to right the ship in New Orleans on Friday and Sunday.

             He was negligible in this one, as LeBron James is clearly the Cavaliers' full-time point guard in the playoffs, as well as most of the regular season. Maybe the plan worked, as the Cavs stole a 113-112 overtime win to take a 1-0 lead in the series, but guys like Kyle Korver, J.R. Smith, Jeff Green and Tristan Thompson, and not Hill, stepped up for the Cavs.

             He finished with nine points and a 3-pointer on 2-of-7 shooting in just 15 minutes. He returned late and missed a wide open 3-pointer that likely would have won the game for the Raptors, as there was less than a second remaining when the play was over. Then in overtime, the Raptors went back to FVV for another 3-point attempt with Jeff Green in his face and just 3.4 seconds on the clock. He missed that one, as well, and the Cavaliers stole a win in Toronto, along with home-court advantage. VanVleet's shoulder injury could linger and he might even be iffy for Thursday's Game 2, so watch for updates if you're thinking about using him in any fantasy games.

             DeRozan was guarding Kevin Love at times late in the game and it didn't work out too well for the Raptors, as Love was crashing the boards and hit a big 3-pointer. DeRozan did have a great block on a Love hook shot attempt, but was then blocked himself on the other end, negating the play. DeRozan took a hard, inadvertent Love elbow to the jaw in this one, but was able to stay on the court and finish the game. Outside of the third quarter, DD and the Raptors played well and probably should have won Game 1. They'll look to bounce back on Thursday night.

            Kyle Lowry hit 6-of-12 shots and three 3-pointers for 18 points, three rebounds, 10 assists and a steal in Tuesday's overtime loss in Game 1 to the Cavaliers, but didn't score in the fourth quarter.
        
        
             Despite the Raptors hitting just 5-of-24 shots and missing 11 (or 12) straight shots in the fourth quarter, the Cavaliers only outscored them 23-18 in that stanza. Lowry didn't do much of anything in the fourth quarter and didn't score, but did bounce back in OT to hit a huge 'And-1' acrobatic layup that turned out to be the final points of the game. Most of the Raptors couldn't buy a bucket in the fourth quarter and came up one point short in overtime, as a result. Game 2 is Thursday night in Toronto.

             That's where the good news ends. His fantasy line was pretty spectacular, but he basically missed three straight layups/putbacks, and at least a couple more, and shot 1-of-7 in the fourth quarter. He also fumbled a rebound late in overtime that eventually went off of teammate Serge Ibaka with the Raptors trailing by the final score, 113-112. It's tough to place all the blame on JV, as the Raptors missed 11 straight (we actually counted 12) shots in the fourth quarter, went nearly five minutes without scoring during that stretch, shot 5-of-24 in the fourth, and missed open 3-pointer after open 3-pointer. Game 2 is Thursday in Toronto.

            Serge Ibaka shot a late 3-pointer and came down on LeBron James' foot, spraining his right ankle or foot in Tuesday's thrilling Game 1 loss to the Cavaliers.
        
        
             Ibaka calmly stayed in the game and hit all three free throws he was awarded because James didn't allow him room to land, helping the Raptors hold a 105-101 lead with 1:42 left in the game. Of course, it wasn't enough in the end, but Ibaka, who had just nine points and two rebounds, was at least clutch in that instant. He really didn't play well tonight, but should be able to bounce back in Game 2. Hopefully the foot and ankle don't swell up on him overnight.

            Tristan Thompson came off the bench and hit 5-of-8 shots and 4-of-4 free throws for 14 points and 12 rebounds in Game 1 against the Raptors.
        
        
             His defense was stellar tonight and his offense wasn't bad, either. However, the fact remains that the Raptors couldn't buy a bucket in the fourth quarter, and half the time the defense of the Cavs wasn't involved in the misses. But it's clear that Cleveland will lean heavily on Thompson to help control the paint, and his free throw shooting was clutch tonight.

             While the fourth quarter and overtime were a bit insane, most of Green's damage occurred earlier in the game, when the Cavs were down. Green was pretty quiet against the Pacers in Round 1 and got some extra minutes due to overtime, but still had his best game of these playoffs tonight. Maybe that will get him going.

             LeBron James has been waiting for some help from his teammates and he got it tonight from Smith, Kyle Korver, Tristan Thompson and Jeff Green. Smith appears to be heating up, knocking down 11 3-pointers over his last three games after posting a goose egg against the Pacers in Game 3 last Wednesday. Smith kicked off the overtime period with a steal and then backed up a Korver 3-pointer with one of his own, giving the Cavs a 113-107 lead in the extra stanza. And the Cavs needed every point they got tonight, winning by just one in overtime.

             Korver's biggest shot of the night came just after the start of overtime, when he knocked a 3-pointer down off a LeBron James pick-and-roll and gave the Cavs their first lead of the night at 108-105. The Raptors were able to cut that lead to one point, but the Cavs hung on for the comeback win on the road. Kover was very quiet in his final two games against the Pacers in the previous round, but he came through in a big way tonight.

             Love's left thumb (torn ligament) is clearly bothering him and he appeared to have trouble gripping the ball at times, but his 3-pointer came in the clutch and he had several key rebounds for the Cavs. Love's shooting has been a nightmare, as he's hit just 15-of-57 shots over his last five, good for just 26 percent. But if guys like Kyle Korver, J.R. Smith, Jeff Green and Tristan Thompson are going to step up and score in double figures like they did tonight, in addition to LeBron James, it should work in the Cavs' favor.

             LeBron hit just 1-of-6 free throws and missed the game-winner at the regulation buzzer, but he also committed just one turnover on the night. The Raptors had the game in control early in the fourth quarter, but went on a five-minute scoring drought, missed their final 11 shots of the quarter, and couldn't get it done in overtime at home. This was the 21st playoff triple-double for LeBron and the Cavaliers seized home-court advantage with tonight's win at Toronto, despite being down 14 points early.

Jonas Valanciunas is coming in hot and he handled Kevin Love in the season series, so getting Tristan Thompson out there makes some sense. Regardless, Thompson is expected to play in this series.

This minor ankle issue wasn't as bad as the foot sprain he suffered in Game 1 against OKC, so there's no reason to worry about his status. Mitchell couldn't get Rudy Gobert involved as the Rockets were able to focus on him more without Ricky Rubio. Expect the rookie to be the focal point of the offense with more small-ball lineups.

            Pistons owner Tom Gores wants Stan Van Gundy to return as coach for the final year of his contract, but prefers that scenario include structural changes to the franchise's front office, according to Adrian Wojnarowski of ESPN.com.
        
        
             According to this report, Gores has suggested changes to Van Gundy's role as president of basketball operations, but SVG is resisting. Also according to Woj, some of that discussion has centered on the future role of general manager Jeff Bower, who is also in the final year of his contract. The Pistons have been a disappointment since SVG took over, especially with several misses in the draft.

            Stephen Curry (knee) is available to play Tuesday against the Pelicans.
        
        
             He has been expected to play since he was ruled out for Game 1, and he went through shootaround. Coach Steve Kerr won’t say if Curry is going to start, but it’s possible he comes off the bench, and he has come off the bench before when returning from injury. He will also likely be limited in his first game back, but now the defending champs have their two-time MVP back.

             Turner had a relatively disappointing season in 2017-18. He appeared in just 65 games and saw his playing time and his counting stats dip across the board compared to his production from 2016-17. Turner's block and steal rates also dropped. ""There’s too much focus for him a lot of times on offense,"" said McMillan. Still just 22 years of age, Turner has an enormous upside.

             Thompson logged just 24 total minutes over the first six games of the Cavs first-round series vs. Indiana, but started in Game 7 and stepped up. Thompson delivered 15 points, ten rebounds, a steal, and a block in 35 minutes. However, per Cavs reporter Dave McMenamin, Jeff Green was very effective against the Raps in the Cavs' two regular-season wins against them when they went small. We likely won't find out who is in the starting lineup until tip-off.

He had injections last week to alleviate his back spasms, and they seemed to have helped. Hill staying healthy is extremely important for Cleveland.

Boston was one of the toughest matchups for Embiid during the regular season as he shot just 38.5% from the field against them across three games, so his strong game tonight is definitely something they will look to build on. Ben Simmons' had a tougher time, finishing with 18 points, seven rebounds, six assists, two steals, one block and a game-high seven turnovers.

             Redick added a pair of triples, three boards and three assists, but as good as he was offensively, he was torched on defense by Jayson Tatum. That's a tough assignment for a player that's not exactly known for his defense, and coach Brett Brown said after the game that he'll ""go back and look at"" that matchup. We still expect Redick to have a big role, but moving a guy like Robert Covington over to Tatum makes a lot more sense.

             He started the game 0-of-5, tweaked his surgically-repaired thumb before halftime and ripped off his tape, but he looked much better in the second half and was sporting a new brace. Smart's shot selection wasn't great and he jacked up some wild 3s, but his defense was incredible yet again and his minutes should remain in the 30s if Brown continues to miss time. Jayson Tatum and Terry Rozier combined for 57 points in the win, while Al Horford played an outstanding game on both ends and finished with 26 points, seven rebounds, four assists and two triples.

            Terry Rozier scored 29 points in Monday's Game 1 win over Philly, adding eight rebounds, six assists, two steals, one block and seven 3-pointers in 35 minutes.
        
        
             Scary Terry also took a parting shot at Milwaukee's Eric Bledsoe before the game, as he showed up at the arena rocking a Drew Bledsoe jersey. Rozier knocked down 11-of-18 shots and the 76ers didn't really have an answer for him with Ben Simmons struggling to keep up with the quick PG. Rozier joins Larry Bird as just the second Celtic in the last 30 years with at least 26 points, six rebounds and six assists in consecutive playoff games and is doing an incredible job filling the void left by Kyrie Irving (knee).

             He becomes just the second rookie in the last 20 seasons with three straight playoff games of 20+ points. The 76ers foolishly tried to get away with putting J.J. Redick on him and paid the price. This may have been painful for the Philly front office to watch, as Bryan Colangelo dealt the No. 3 pick (Tatum) and a future lottery pick to move up to No. 1 and take Markelle Fultz (DNP-CD in Game 1). Tatum has a lot on his plate for the undermanned Celtics going forward and is becoming a superstar right before our eyes.

             Brown refused to reveal his availability and tried to convince the training staff to clear him, but his chances were never great with the Celtics labeling him as ""very doubtful"" before warmups started. Marcus Smart will  draw the start in Brown's place, and the Celtics will likely use a committee approach to soak up the rest of Brown's minutes. Smart will join a starting five of Terry Rozier, Jayson Tatum, Al Horford and Aron Baynes.

             Brown is trying to convince the team's trainers to let him play, but it doesn't sound like he'll get the necessary clearance. ESPN's Chris Forsberg reports that Marcus Smart will start if Brown isn't able to play, while Aron Baynes will also return to the starting lineup -- presumably sending Semi Ojeleye back to a reserve role. We'll have confirmation closer to tonight's 8pm ET tipoff.

We should have confirmation of his status after Golden State's shootaround on Tuesday.

             ""We do have to take more [three-pointers], and that's something we're going to work on,"" Thibodeau said. Minnesota ranked dead last in 3-point attempts during both the regular season and the playoffs, so this isn't exactly shocking. Karl-Anthony Towns was actually their most accurate shooter from the perimeter, at 42.1%, and Nemanja Bjelica was the only other player above 37.0%. Bjelica is a restricted free agent, while Jamal Crawford has a $4.5 million player option, and if both guys leave the Wolves will be even more desperate for shooters.

The mask is obviously frustrating him and he's thrown it aside a few times during games, saying recently that he ""will be able to make more shots and have better vision"" when he's allowed to ditch the mask.

Johnson averaged 11.7 points, 3.4 rebounds, 2.3 assists, 0.8 steals and 1.7 triples in 28.5 minutes this season, but could lose value in 2018-19 if Dion Waiters is healthy and if Dwyane Wade comes back.

             ""I want to play another year,"" Terry said. ""I can honestly stand here before you and tell you all my efforts will be to come back with this organization ... I’m not saying it will be my final season. But I want to do 20 and then re-evaluate."" Terry's veteran presence is just as important off the court for the youthful Bucks, and he's likely to earn a contract somewhere, even if it's not with Milwaukee.

             The Cavs' offense was disjointed after halftime with Indiana's pressure defense causing problems, and Hill was terrific once coach Ty Lue called his number. Despite not playing in the first half, the veteran guard finished with 11 points, six rebounds, three assists and one block, while shooting 9-of-11 at the free throw line. ""When I got out there I was just gonna play hard and give it all I got,"" Hill said. ""I wasn't worried about when [I played], just wanted to do the best I can."" He'll get one day to rest before Game 1 vs. the Raptors on Tuesday, and for now we're assuming he'll be in uniform.

            Interim coach Jay Triano ""was informed that he is not in the running"" to be the Suns next head coach, according to Arizona radio host John Gambadoro.
        
        
             Triano was initially included in Phoenix's batch of candidates, but the fact he's been ruled out of the process so early suggests that he never really had a chance at getting the full-time gig. After being asked to slog through another rough season and serve as the mouthpiece for a front office that likes to hide and an organization in dire need of direction, the Suns could've done a lot better to reward Triano than with this fate.

             Gobert had 11 points, nine boards, a steal, and zero blocks on 4-of-4 shooting in his 35.5 minutes. Simply put, Utah is going to need the big fella to be a more imposing force and a true defensive difference-maker if Utah is going to make this competitive. Gobert has spent much of the season campaigning for his Defensive Player of the Year candidacy. Now would be a good time to show the national audience why he's worthy (and he is) of the award.

             Crowder played 33 minutes, finishing with five boards and two steals on 8-of-13 from the field. That's now two strong games for Crowder in his last three, and there is an argument to be made that Crowder is going to need to play at the expense of Derrick Favors if Utah is going to make this a series. For what it's worth, Favors finished with just five points, two rebounds, two steals, and two blocks in his 25.5 minutes.

The fact that some are disappointed with this performance shows just how high Mitchell's stock has risen. The Louisville product did turn his ankle in this one, but he was walking around after the game without ice or support of any kind, so it'll just be something to watch as the Jazz prepare for Game 2.

             Tucker didn't turn the ball over a single time in his 35 minutes, and it's a very promising sign for his role in this series that Luc Mbah a Moute (20 minutes) and Ryan Anderson (nine minutes) didn't cut into his playing time.

            Bojan Bogdanovic's shot went missing at the wrong time on Sunday, finishing his season with a three-point dud and a Game 7 loss to the Cavs.
        
        
             Bogdanovic played 37 minutes, but he was just 1-of-9 from the field (including 1-of-7 from distance) with more turnovers (three) than assists (two) and was held without a single rebound. In his inaugural season with the Pacers, BB was a much better fit than almost anyone projected him to be, and there's currently no reason to think his role will be dramatically different next season. Bogdanovic will enter 2018-19 on an expiring $10.5 million contract.

            Myles Turner had just eight points, four rebounds, and no other stats before fouling out in Sunday's Game 7 loss in Cleveland.
        
        
             Turner played just 25 minutes and had only three field goal attempts, though he was a plus-10 during his time on the court. Inconsistency was a major problem for the big man this year, and improving that has to be the focal point of his offseason work. If Turner is going to be a difference-making building block for this franchise alongside Victor Oladipo, the Pacers are going to need him to take his game to another level. Looking ahead toward next year, it's very likely that you'll be able to draft Turner at a comparative discount to what he's cost prior.

             Collison had a really efficient first half before becoming invisible for the final 24 minutes, but he's not the reason the Pacers lost this game. DC will enter next season on an expiring $10M deal, but there's no reason to think Indiana will look to move on at this time. As for his fantasy stock, Collison again projects as a solid though unspectacular asset in the majority of formats.

             As he did all season long, VO stuffed the stat sheet, but it just wasn't enough to beat LeBron James on the road in a win-or-go-home playoff game. Despite the first-round loss, Oladipo blossomed into a superstar in front of our eyes this season, and there's every reason to think that he can keep it going entering the 2018-19 campaign. If you really want Dipo in your fantasy league(s) next season, you are likely going to have to spend a first-round pick to grab him.

It's unclear where Hill currently is with his health, so we'll have to wait and see if the Cavs feel comfortable enough to re-insert him into the first five ahead of Tuesday's Game 1 vs. the Raptors.

             TT had played just 24 minutes in the series altogether before Sunday's affair, so to say he was a difference-maker would be an understatement. It's clear that the Cavs are going to need to play Thompson more moving forward—especially with the size the Raptors present on their frontline—and it's fair to wonder why Thompson wasn't a bigger part of the Round 1 gameplan given his obvious impact when it mattered most. Needless to say, we wouldn't be surprised to see Thompson stick in the first five for Tuesday's Game 1 in Toronto.

             James was also 16-of-25 from the field, including 11-of-15 from the charity stripe. Any questions about LeBron's future in Cleveland will again have to wait, and now the Cavs will open the second round on Tuesday in Toronto. James was predictably terrific in this one and was brilliant throughout the first round, but Cleveland will need more than LeBron's heroics alone if they're going to continue their postseason journey to the desired destination.

We're gonna continue to not be consistent. We definitely have to have good communication this summer. Before looking elsewhere we have look at each other and be honest."" And he didn't stop there, either. ""I feel like we might not have identified the real issues...Unless we can honestly and genuinely talk and find solutions, we will have the trends that are going on right now."" To be very clear, Mahinmi is spot on in his articulate assessment and Washington is going to be facing a very interesting summer ahead.

            Stephen Curry told ESPN's Chris Haynes that the plan is for Curry to make his return on Tuesday in Game 2 vs. New Orleans.
        
        
             Curry added that the decision is ""ultimately up to the medical staff,"" but every indication is that he will play. The dynamic point guard has not been out there since March 23, but he's put in a lot of practice work and we expect that he'll quickly resume getting buckets upon returning to action.

             Howard joins David Blatt, Mike Budenholzer, Mark Jackson, James Borrego, David Fizdale, Jerry Stackhouse, Kenny Smith, Jay Larranaga and Mike Woodson as known candidates on New York's list, but it's not yet clear where the Knicks are in their quest to find the right individual. For what it's worth, Stackhouse, Fizdale, and Budenholzer are believed to have made strong impressions.

             He will be joined by Donovan Mitchell, Joe Ingles, Derrick Favors, and Rudy Gobert. Rubio could miss the entire second-round series vs. Houston, or he might be back as soon as the middle of the series. Just because O'Neale is getting the start in Game 1 doesn't necessarily mean he'll stick with the first five as the series progresses. Regardless, expect Mitchell to play a lot of point guard with Jae Crowder, Alec Burks, and potentially Dante Exum seeing an increase in playing time.

LMAM is one of their most versatile defenders and should have a nice role going forward, but his return doesn't have a lot of fantasy implications.

             We'll assume that he will start, though coach Ty Lue wouldn't confirm. ""Having an extra ballhandler is key,"" Lue said of Hill's return. The point guard has been banged up for about two weeks and was held out of the last three games. There's no word of any restrictions, so it will be interesting to see how many minutes he can handle with Cleveland's season on the line.

John Wall recently addressed the media and said he wants the Wizards to bring in an ""athletic big,"" so you would think the chances of Gortat being traded are pretty good. Gortat will be 35 next season and is coming off his worst campaign since 2010, posting averages of 8.4 points, 7.6 rebounds, 1.8 assists and 0.7 blocks.

             Normally we'd ignore reports like these, but Stein is as credible as they come. Stein said the Sixers have ""growing behind-the-scenes confidence"" that they can land LeBron, and it's no secret that his best shot of reaching the Finals would be if he remains in the East -- this gives the 76ers a possible edge over the Rockets and Lakers. It's fun to speculate, but only James knows what he's going to do this summer.

""He can come back something different next year."" His first season in Miami was a big success, as he averaged career-highs in points (11.5), rebounds (5.7), assists (2.7) and triples (1.4) with 0.5 blocks and 0.8 steals, shooting 49.7% from the field and 77% from the line in 23.4 minutes per game.

He won't be running the show as much in the next game on Tuesday with Stephen Curry expected to be back in action. Of course, Dray's defense was another big storyline in this win.

             The Pelicans going small 1-3 is going to be a problem for them despite how they've had success with Jrue Holiday on KD in previous games. Durant was also an imposing presence on defense, which continues to be an underrated part of his game. He will likely lose some shots with Stephen Curry coming back, but he's been supremely efficient next to Steph, so KD could have some huge lines coming his way.
