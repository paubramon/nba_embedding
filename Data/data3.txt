"Terry Rozier

            Terry Rozier scored 26 points against the Bucks during a 112-96 win in Game 7 on Saturday, adding six rebounds, nine assists, one steal, one block and five 3-pointers.
        
        
             The Bucks will be having nightmares of Scary Terry ending their season, especially Eric Bledsoe. Rozier's two 3-pointers on back-to-back possessions with Eric Bledsoe turning it over in between basically put the game out of reach at 82-101 with 5:19 left. Besides that, Rozier has really locked in with Al Horford with four dimes going to him, and all of Rozier's dimes led to shots in the paint or a corner 3-pointer. He's not just a backup anymore. It's going to be a treat to watch so much youth in the Boston vs. Philly series.

            Semi Ojeleye scored five points with five rebounds and one 3-pointer in 29 minutes against the Bucks in his start during Game 7 on Saturday.
        
        
             You won't find many better 5/5/0 lines than this one with Ojeleye playing outstanding defense in this win. It'll be very interesting to see if Semi starts the next game to guard Ben Simmons, which would put Al Horford on Joel Embiid. On the year, the plan has been Al on Ben with Aron Baynes on Embiid. Brad Stevens won't get much time to celebrate this win.

            Al Horford scored 26 points with eight rebounds, three assists, one steal, one block and three fouls in 33 minutes against the Bucks in Game 7 on Saturday.
        
        
             It was a sneaky 26 for Horford with no free throw makes or treys with all but four attempts coming from inside the paint. He was also having the ball go through him for a lot of the offense. Meanwhile, defense was the key for the Celtics and the made the Bucks work for every shot. After the Bucks racked up 25 fast-break points in Game 6, they didn't have any in this game. Looking ahead, Horford is going to have to guard Ben Simmons a lot, so that will be his top priority. Although, Semi Ojeleye stepping up could change that. This should be fun.

             He was in foul trouble in the first half with his third foul coming in the middle of the second quarter, but he was still able to log big minutes. This was a rough one for GA with Semi Ojeleye as an unsung hero for this series with how he defended Giannis in the last three games, especially today. Antetokounmpo's age-23 season went about as well as it could have offensively for scoring at his 26.9 points per game, but his defensive stats, assists and free throw shooting dropped off slightly. He's still going to be a top-three target next year in fantasy drafts. Additionally, the Bucks have some work to do to give him some help.

             He was ice cold until late because Marcus Smart was covering him very well, but Middleton's late shooting kept this game somewhat close while Terry Rozier was going off on the other end. Middleton's season couldn't have gone much better with 82 games and career highs basically everywhere at age 26, but his postseason play really showed he's capable of being a top-three player on a very good team. Middleton has one more year on his deal and a player option after that, but he'll likely be waiving that at just $13.0 million. For now, he's a top-25 target in most leagues in fantasy.

             While he played well, the biggest thing that will be remembered from this series is Bledsoe saying he didn't know who Terry Rozier was. Well, the answer to that question is he's a guy that destroyed him in several games during this season. On the whole for Bled, the experiment was a success for the Bucks with him having some rare durability and being elite in steals. He'll be looking at top 35-50 value for drafts next season.

             His second season was a step back from what was a somewhat promising rookie season, but at least Maker showed up in the playoffs. A couple years ago back in summer league, the Bucks were hoping that Maker could become a secondary ball-handler, but that seems like it's a ways off from happening. He won't be a fantasy target in most leagues.

After Anthony's horrendous postseason series, his free agent market will be a lot lower than most expected.

            Ricky Rubio (hamstring) will miss Game 1 against the Rockets on Sunday and could miss several weeks.
        
        
             According to ESPN, Rubio could miss 10 days, so multiple sources believe Rubio could miss this whole round. This is bad news after Rubio strained his troublesome hamstring in Game 6 on Friday. He's dealt with this injury before and the Jazz will now have to take it easy on what has been one of the easier injuries to aggravate among soft tissue injuries. Royce O'Neale really stepped up on Friday and would likely start, making him a DFS option. Donovan Mitchell's upside is higher while Alec Burks is likely to see more time.

            Stephen Curry (knee) went through shootaround, and remains questionable to play on Saturday against the Pelicans.
        
        
             Reading between the lines, it sounds like he is closer to probable than doubtful. Curry has passed every test, has hit every checkpoint in his rehab, even coach Steve Kerr hasn't been negative about a return, and today Curry said it helps that he has two days off after today. It's possible Curry does come off the bench and he could be limited, but for now the Warriors may have the best shooter ever back in their lineup to face a red-hot Pelicans team.

            Kevon Looney could be an option to start against the Pelicans.
        
        
             It makes sense. He has started against the Pelicans before and he guarded Nikola Mirotic a bunch, which would likely be the case with Draymond Green on Anthony Davis. Plus, Looney has really played some fundamentally-sound ball lately. The Warriors could certainly go small and it's possible they bring Stephen Curry off the bench when he's back.

If the Bucks beat Boston and advance to round two, he is hoping can return to game action. ""I’ll be fine soon,"" said Henson on Saturday. ""Hopefully, we can get this one tonight and next week maybe I can get out there."" Thon Maker, who started at center in Game 6, is expected to draw another start on Saturday night, with Tyler Zeller coming off the bench.

            Ricky Rubio will be re-evaluated after straining his hamstring on Friday night.
        
        
             In case you missed it, Rubio tweaked his hammy tonight and did not return. It's no surprise he will be re-evaluated after Rubio has dealt with this issue for a good portion of his post-break run. He only missed one game, but he's been unable to complete multiple games due to this issue since late March. If he's out, Alec Burks and Royce O'Neale would step up while Donovan Mitchell's rep would grow bigger.

            Donovan Mitchell looked like an MVP during a series-clinching 96-91 win over the Thunder on Friday, scoring 38 points with four rebounds, two assists, one steal and five 3-pointers in 40 minutes.
        
        
             With Ricky Rubio unable to play more than seven minutes and the Jazz only scoring 41 points at half, Mitchell came out on fire in the third quarter with Utah's first 10 points of the frame and finishing with 22 points in those 12 minutes. Based only on his start this entire postseason, Mitchell is already among the Hall of Fame elite, posting the third-most points by a rookie in his first six playoff games with his 171 (Lew Alcindor, Wilt Chamberlain). Mitchell vs. James Harden is going to be must-see TV.

            Royce O'Neale started the third quarter on Friday against the Thunder, scoring five points with two rebounds, two assists and one steal in 19 minutes.
        
        
             He's not a mainstream talent, but fantasy players and Jazz fans know that O'Neale has been a terrific add by general manager Dennis Lindsey. He's started games while Ricky Rubio (hamstring) was out and he'd be the favorite to start in Game 1 on Sunday. His perimeter defense is very good, so he fits in this matchup vs. Houston.

             This was arguably his best game of the postseason as he became a key component on offense for setting screens while his defense was very strong on the other end. Against Houston, it'll be tough for him to play big minutes with how the Rockets use the 3-point line. He'll be risky player to use in DFS for that matchup.

             Yep, Westbrook outscored his teammates 46-45 and he really had no help while Donovan Mitchell was going off. Westbrook and Mitchell both scored 20-plus points in the third quarter to become the first opposing players to each score 20 in a quarter over the last 20 postseasons. Westbrook also has scored 45-plus in three straight elimination games to become the first player ever to do so. It's clearly his team, but now OKC will have to face questions on whether other players will want to suit up with him.

             He was extremely passive in this game while Russell Westbrook tried to take over. On one play in the middle of the fourth quarter, PG-13 had Donovan Mitchell switched onto him with five fouls, but still OKC didn't get him the ball with Westbrook taking a jumper instead. This could be George's last game with the Thunder and losing in the first round certainly doesn't help OKC's case to keep him. Expect a slew of updates on George in June.

             He played 26 minutes too many. Anthony was awful and the Jazz kept going after him in pick-and-roll with Melo's man, Derrick Favors, causing the switches on high on-ball screens. Melo was basically useless all series and OKC is probably stuck with him for next season with Melo holding a $28 million player option for next season. After being the King of NY a few years ago with his legendary bodega runs, the days of Melo being a star are over.

             Not good. Rubio's hamstring problems have limited him on and off for about a month now, and he won't be going back in for what is the biggest game the Jazz have played in years. He only missed one whole game with this issue since the break, but he's had to check out multiple times. Royce O'Neale and Dante Exum will have to step up while Donovan Mitchell will be the man.

             Well, he's out of his slump for his first postseason triple-double. Oladipo was 12-for-50 from the field in his previous three games, but he was never concerned about it. ""I think I got some pretty good looks ... I just missed,"" Oladipo said about his slump before tonight. Coach Nate McMillan also said he was looking to work him in off the ball, but that wasn't needed with the best player on the Pacers hitting on all cylinders. If he plays like this on Sunday, he might send LeBron James home after one round.

The Pacers second unit doesn't have much of a scoring punch besides Lance Stephenson, so Sabonis could look to continue his three-game streak with at least 18 points on Sunday.

             He did take contact above his left eye and was bleeding, but LeBron was fine after getting a Bandaid. Milestone wise, LeBron tied Scottie Pippen for the most steals in postseason history. Obviously LeBron won't care about that after suffering his third-worst loss in his postseason career, and worst lost to an Eastern Conference opponent since 2009. He hasn't lost a first round series ever with his 12-0 record, but that could change on Sunday in Cleveland. Even if the Cavs win that, things aren't looking up in Ohio.

Love has been a shell of himself offensively with little output in post-up offense, and really just an inability to get his own shot overall.

            Fred VanVleet returned to action during a 102-92 win over the Wizards on Friday, scoring five points with four rebounds, four assists and one 3-pointer in 19 minutes.
        
        
             The stat line doesn't look like much, but the Raptors have their bench mob back. They were routinely getting beaten with the Mike Scott-led Wizards second unit doing some damage, but this time the Raptors were back to their regular-season trend of smashing when the stars were off the court -- FVV was +12 in plus-minus. VanVleet was getting a massage on his shoulder at times today, so he's not 100 percent yet.

             He's really shown up consistently and he's earning playing time in the fourth quarter now, which wasn't happening earlier in the series. Valanciunas will be a vital piece in the next round with the Cavs having some interior defensive issues, or to help defend the inside against the Pacers. He'll be a nightly DFS option.

            Bradley Beal scored 32 points during a season-ending 102-92 loss to the Raptors on Friday, adding three rebounds, one assist, two blocks and six 3-pointers in 43 minutes.
        
        
             The Wizards went into their isolation-heavy sets and that's been a problem for them, especially when both John Wall and Beal aren't both on. Looking at the big picture, Beal had himself a productive season with 82 games played in the regular season action, and he's clearly shaken off his fibula issues that bothered him for the first four seasons of his career. His recent durability uptick and being just 24 years old makes him an early-round pick next year.

             Before today, he talked about running out of gas because coach Scott Brooks was playing him for entire second halves, but this time Brooks took him out while Bradley Beal picked up a few extra minutes. Just like his entire team, Wall was a letdown on the season due to injuries and poor efficiency on the year. He's had several knee issues in his career and he'll be a risky target next year.

""I am the wrong person to go to war against,"" Oubre said earlier today. ""If I die, I am going to come back to life and kill you. It’s all good, man."" Well, Oubre will have to wait until next year to get some revenge after this loss.

Smith and maybe Jordan Clarkson should see some extra run. Korver is likely the best target, but coach Ty Lue would likely go with the hot hand late.

Delon Wright takes a hit.

Besides him, Tomas Satoransky and Ty Lawson could fill in at SG more often while Mike Scott could see a few extra minutes. Oubre is an obvious DFS play.

""So [during] those last five minutes, kind of like Game 4 here, I can have the energy to make plays for myself but also for my teammates. I think that kind of hurt us in the last game."" This quote shouldn't change his outlook much, and he should improve from Wednesday with his lowest usage rate of the series coming in that game.

He is still without a timetable, but is making solid progress. If the Jazz beat the Thunder on Friday, then Houston would host Game 1 of the semis on Sunday. If OKC wins Game 6, then the start of round two would be pushed back to next week. We'll pass along an update on Mbah a Moute after he is evaluated next week.

            Wayne Ellington said his preference would be to re-sign with the Heat this summer.
        
        
             Ellington, who will become a free agent on July 1st, averaged a career-high 11.2 points and 2.9 3-pointers this past season. He knocked down a total of 227 3-pointers off the bench, which is the most in NBA franchise history by a reserve. The Heat would like to bring him back, and they can exceed the salary cap to re-sign their own free agent. However, the issue is the luxury tax. ""Of course I want to be back,"" Ellington said. ""I also know how the luxury tax works. I do.""

             Porter has played in each of the first five games of this series, but is clearly less than 100 percent healthy. He is averaging 10.0 points, 5.0 rebounds and 1.2 steals in 31.6 minutes. We will likely get a final confirmation on his status at approximately 5:30 pm, when coach Scott Brooks addresses the pregame media. If Porter is ruled out or limited, Kelly Oubre Jr. will soak up additional minutes.

He continues to see some time at the five with the Bucks going no center for 12 minutes tonight. Antetokounmpo did look slightly tired at times in this game, which makes sense because he's logged a whopping 122 minutes in the last three games. On Saturday, the Bucks will have a tough task on their hands as they try to win one at Boston after going 0-of-3 in the previous three chances.

            Otto Porter (left lower leg contusion/soreness) is listed as questionable for Game 6 on Friday.
        
        
             This is the third Otto update today with the first saying he had a strain and the second saying he was playing through a contusion. He looked a step slow in Game 5 and at times he's been grabbing at his leg for parts of this series, so it's likely a lingering issue. Considering it's an elimination game, he'll likely be giving it a try, but he will likely be limited. If Otto is limited, Kelly Oubre will benefit most.

             JaVale McGee played well against the Spurs and Kerr said all along he wasn't going to switch McGee out for that series, but this is a different opponent and this team has some guy named Anthony Davis at center. Kerr said he wants his center to rebound, defend and just be solid, so it could be McGee again. It could also be Kevon Looney, who has really turned his career around in the last three months.

            Stephen Curry (knee) put in a full practice on Thursday and is questionable to play for Saturday against the Pelicans.
        
        
             This is big news for the Warriors after general manager Bob Myers said Curry would be very close to a return once he goes through a full practice. Curry has a big re-evaluation coming up on Friday, and he'll have to clear a bunch of medical hurdles to get the green light on Saturday. The Warriors may be getting their two-time MVP back soon.

            Otto Porter (leg) has played with a bone contusion in his left leg that has been monitored by the Wizards’ medical staff, according to Candace Buckner of the Washington Post.
        
        
             Coach Scott Brooks said he's going to hope for the best that Porter will be out there for Game 6. ""I know he’s banged up. That’s all I know as of right now,"" Brooks said. Porter has been a shell of himself lately, especially in his 31 minutes in Game 5. If he's limited, Kelly Oubre would be an easy call for DFS while Mike Scott would also benefit.

             After missing the last three games, he's likely going to be a game-time decision for the game tonight. Henson was playing well in the start of the series, but Thon Maker has been even better off the bench. If Henson can't go, Maker could be a DFS play.

He's able to guard anyone from Khris Middleton to Giannis Antetokounmpo, but won't be too involved on offense. In 31 minutes, he had just five points on three shots.

Smart had nine points, five rebounds, four assists, a steal and three blocks on 2-of-7 shooting in Game 5, but he was better than the line suggested and made some huge defensive plays.

             He's been dealing with this right lower leg strain since the end of the regular season and hasn't looked healthy during the playoffs -- he's averaging just 10.0 points, 5.0 rebounds, 1.6 assists, 1.0 blocks, 1.2 steals and 1.0 triples on 48.8% shooting. Coach Scott Brooks made it sound like there's a chance Porter wouldn't play, but we'd expect him to tough it out with Washington's season on the line. For what it's worth, he's not listed on the injury report.

Plumlee was a key part of Denver's second unit, but he was never a consistent fantasy option and finished with averages of 7.1 points, 5.4 rebounds, 1.9 assists and 1.1 blocks in 19.5 minutes.

The Grizzlies had an embarrassing finish to the season, losing 29 of their final 33 games. Now that they tanked their way to a top-5 pick, the Grizzlies will try to bounce back next season with Mike Conley and Marc Gasol leading the charge.

             Whiteside played just 15.4 minutes per game in Round 1 vs. Philly and voiced his frustration about his lack of playing time several times. He missed 28 games during the regular season due to injuries and his numbers were down across the board after a career year in 2016-17. Whiteside is on the books for another two seasons ($25.4M in 2018-19 and a $27M player option in 2019-20), so moving him is going to be difficult.

However, his shooting left a lot to be desired, as he ranked in the 26th percentile or lower in accuracy from the short midrange, long midrange and 3-point line. Taylor is under contract for a mere $1.5 million next season and has a decent chance of opening the campaign as Dennis Schroder's backup.

            The Rockets advanced to the second round with a 122-104 win on Wednesday, led by James Harden's 24 points, 12 assists, five rebounds, four 3-pointers, two steals and two blocks.
        
        
             When coach Mike D'Antoni was asked about the Wolves' various defensive schemes to slow down Harden, he replied, ""I don't think there is a solution."" Harden can torch defenders from deep when they dive under screens, he can drive past them when they go over, and his vision and passing add another element of danger no matter the coverage. ""If you're going to play with certain teams, you have to keep scoring with them,"" D'Antoni said, self-referentially. ""If you can't, you're in trouble."" The Rockets' next opponent (either Utah or OKC) can't say he didn't warn them.

            Clint Capela sank 12-of-14 shots during Houston's series-clinching win on Wednesday, scoring 26 points with 15 rebounds, one steal and one block in 33 minutes.
        
        
             The Rockets dropped 50 points in the third quarter during Game 4, and they created separation after halftime again tonight with a 30-15 edge in the third quarter. They've yet to lose a game all season when Capela scores 20+ points and his presence around the rim is an ideal counterpoint to all of Houston's 3-point shooting. He didn't commit a single turnover tonight and was probably on a lot of winning DFS teams with 48.5 fantasy points.

             Tucker was sore on Tuesday but never considered sitting out, saying, ""When I hurt it, I heard a crack and crumble. I was scared about what it was, but it's just a contusion. Like I told [coach Mike D'Antoni], it would take more than that to keep me out."" The Rockets get some extra rest with their second-round opponent yet to be decided, so Tucker should be fine going forward.

             Anderson's role has been limited by design in this series -- he's coming back from an ankle injury, but coach Mike D'Antoni was also just playing the matchups. ""Numbers point out probably [Anderson] is more effective when he's matched up with Clint [Capela] instead of at the five,"" D'Antoni said. ""Right now, Nene is playing pretty well and we like the matchup with Nene on KAT."" Anderson's role will be dictated by Houston's second-round opponent, either Utah or Oklahoma City, but either way he's unlikely to be worth DFS owners' attention.

             KAT failed to score double-digit points in Games 1 & 2, but he began to decode the Rockets' swarming, switching defense with three straight double-doubles. He stayed aggressive when the Rockets went small without Clint Capela tonight, forcing coach Mike D'Antoni to re-insert Capela, which is exactly the type of gameplan-altering impact KAT needed to have in this series -- unfortunately, it's a case of 'too little, too late' for the Wolves' franchise centerpiece.

             Teague dislocated his pinkie finger during Game 4 but returned after having it re-set, and there was never any doubt about his status tonight. He quietly put up top-60 value in his first season with the Wolves and should stick in that range next season -- Teague will earn a guaranteed $19.0 million and the Wolves' core is almost entirely under contract for 2018-19, so we're not expecting drastic shifts in fantasy value.

             Butler returned from right knee surgery on Apr. 6 and had just three regular-season games to prepare for the playoffs. He finished the Wolves' 4-1 series loss with averages of 15.8 points, 1.6 triples, 6.0 rebounds, 4.0 assists, 0.8 steals and a mere 1.0 turnovers in 34.0 minutes. We'll assume the soreness is within the normal bounds for a player returning from surgery, but will keep an eye on him as Minnesota conducts exit interviews.

             George made 12-of-26 field goals and 8-of-10 free throws in 45 minutes, and his ability to manufacture offense was critical to the Thunder comeback. OKC has assisted only 44.2% of their made field goal attempts, easily the lowest rate among playoff teams -- for perspective, the 76ers lead everyone with a 67.9% assist rate, and five teams are above 60.0%. That rate actually fell for OKC tonight, at just 33.3%, but it paid off thanks to the individual brilliance of PG-13 and Russell Westbrook. George has the 13th-highest usage in the postseason and that's not going to change in a must-win situation on Friday.

             Westbrook scored 20 points in the third quarter, as the Thunder used a 22-3 burst to erase a 25-point deficit in just eight minutes of action. It hasn't always been a pretty series for Westbrook, with Utah's defense limiting him to 29-of-79 shooting (36.7%) through four games, but he was unstoppable after halftime tonight. He buried 3-pointers and a sequence of mid-range jumpers, rather than challenging Rudy Gobert on penetration, and we'll be closely watching that dynamic in Utah on Friday. Either way, we're expecting some fireworks.

             Melo has a $27.0 million player option for 2018-19 and the Thunder may be hoping he opts for unrestricted free agency  -- his regular-season stats were the worst since his rookie season in Denver. It will be interesting to see if he can reclaim 32+ minutes in another must-win game at Utah on Friday -- Melo was on the bench for most of OKC's game-changing run in the third quarter, and his absence was conspicuous in light of his struggles in Games 1-4. Meanwhile, Jerami Grant was +13 in 23 minutes tonight and continues to make a case for more playing time.

             Jazz coach Quin Snyder gambled by playing Gobert with four fouls in the third quarter, and he promptly picked up his fifth. His absence was immediately obvious with OKC erasing a 25-point deficit in just eight minutes of action, after which the Jazz couldn't regain the advantage. Gobert hadn't played fewer than 33 minutes in the series prior to tonight, and he's not prone to foul trouble, so this shouldn't alter his outlook as a prime DFS target at center.

             Crowder scored 15 points in the first quarter and went on to tie his career high (regular season or playoffs) with six triples, but it wasn't enough to stave off a furious comeback from Russell Westbrook and the Thunder. As good as Crowder was tonight, his efforts threw the rest of Utah's bench into stark relief. Ekpe Udoh had two points and nobody else got into the scoring column, with Royce O'Neale as the only other bench player to log more than five minutes.

             Before the game, Kevin Love said the Cavs have been focused on ""not getting stagnant on offense ... have that weak-side action and continue to get open looks."" Smith did get open looks but he continued to clank them, going 0-of-8 from downtown, and he's now averaging 6.3 points on 9-of-36 shooting (25.0 percent) since a solid Game 1. Kyle Korver scored 19 points with five triples tonight, and has been LeBron's only reliable running mate on offense the past few games.

             LeBron blocked Victor Oladipo's layup attempt with 3.0 seconds remaining to preserve the tie, then sent the home crowd into a frenzy with a buzzer-beating 3-pointer from the top of the key. He rounded out his line with one steal, one block and one 3-pointer, netting a tidy 69.0 fantasy points tonight. If you're monitoring LeBron's accumulation of gaudy stats, he is just one steal behind Scottie Pippen for the most in NBA history (395), he set a new personal best (regular season or playoffs) by making 15 free throws without a miss, and he tied his personal best with 18 first-half points in the restricted area. Oh, he's also had 76 postseason games with 30+ points, 5+ rebounds and 5+ assists, which is 25 games more than the next-closest player (Michael Jordan). We are all witnesses.

             Love was limited to five points in Game 4 and his struggles have been pronounced over the past week, leaving LeBron James to shoulder an even heavier burden than usual offensively. He jammed his thumb during Game 2 but has dismissed the injury as an excuse, saying, ""Initially it was painful and in the few days that followed, but now [the pain] has kind of subsided and I’m just getting my feel back in my left thumb."" He didn't have any defensive stats tonight, with just one assist, so if he's not scoring he's not helping your DFS teams.

             Budenholzer has withdrawn from the Suns coaching search but he's still a candidate for the Knicks' vacant job. Among the league's assistant coaches Atlanta might consider to replace him, Woj mentions Stephen Silas (Hornets), Nate Tibbetts (Blazers), David Vanterpool (Blazers), Ime Udoka (Spurs) and James Borrego (Spurs).

             Sabonis played an expanded role on Sunday due to Myles Turner's foul trouble, and that 19-point game seems to have bolstered his role and confidence. Turner was in foul trouble again tonight and Sabonis wound up tying the game with an elbow jumper down the stretch, but Indy couldn't complete the comeback and now trails 3-2 in the series. Given his excellent play the past two games, it makes sense to target Sabonis in DFS unless his price spikes in the next 48 hours.

             Once again, Turner was extremely efficient (3-of-4 FGs, 2-of-2 FTs) but just couldn't stay on the court. It's even more disappointing since the Cavs' small-ball lineups leave plenty of room for the Pacers' 7-footer to operate in the paint. Domantas Sabonis has thrived with Turner limited the past two games, which adds another layer of uncertainty as the series shifts back to Indy for Game 6.

             The Pacers and Cavs series has the slowest pace in the postseason, and the Cavs' defense has throttled Oladipo lately -- since Game 3 he's a combined 12-of-50 from the field (24.0 percent). Poor shot selection has plagued him and it'll be interesting to see what coach Nate McMillan draws up to get his star guard going in a critical Game 6 at home on Friday. If you're looking for a silver lining, the boards tied Oladipo's season high and the turnovers were his fewest of the postseason.

             The rookie tweaked his ankle just before halftime on Sunday and there was added concern because he missed extended time with a right ankle injury in March.

Fred VanVleet (shoulder) was out again and his optimism hasn't translated to minutes in the first round, with coach Dwane Casey citing concerns from the Raptors' training staff. The Raptors badly miss VanVleet's leadership with the second unit, but Wright has done his best to pick up the slack and he's routinely hitting value in playoff DFS leagues.

            Bradley Beal needed 20 field goals attempts to score 20 points on Wednesday, making eight shots with three 3-pointers, four rebounds, three assists, one steal and three turnovers in 36 minutes.
        
        
             Beal's aggression faded after he picked up an offensive foul less than a minute into the game, and he might have been extra cautious since he fouled out of Game 4. The Wizards' offense had been humming to the tune of 111.1 points per 100 possessions, which was second only to the Pelicans and Warriors in the postseason, but they hurt themselves tonight from downtown (5-of-26) while giving up 14 points off turnovers. Washington badly needs a bounce-back effort from Beal on Friday.

             Gortat logged 34 minutes tonight despite hitting that mark just seven times during the regular season. He snatched five boards on the offensive glass and helped the Wizards enjoy a 50-35 edge in rebounding, but it still wasn't enough. The home team has won the first five games in this tit-for-tat series, a trend the Wizards hope continues on Friday -- the victor of Game 5 goes on to win a seven-game series 83 percent of the time, so the odds aren't in their favor.

             Wall did commit seven turnovers, but he shot 10-of-21 from the field and 6-of-7 from the line, and simply didn't get much help from his teammates. He said before the game that he's trying to ""be aggressive"" offensively, while also ""trying to keep [Bradley Beal] going and play my game. That gets my teammates involved."" Everyone else shot 27-of-69 tonight (39.1%), and Washington now needs to defend their home court on Friday to force a Game 7.

            The earliest possible change to the one-and-done rule would be the 2020 draft, according to Adrian Wojnarowski of ESPN.
        
        
             Woj reports that that the NBA and NBPA are still having ongoing conversations about the rule change, which would allow high school seniors to enter the league. We should have plenty of updates on this situation in the months ahead.

             Over the past couple of weeks, Wade has hinted that he may hang up his sneakers. However, speaking with reporters after Miami was eliminated in Philadelphia on Tuesday night, he wasn't ready to make a final decision. ""That's not my focus,"" Wade said. ""Fresh off this NBA season, my 15th year, I sit back and think about that. Then I dive and throw myself into my family. They're next on my bucket list, making sure I'm there for them. And when it comes to the basketball side of it, which is a long time away from now, then I'll think about that.""

             Leonard has been very quiet throughout this year-long ordeal. It will be fascinating to see what he has to say regarding the past few months and his future with the Spurs. If Kawhi is not willing to sign an extension this summer to stay in San Antonio longterm, then the Spurs will be forced to shop him. It would be a devastating blow to the franchise if he left as an unrestricted free agent in 2019.

             For the series, Whiteside averaged just 5.2 points, 6.0 rebounds and 1.2 blocks in 15.4 minutes. His biggest beef was that he felt he wasn't given a proper opportunity. ""At least give me a chance to fight. At least give me a chance to fight,"" said Whiteside. ""I can understand if I was playing 30 minutes and I played bad. At least give me a chance."" It will be very interesting to see what happens in South Beach this offseason. The Heat would like to move him, but his contract makes that difficult.

             Speaking with reporters after the Spurs were eliminated on Tuesday night, Gasol made it clear he believes he has plenty left in the tank. He will turn 38 in July but still has two years and $32 million left on his current contract. The Spurs limited him to just 23.5 minutes per game this season and he averaged 10.1 points, 8.0 rebounds and 3.1 assists per game.

             His errant pass trickled out of bounds without being touched by a Warrior and Kevin Durant answered with a money jumper and then two free throws to seal the win for the Warriors. Ginobili looks like he's thinking retirement, while Pau Gasol, who is not thinking about shutting it down, as far as we know, might want to rethink that decision after his one-point, six-board performance in just 18 minutes, missing all three of his shots. Whatever Ginobili decides, he's had a fantastic NBA career thus far.

             Durant hit a pair of free throws and a clutch jumper to halt a LaMarcus Aldridge late run that saw the Spurs cut GSW's lead to just two points with 57 seconds left in the game, and scored 10 of 12 GSW points in a late fourth quarter run that iced the game. Green's 19 rebounds were a career playoff high and Durant hit 35-of-37 free throws in the series and was 8-of-8 tonight. The Warriors will get Anthony Davis, Jrue Holiday and the Pelicans in Round 2, which should be a blast to watch.

             Olynyk was clearly the center of choice for Erik Spoelstra in these playoffs, as he had little interest in using Hassan Whiteside against the Sixers. Olynyk played just nine minutes in Game 4 and wasn't great in Games 2 and 3, but came up big in Game 1 and Game 5, ending his season on a high note. It remains to be seen how the Heat will deal with the rift between Whiteside and Spoelstra in the offseason, so it's possible that Olynyk could be a starter next season.

             Whiteside had a 13 & 13 double-double in Game 4, giving us some hope that he might be able to help in Game 5, but it wasn't meant to be. In the other four games of this series, Whiteside's best scoring night was just five points, his best rebounding night was five, and his best shot blocking night was two of them in Game 1. To his credit, he remained calm and didn't say anything outrageous when asked what the future holds for him after the game, but it's a real shame that Whiteside fell so hard and so fast once the regular season ended.

            Josh Richardson started in Tuesday's Game 5 despite his shoulder injury, but got into early foul trouble and finished with one block, three fouls and nothing else in just seven minutes tonight.
        
        
             Richardson wasn't a lock to play, but was cleared after pre-game warmups. He didn't last long after picking up two quick fouls and then picking up his third right after he checked back in after an extended rest. Philadelphia also took control of the game in the third quarter, so it looks like Erik Spoelstra chose to leave him on the bench. It was a sour end to a great season for Richardson, who is now trade eligible for the first time since signing his extension in the offseason.

             Simmons was not incredible or spectacular tonight, but he was rock solid and helped lead the Sixers to the semifinals in the East for the first time since 2012. The Sixers will get the winner of the Bucks-Celtics series next and Simmons finished with averages of 18.2 points, 10.6 rebounds, 9.0 assists and 2.4 steals against the Heat in their five-game series. Despite being so young, the Sixers are now only behind the Raptors according to Vegas odds on winning the East, and just in front of the Cavaliers.

             With guys like Ben Simmons, Joel Embiid, Dario Saric, Robert Covington, Ersan Ilyasova and Marco Belinelli doing the dirty work, the Sixers are quite content to let Redick bomb away from downtown and stay out of the way. His 27 points led the team tonight and he scored at least 24 points in three of the five games in this series. Redick and the Sixers will get the winner of the Bucks-Celtics series next.

             This is the Sixers' first trip to the second round since 2012 and Embiid's strong play is a big reason why the Sixers might not only win the East, but might even have a chance to win the entire shebang this year. Embiid has been back for three games since his orbital injury and is averaging 18.7 points, 10.3 boards, 3.0 blocks, 1.3 steals and 1.0 3-pointers since returning. The Sixers will get the winner of the Celtics-Bucks series in the semis and the Celtics currently hold a 3-2 advantage in that one.

             Giannis didn't score a lot tonight, but he also wasn't involved all that much, taking just 10 shots in 41 minutes. And while the Celtics defense deserves some credit on that end, it's unacceptable that the Bucks didn't feed him more tonight. Look for that game plan to change on Thursday in Milwaukee, when the Bucks will try to stop the Celtics and force a Game 7, which would take place in Boston.

            Marcus Smart played through his thumb injury on Tuesday night and made one of the plays of the night, passing the ball while laying on his back to Al Horford for a late layup in a 92-87 Game 5 win.
        
        
             This was Smart's first game since March 11 and he finished with nine points, five rebounds, four assists, a steal and three blocks on 2-of-7 shooting. Some rust was clearly to be expected, but Smart played a solid game and the pass to Horford might have ended up stopping a Bucks comeback. We're guessing Smart should be ready to roll again on Thursday night in Milwaukee for Game 6.

             Rozier and Eric Bledsoe had a nice battle all night and managed to avoid punching each other in the face. Their numbers were incredibly similar, but we'll give Rozier the edge since his team won the game. He outshined both Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown tonight, which isn't easy to do. The return of Marcus Smart hasn't hurt Rozier too much.

             Horford got a shot up after the 24-second clock expired that would have given the Bucks the ball back, but the officials missed it, making for one of the more interesting moments of the game. Horford wasn't exactly dominant tonight, but this was easily his best game since he had 24 points, 12 boards, two steals, three blocks and a 3-pointer in Game 1 of the series. Game 6 is in Milwaukee on Thursday night.

After posting averages of 11.8 points, 3.3 dimes, 1.7 triples, 0.9 steals and 1.6 turnovers per game on 44.6% shooting during his rookie season, he'll be someone to think about snatching up towards the later rounds on draft day next year.

             Teague hurt his finger during Monday's Game 4 loss, but he was available to return, and there was never much doubt about his availability for tomorrow's game. We'll have official confirmation on his status closer to Wednesday's tip.

             Jones sat out Monday's Game 4 loss, and it was Derrick Rose who was the primary beneficiary, logging 32 minutes off the bench. If he's again forced to the sidelines on Wednesday, it'll be Rose, Jeff Teague and Jamal Crawford divvying up his minutes.

            The NBA is reportedly reviewing Russell Westbrook's Game 4 incident, and deliberating whether or not a suspension is warrented for Game 5.
        
        
             Westbrook was waiting to check in the game at the scorer's table during the fourth quarter of the Game 4 loss, but got himself involved in an altercation between Raymond Felton and Rudy Gobert after a foul, stepping onto the court and slapping away Gobert's hand. Overall, this was a very minor incident, and while Westbrook did technically leave the bench area, it would be absolutely shocking to see commissioner Adam Silver dish out a suspension for a crucial Game 5 in OKC. Stay tuned.

             Brad Stevens said that Smart ""felt great"" after shootaround, and while he may have his minutes monitored in his first game back following a six-week absence, he should give the Celtics a major boost on defense. Khris Middleton has been killing them, scoring 25.5 points per game on 61.5% shooting, so perhaps Smart can help bring down Middleton's shooting percentages to a less-ridiculous range. Shane Larkin's minutes will take a fairly large hit with Smart back in action.

In addition, it was reported after the game that J-Rich planned to play in Game 5. If Richardson is ruled out, it would be a major blow to Miami's chances. We likely won't have confirmation on his status until Coach Spoelstra speaks with reporters at approximately 6:30 pm.

             Cousins was inline for a $200-plus million payday this summer, before rupturing his Achilles. The Pels would lose him for nothing if they let him walk. However, they have been playing incredibly well with him sidelined, and there are only a handful of teams that have the cap space to offer a max contract. Thus, New Orleans has all the leverage. It will be one of the more interesting free agent situations this offseason.

However, considering Smart's tenacity and eagerness to return, it would be somewhat surprising if he was cleared to play but decided to sit out. Starting point guard Terry Rozier told reporters: ""I think he’s playing. But you didn’t hear it from me."" If Smart does return, Shane Larkin will likely be bumped from the rotation.

            P.J. Tucker (knee) said that he will ""definitely be ready"" for Game 5 Wednesday vs. Minnesota.
        
        
             Tucker appeared to tweak his left knee in the second quarter of Game 4 on Monday. He limped to the locker room but returned to the game shortly thereafter. ""I'm okay, a little sore, not great,"" said Tucker after the contest. ""I'll definitely be ready for [Game 5], no question."" The Rockets can't afford to lose Tucker, especially with Luc Mbah a Moute (shoulder) also sidelined.

            Russell Westbrook hit just 7-of-18 shots and missed all three of his 3-pointers for 23 points, 14 rebounds, three assists and five turnovers in Monday's 113-96 Game 4 loss to the Jazz, putting the Thunder in a 3-1 hole in the series.
        
        
             Westbrook was basically looking for a fight the entire game and got into serious foul trouble early, picking up his fourth foul before halftime. He managed to make it through the entire game without being ejected or fouling out, but he was trying to pick a fight with anyone in a Jazz uniform who crossed his path. Westbrook was all about close-guarding Ricky Rubio in the first half, but it really only messed up the Thunder's defensive rotations and got Westy into foul trouble. The Thunder should be able to regroup and put up a better fight in Game 5 in OKC, but the Jazz are clearly in control of this series with their defensive presence, along with their physicality.

             George beefed with Joe Ingles all night and turned the ball over six times. The Thunder won the first quarter 30-24, but were dominated for the rest of the game, and unless Carmelo Anthony steps up to help George and Russell Westbrook, or they figure out how to defend the Jazz as well as they're being defended, the Thunder are going fishing soon. Game 5 is in OKC on Wednesday.

            Jae Crowder inadvertently forearmed Steven Adams in the face on Monday night and was ejected, finishing with six points, seven boards, three steals and a 3-pointers on 2-of-10 shooting in 28 minutes.
        
        
             He didn't play that well, but still put up some fantasy numbers before leaving. Crowder was beefing with Russell Westbrook (surprise) and was swatting away the arm of Carmelo Anthony when he accidentally popped Adams in the nose. There's no chance of a suspension here, as Russell Westbrook, Paul George, Raymond Felton, Joe Ingles, Ricky Rubio and Rudy Gobert were all hit, or hit someone, harder than Adams got it tonight. But the difference was Crowder caught Adams on the nose.

             Gobert took a shot to the batteries from Raymond Felton, and despite selling the drama, he's fine. It felt like he had more than one block tonight, but whether he's blocking shots or not, he's playing tough defense for the best defensive team in the league. OKC scored 30 points in the first quarter and then the Jazz put the clamps down and dominated the final three quarters. Game 5 is Wednesday at OKC.

             He hit five 3-pointers in Game 3 and the Thunder have apparently ignored the memo that says he's one of the best 3-point shooters in the NBA, as they keep leaving him open. This series is quite heated and Ingles has been in the middle of several flare ups, mostly with Paul George. He's also on fire, averaging 20.5 points, 3.0 rebounds, 4.0 assists, 1.0 steals and 5.0 3-pointers over his last two games. He'll look to keep it going in OKC on Wednesday night for Game 5, where a Utah win would end the series.

             Mitchell broke Karl Malone's team playoff scoring record for a rookie with his 33 points tonight, as Malone scored 31 points in a game back in 1986. These two teams hate each other and there were six technical fouls handed out tonight, but Mitchell managed to stay out of most of the drama. He doesn't look like a rookie, and really hasn't all year, and the Jazz will look to put away the Thunder in Oklahoma City in Game 5 on Wednesday. However, a more likely scenario would be the Jazz ending the series in Game 6 back at home. Mitchell is a much needed offensive force on a team that thrives by playing defense, and this series has been the most entertaining matchup of the playoffs thus far.

             The Rockets scored 50 points (and hit nine 3-pointers) in the third quarter, which was the second most points in a quarter of a playoff game of all time, as the 1962 Lakers scored 51 points in a quarter. The Wolves only scored 20 in that one, turning a one-point deficit for Minnesota into a 31-point lead for the Rockets, who never looked back. Harden didn't really look like himself in Games 2 and 3, but was back to his old tricks tonight. The Rockets will look to end this series at home on Wednesday.

             This was probably Paul's best game in the playoffs thus far, and the five steals makes that more of a fact than a statement. The Rockets went crazy and scored 50 points in the third quarter and never looked back. Game 5 is in Houston on Wednesday, when the Rockets will look to end the series.

             He was better than Karl-Anthony Towns tonight, although Towns finally played well and had his best game of the series.

             Jeff Teague was dealing with a jammed finger, but was able to return, and the Rockets put the game away with a 50-point third quarter, so Rose got some extra run tonight. He's actually been playing well for the Wolves, scoring 16 points or more in three of his four playoff games, but it would appear that the Wolves' season is winding down quickly now that they're down 3-1 in the series. If you want to play Rose as a punt play on Wednesday, it makes sense.

             He suffered a jammed finger during the game and while he was able to return, he wasn't really needed after the Rockets outscored the Rockets 50-20 in the third quarter. Teague might be a little iffy for Wednesday's Game 5, but our guess is he'll be in the starting lineup. Just be prepared to make sure he's good to go if you plan on using him. Teague was a massive fantasy disappointment tonight after going for 23 points, eight assists and three 3-pointers in Game 3.

             KAT hasn't been spectacular in this series, but at least came through with some points and boards tonight. He didn't have a steal, block or a 3-pointer tonight and the Wolves got blown out by a score of 50-20 in the third quarter, but this was a much better showing for Towns than Games 1 and 2, when he scored a grand total of 13 points. It appeared the Wolves had a chance to even the series up at 2-2, but all of those hopes and dreams died in the third quarter.

            According to Jon Krawczynski of The Athletic, Tyus Jones (knee) is unavailable for Game 4 on Monday.
        
        
             This was reported halfway through the second quarter, but coach Tom Thibodeau isn't exactly known for his transparency with injuries. Jones had some swelling in his knee and tried to warm up, but it was too stiff. We'll consider him day-to-day for now, but this locks in Derrick Rose as Jeff Teague's backup.

Either way, he's on the cusp of a return, and once he does get back out there, Shane Larkin could drop from the rotation entirely.

Lillard still believes that the Blazers can turn things around and become a contender just like the Warriors did after their first round loss to the Clippers in 2014. ""I honestly feel like our team is capable of something like that,"" Lillard said.

             Jusuf Nurkic will be a restricted free agent and Davis will be unrestricted, but the Blazers already have $110.5 million in guaranteed salary on the books and likely can't afford to keep both. Davis gave the Portland second unit a huge lift this season, posting averages of 5.3 points, 7.4 boards and 0.7 blocks in 18.9 minutes. If Davis does return and Nurkic doesn't, we'd rather take a flier on Zach Collins.

He wants to live in New York.’’ Budenholzer was in advanced talks  with the Suns before turning them down for unknown reasons, so we'll see if the Knicks can close the deal. Coach Bud has two years and $13 million remaining on his deal with the Hawks, so the Knicks may have to offer some compensation to pry him away.

             ""I want to be here,"" he said. ""It's no secret."" Nurkic will be a restricted free agent this summer, but the Blazers already have $110.5 million in guaranteed money on the books. The Blazers have some intriguing young talent behind Nurk in Zach Collins and Caleb Swanigan, so it wouldn't be a surprise if they let him walk if his price gets out of hand. After a monster finish to the 2016-17 season, Nurkic didn't live up to expectations in 2017-18.

             Turner was hot from the field and drained 3-of-4 triples, and it's a shame he couldn't stay on the court longer. Backup big man Domantas Sabonis was terrific, but the Pacers still lost 104-100 to even the series at two games each. Turner's foul trouble is the latest culprit in a series that's defied easy fantasy value, with Victor Oladipo the only Pacers player inside the top-50 for DFS production this postseason. He's followed by Bojan Bogdanovic (No. 52), Thaddeus Young (No. 55), Turner (No. 63) and Darren Collison (No. 65). Tread carefully.

             Bogdanovic dropped 30 points in Game 3 and the Cavaliers obviously focused on that tonight, with their defense aggressively closing out on Bojan whenever he touched the ball. He's also being tasked with the primary defensive assignment vs. LeBron James, so we'll forgive him for an off-night shooting the ball. He'll look to regain the touch in Cleveland on Wednesday.

             Sabonis was thrust into a bigger role with Myles Turner in foul trouble, and he rose to the occasion with strong play at both ends in 25 minutes of action. Victor Oladipo is cruising toward Most Improved Player honors, but let's not forget the leap made by the other guy Indiana acquired in the Paul George trade -- Sabonis improved in every facet of the game this season and gives Indy a safety net on nights like this when Myles Turner is limited.

             The Cavs didn't give Oladipo much breathing room offensively, and even when he did get clean looks they just weren't falling. One of his few makes was a lucky bank-shot on a 3-pointer, but on the plus side he sank 4-of-5 free throws with a relatively modest three turnovers -- he came in averaging 5.0 per game in the first round. Indiana ceded homecourt advantage with the loss, but fans of entertaining NBA games aren't complaining.

             It was Thompson's first action since Game 1 and coach Ty Lue said before the game that he wanted TT to provide ""toughness, rebounding [and] defense."" He checked in early with Kevin Love in foul trouble but the change didn't last long, as Lue soon reverted to his usual rotation with Larry Nance, Jeff Green, Jordan Clarkson and Rodney Hood comprising the bench in the second half. Barring a dramatic change in fortunes, Thompson won't be a DFS option this postseason.

             Love is playing with a partially torn ligament in his left thumb. It hasn't cost him any time but he's struggled to make a consistent impact in the series. After attempting zero shots in the third quarter of Game 3, Love vowed to ""find different ways to try and get the ball ... I need to go get it and just need to be more ... vocal in calling for it."" His overall attempts dipped tonight but that was mostly due to the foul trouble, and the Cavs will continue to brainstorm ways to keep him engaged offensively.

             Clarkson averaged 3.3 points through the first three games of the series, but he was on fire with 5-of-5 shooting in the first half tonight. He failed to score after that initial outburst, however, which typifies his unreliability against a strong defense in the postseason.

            John Wall powered the Wizards to a series-tying Game 4 victory on Sunday, scoring 27 points with 14 assists, six rebounds and three steals in 44 minutes.
        
        
             Tonight's line adds up to 60.2 fantasy points for Wall, according to the NBA's official scoring, which is just above his average of 58.9 per game in the postseason. That's third-best behind only LeBron James and Anthony Davis. He made 10-of-24 field goals and 7-of-10 free throws, and came up huge after Bradley Beal fouled out late in the fourth quarter of a tied game. It's safe to say Wall's surgically-repaired left knee isn't holding him back.

             Gortat grabbed his lower back after absorbing some contact in the second quarter, but it didn't slow him down as the game progressed. He earned key fourth-quarter minutes and even threw down a vicious hammer dunk through multiple defenders to tie the game with 5:35 remaining (watch via the link below). If you ignore a disastrous Game 2 in Toronto, Gortat is averaging a solid 13.3 points on 20-of-27 shooting (74.1%) in the series.

             Satoransky had a breakout season in 2017-18, including averages of 10.4 points, 5.8 assists, 4.4 rebounds and 1.0 steals in 30 starts. He even played 16.8 minutes as a reserve, but has seen his role usurped by newcomer Ty Lawson over the past three games. Lawson also finished this game scoreless in 15 minutes, and neither guy can be trusted in DFS while the Wizards' starting backcourt is healthy.

             It's the first time all season that Beal has fouled out of a game. The sixth foul was questionable and Beal was fuming afterward, but he managed to avoid a technical or the risk of further punishment from the league. He was cruising offensively with 10-of-19 field goals and 6-of-7 free throws, and the Wizards didn't hang their heads when he left -- instead, they looked fired up as they closed the game on a 14-6 run. Beal said he wants 20 shot attempts per game and we expect him to come out firing in Toronto on Wednesday.

             Both teams stayed big down the stretch in this game, and coach Dwane Casey opted for Poeltl's defensive presence over Jonas Valanciunas. The second-year center fouled out on a costly play with 1:33 remaining but was otherwise impressive, and may have earned himself more minutes as the series shifts back to Toronto.

Even after Poeltl fouled out late in the game, Pascal Siakam checked in with Serge Ibaka shifting to center. Random duds are always a risk for Valanciunas, who only needs 20+ minutes to hit DFS value most games.

             Marcin Gortat crashed into Anunoby just before halftime, forcing the rookie to limp into the locker room with trainers. He missed seven games in March due to a sprained right ankle, so it was encouraging to see him start the second half after getting re-taped. As a precaution, we'll list him as 'questionable' for Game 5 in Toronto on Wednesday.

             DeRozan only got to the free-throw line twice Game 3, yet he had 12 attempts by the end of the first quarter today. His ability to generate fouls usually pads his scoring numbers even when his shot is off, which is one reason he's such a stable DFS option. The home team has held serve in all four games of this series, a trend Toronto hopes to continue at Air Canada Centre on Wednesday.

             Draymond Green locked into Aldridge defensively today, but LA managed to bank an enormous buzzer-beater on a turnaround 3-pointer to preserve the Spurs' lead in the fourth quarter (link below). He finished 7-of-19 from the field but was 3-of-3 from deep and 5-of-5 at the FT line, and committed just one turnover in 38 minutes. The Spurs pulled out a double-digit victory despite getting out-rebounded 61-34 in this game, but they'll need to fix the issue to stay alive as the series shifts back to Golden State.

             The veteran went down briefly after banging his knee late in the fourth quarter, but he continued to play and there's no way he's missing Game 5.

""[Teams] are still waiting me out on the pick-and-roll and trying to get me out away from the play,"" Green said recently. ""I know I can take the game over defensively on any given night."" He's helped limit San Antonio to 25.5 points in the paint and 6.3 fastbreak points in this series, and despite today's loss the Warriors can advance with a win at home on Tuesday.

             Thompson didn't make a single shot within 15 feet and finished with a team-worst net rating of -24.4, and credit is due to Danny Green's defense tonight. The Warriors' pace was down tonight, though, and it shouldn't take long for Thompson to regain his elite shooting stroke -- after all, he was a combined 31-of-49 from the field (63.3%) in the first three games of the series.

Even so, Livingston isn't a desirable DFS target.

For now, we'll consider him doubtful for Wednesday's Game 5 in Toronto.

             Brown essentially single-handedly kept the Celtics in the game, helping Boston go on a huge second-half surge to bring down a 20-point deficit to just eight heading into the final frame of action, but ultimately, it was not enough to deliver the win. He also went 3-of-4 from the charity stripe to give him a sterling 66.0 true shooting percentage to accompany his 28.4 usage rate, but aside from Jayson Tatum (21 points, two triples, three boards, three dimes and two steals), he didn’t receive much help from his teammates on the offensive end.

             Rozier added eight assists, five rebounds, one steal, one block and one turnover while he was out there, but he didn't get his first shot to drop until midway through the second quarter, and this was the second game in a row he failed to do much for Boston. As a team, the Celtics seriously struggled through the first half of action, connecting on just 23.8% of their attempts in the paint, which accounted for their worst performance through any half of basketball this season.

Milwaukee's second-unit thoroughly outplayed Boston's, and Thon Maker was also impressive in the win, coming through with eight points, two boards, two treys, one assist, five blocks and one turnover over 31 minutes.

The Bucks played some excellent team defense in this one, holding the Celtics to just 35 points on 30.2% shooting through the first half of action, and this certainly looks like a series that could go to seven games.

He did tweak his ankle during the fourth quarter after coming down on Aron Baynes’ foot, but his ankle didn’t turn all that much and he played through it, so he should be fine for Tuesday’s Game 5 in Boston.

             Hill is still listed as questionable with back spams, but this is a relief for Cleveland. Hill will continue to receive treatment and will be re-evaluated after warmups, so he's basically a game-time call. Coach Ty Lue said that Calderon will likely start if Hill can't play.

The Celtics are worried about Smart tweaking the injury if he returns too soon, so that's the holdup right now. ""I think it’s just a matter of you have to have that post-surgery healed enough to be able to take a hit even with a brace on it,"" Stevens added. Smart will be re-evaluated on Tuesday and has a legitimate shot of playing in Game 6 on Thursday.

             Obviously it's his first playoff triple-double, but he is the first Jazzman to notch one of those since John Stockton in 2001. He was on fire in the first half with 19 points, and he hit a massive 3-pointer at the buzzer to end the third. On the lighter side, Rubio had a man bun today, and it's worth a mention he's put up more points, boards and dimes while being more efficient and posting a 14.5 net rating when he has a man bun compared to without one (H/T SLC Dunk). Hairstyle stats aside, the Jazz are so hot right now.

             He couldn't keep his 25-plus scoring streak alive, but Mitchell was active on defense and wasn't forcing shots while  Ricky Rubio was rolling. Mitchell said before the game that he's still not 100 percent over his foot injury from Game 1, but he's been explosive as ever. Today was a good day for two incredible rookies to sandwich an action-packed Saturday slate of NBA action.

             He had such a huge impact on this game with putting fouls on Steven Adams and just owning the paint on the defensive side. Offensively, he continues to set high screens to set the halfcourt offense, and he picked up five offensive boards today. Gobert isn't going to lead the Jazz in scoring in just about all the games this season, but his presence on both ends makes the Jazz who they are. Don't be surprise to see the Jazz take this series.

             Yeah, OKC gets a lot of blame for continuing to leave Ingles open in the corner because they were helping too hard on the weak side. Ingles may not have the prettiest shot, but he made 44.0 percent from deep this year and 44.1 percent from last season.

             Rudy Gobert's rim protection neutralized Westbrook's driving in a big way, and Westbrook was not at his best against Ricky Rubio or on defensive rotations -- the whole team, basically. Westbrook has struggled down the stretch for two games straight, which is a problem for a guy that sucks up so much usage. OKC is in trouble.

Adams is vastly underrated for this team and you can bet the Jazz will be attacking him to get him in foul trouble after the success they had on him during this easy win.

Perhaps the PG-related highlight from this game is the Utah crowd chanting ""push-off P"" with some fouls called against him.

             The Wolves are alive as they earn their first home playoff win since 2004. As for Butler, he did tweak his left ankle in the second quarter as he landed on someone's foot going for a rebound. Butler stayed in the game, but he did look a step slow to start the third quarter before really heating up later. Butler has described himself as one of the toughest in the NBA, so it would be a shock to see him have limitations on Monday. We have a series.

             This was not the regular-season Wiggins, especially going 4-of-6 from deep. Plus, his five dimes match his best output in that category all season while he was effective on defense. If the Wolves can somehow get this output from Wiggins in this series, the Rockets may have a tougher time closing out than almost anyone thought.

The Rockets have made it clear they don't want KAT to beat them after he averaged just 6.5 points in the first two games, but so many players getting it going for the Wolves made it tougher to key in on Towns.

            James Harden scored 29 points with seven rebounds, seven assists, one steal and three 3-pointers in 36 minutes against the Wolves during a Game 3 121-105 loss on Saturday.
        
        
             The offense wasn't the problem for the Rockets, but Harden didn't get much help from the starting frontcourt with a combined 17 points from Trevor Ariza, P.J. Tucker and Clint Capela. Harden was defended well in this game and it could get easier for the Wolves if the Houston role players step up. Game 4 is Monday at Target Center.

             It was one of his worst defensive games in a while, and the ""Chris Paul is bad in the playoffs"" crowd has some fuel to get them to Game 4. CP3 still looked great on offense, but Jeff Teague absolutely got the best of him here.

Anderson will likely be looking at around 20 minutes in Game 4.

             Stein adds that Orlando would pounce on coach Stotts immediately. Despite Stotts getting his rear handed to him in this series, he's one of the best coaches in the NBA for Xs and Os, and of course he led the Blazers to a No. 3 seed in the stacked Western Conference.

             He is expected to receive treatment for his back spasms. Hill was playing every well in the first quarter and it was a mild surprise that he didn't get much run in the second half, so this likely explains it. If he can't go, we will likely see some Jose Calderon in the first unit or Cedi Osman could start with LeBron James at the point.

In these four games, he put up monster numbers, averaging 33.0 points, 12.0 boards, 1.8 steals, 2.8 blocks and 0.8 treys in 38.8 minutes per outing. After the game, AD said he was excited for the Warriors in the next round because the Dubs swept him back in 2015. He'll see a combination of Kevin Durant, Draymond Green, Kevon Looney and more in what should be one of the most fun series in the second round.

             If this season taught us one thing, never underestimate Jrue Holiday again. He was unstoppable on drives in this win going 9-of-9 within three feet while all of his dimes resulted in makes in the paint or treys. With how good Anthony Davis is, you could argue the Pelicans have the best duo in the playoffs right now -- it's a really tough argument these days. Plus, the AD-Jrue combo became just the second duo to score 40-plus each in a playoff since 2000 (Kyrie, LeBron). Holiday is likely going to have to guard Kevin Durant a lot in the next round, so he'll need to be on his A game for that one.

             He kept the Blazers in it with 25 points in the second half, but there was just too much Jrue Holiday and Anthony Davis. Overall this season, McCollum did take a step back this year after improvements in the previous two seasons, but he could improve at age 26. Additionally, the Blazers are kind of stuck with their roster as is, so there may be some trade rumors on one of the NBA's best shooting guards.

             He's almost certainly going to finish in the top five for MVP and he has an excellent shot to be First Team All-NBA, but he couldn't handle all the traps and doubles he saw in this series. Simply put, Lillard and C.J. McCollum need some help on the wing to help prevent teams from doing this routinely next season. Additionally, this isn't a coach Terry Stotts issue because of the lack of roster balance. Whatever happens, Dame will be a top-10 fantasy pick next year.

            Ben Simmons was the star of the show during a 106-102 Game 4 win in Miami on Saturday, scoring 17 points with 13 rebounds, 10 assists, four steals and seven turnovers in 39 minutes.
        
        
             He played the entire second half because coach Brett Brown seems to have lost faith in T.J. McConnell and Markelle Fultz, but Simmons didn't look tired one bit while out there -- a lot of fouls could've helped his wind. Simmons is just the fifth rookie to post a playoff triple-double and the first since 1980 (Magic Johnson). Simmons' domination late in games is a big reason why the 76ers have a ridiculous +40.0 net rating  in the fourth quarter in this series thanks to a 130.6 offensive rating. Some people may say The Process took too long, but you won't hear a single 76er fan complaining these days. TTP.

            Joel Embiid made 2-of-11 from the field and 10-of-13 from the line for 14 points against the Heat in a Game 4 win on Saturday, adding 12 rebounds, one assist, one steal, five blocks and eight turnovers.
        
        
             Besides his outstanding defense and the sloppy turnovers, a big story going forward is that Embiid clearly doesn't like playing with his mask and that may be part of the reason he made just 2-of-11 from the field. He apparently tried to sneak out on the court for an offensive possession to play without the mask and was fouled on a shot just seconds later, but coach Brett Brown was furious and forced Embiid to put the mask back on. Besides that, he is the first 76er with five blocks in a playoff game since Dikembe Mutumbo, and he's the first 76er with 10 free throw makes in consecutive games since Allen Iverson in 2003. If the 76ers can close out on Tuesday, maybe Embiid can have the mask off for the next round.

             He kept the Heat in this game with 12 points in the final frame, but he did miss a costly free throw with 17.6 seconds left as the Heat now have to overcome a 3-1 deficit. Miami just doesn't have the firepower to guard Ben Simmons and Joel Embiid at the same time, so the deck is stacked against them for Game 5 in Philly on Tuesday. As for Wade, he gets plenty of credit for his strong play down the stretch of games at age 36.

             He was actually engaged in the second half and part of that is thanks to Josh Richardson for hitting him on rolls to the rim. Whiteside did get late minutes in this game because of how Kelly Olynyk couldn't get into a rhythm due to foul trouble. Besides the loss factor and how he was crashing the boards when he didn't need to, his second-half run is about as encouraging as it gets after it looked like there was a chance he wasn't even going to hit 15 minutes based on his first stint today.

            Josh Richardson set a playoff franchise record with seven steals against the 76ers on Saturday, adding 10 points, five rebounds, seven assists and one 3-pointer in 35 minutes.
        
        
             He did suffer a left shoulder contusion in the second quarter, but he started the third quarter and looked fine. Richardson showed the mainstream NBA crowd that he's earned a First Team All-Defense nod with his outstanding instincts with his ball pressure and he's been able to guard four positions. Plus, he was a big part of getting Hassan Whiteside going on the offensive side in this close loss. His fantasy owners know he's a stud, but they'll have to pay up for him next year.

             Turner is getting over his toe injury and he will have a small metal plate in his shoe to protect this injury. It's also mildly interesting that Jusuf Nurkic is starting again after getting owned all series. Expect Turner and Shabazz Napier to play more minutes with Moe Harkless out.

             He'll almost certainly be starting with the Blazers needing someone to replace Moe Harkless. Besides Turner, Shabazz Napier could see some additional run and he may even be a candidate to start because the Blazers need to make some changes. Turner would be risky to play in DFS, but he has options.

The Blazers need some additional ball handlers to help out the backcourt, so we may see some extra Shabazz Napier to take pressure off Damian Lillard.

Smart was was given a 6-8 week timetable and the 27th would be six weeks. If he's back, he may still come off the bench because of how well Terry Rozier has played.

Thon Maker was one of the heroes for Game 3 with five blocks and 14 points, but he'll likely come off the bench behind Tyler Zeller. Jabari Parker is the clear winner here as the Bucks will go smaller more often.

If Hill is unable to suit up, Jose Calderon will likely draw the start at point guard, with Jordan Clarkson seeing an uptick in minutes off the bench. This is not an ideal scenario for the Cavs in what is essentially a must-win game.

However, he refuses to discuss his injuries. ""Nobody really cares if you're nicked up. If you put on that jersey and go out there and play, you've got to produce,"" said Butler. ""You've got to do what they got you here to do. So 40, 50, 95, 100 [percent], I'm out there playing. Nobody cares if I'm nicked up or not.""

             This is a mere formality, as it has long been assumed that Doncic would enter the 2018 draft, considering he is almost a lock to be a top-3 pick. He just turned 19 years old, yet is averaging 15.0 points, 5.2 rebounds, 4.7 assists, and 1.5 made 3-pointers in 24.9 minutes per game this season for Real Madrid. He projects as a terrific all-around fantasy contributor. His value for next season will depend greatly on which team drafts him.

             The incident took place in Game 3 on Thursday. It was assumed that Winslow would only be hit with a fine, and not a suspension. Game 3 was one of the best all-around games of Winslow's career. He finished with 19 points, ten rebounds, three assists, one steal, two blocks and four 3-pointers in 27 minutes. Miami will need him to continue stepping up if they want to knock off the Sixers.

             Since shaving his beard earlier this month, Mirotic has been a beast. Over the Pelicans final six regular-season contests, Mirotic averaged 25.8 points, 12.0 rebounds and 4.0 treys. He has remained red-hot in the playoffs. Over the first three games in New Orleans first-round matchup with the Blazers, he's averaging 21.0 points, 9.0 rebounds and 3.7 made 3-pointers. He will likely start gradually coming back down to earth, but Mirotic remains a strong DFS play for Game 4.

             For the umpteenth time, Giannis put Aron Baynes on a poster with a highlight-reel jam in the second half (video in link below). As expected, the Bucks did go with some Giannis at the five today, but it wasn't long because Thon Maker was hot. Giannis didn't get to the line today and his usage did drop overall. He'll likely have a bigger offensive output in Game 4 on Sunday.

He'll probably be sticking in the starting lineup after this big win, but his usage won't be high with his main offensive responsibility being to hit open jumpers. One other quick note: Brogdon was on the bike in the fourth quarter, so he may not be all the way back.

             He was knocking down open treys with plenty of pick-and-pop action, and he was terrific on help defense as the Celtics attacked the basket.

             Coach Scott Brooks said he wanted Scott out there in the second unit to combat the Toronto bench mob, and he came through with a +13 in plus-minus. Scott should continue to see minutes in the upper 20s and he may even see more run if Markieff Morris is in trouble for touching a ref.

             Coach Scott Brooks had faith in his starters and they came through for him. If Gortat did come off the bench, that would have likely meant that either Ian Mahinmi or Gortat would've been bumped from the rotation, so this win should secure Gortat as a starter for the next two games at least.

             The Raptors defense was not there today as they gave up 100 points in the first three quarters. Coach Dwane Casey may have made a mistake with some adjustments to take Lowry off the big dogs, Brad Beal and John Wall, which is something Lowry was doing a lot of in the first two games. His playing time has been high all series and he didn't play in garbage time, so expect him to be around 38-40 minutes in Game 4 on Sunday.

             He only got to the line two times in this game, which has been a slight trend since the middle of March.

             He was 11-of-15 from the field for a tidy 96.7 eFG% in this comeback win after the Pacers fell behind 57-40 at half. Bojan had the Rockets approach for scoring with all of his 11 makes coming either at the rim or from deep while several of his treys were well beyond the arc. He was also a star on the defensive end with on-ball pressure on LeBron James, which is even more impressive after he picked up two fouls in the first 2:30 of this win. He's been solid all season and he'll continue to be the most important defensive piece in what looks like will be a lengthy series.

             Bojan Bogdanovic will get all the credit as he should, but Thad turned in one of his best games in a while today. He was torched by LeBron James in Game 2 with 'Bron putting up a 100 eFG% on his nine attempts against him, but today Young made numerous defensive plays in the second half. He also kept Kevin Love whisper quiet in the second half while making some easy shots around the rim. The former Nets saved the day today, but don't expect it to happen too often.

             He did not have his shot today and he was 1-of-8 from deep, but the Pacers were able to pull out the comeback victory. The Cavs were trapping Oladipo more in this game, but he was able to get the ball to his teammates.  Oladipo is likely going to see a similar strategy against him in Game 3 and the Cavs will just hope Bojan Bogdanovic cools off on Sunday.

             This one hurts as the Cavs were up 57-40 at half and this loss is the first time all season they've blown a fourth-quarter lead -- they were 40-0 before today. The Cavs offense was a disaster in the second half and their defense fell off after a strong showing in the first half. Basically, every set was just giving LeBron the ball and hoping for a slightly-contested three. James scored 12 straight Cavs points in the fourth to keep his team in it, and the help that he had in the first half went away. LeBron has been sweeping first-round series for the previous five years and he's never lost a first-round series (12-0), but now he finds himself in a 1-2 hole.

             He had a strong first half with 16 points, but he totally disappeared in the second half until he hit a clutch 3-pointer with 7.6 seconds left to cut it to one. Besides the lack of offense, he was pushed around under the boards while his defense was sub-par as usual. Love's left hand didn't seem to bother him and he didn't have it wrapped during this game. He has to play better for the Cavs to advance out of the first round.

Brogdon could be a DFS option today.

             That's bad news for the Bucks because Henson has been solid and he's also been in six of the seven most-used lineups in this series. With him out, that should mean Tyler Zeller gets a bump in minutes, but the Bucks would almost certainly be looking to run out more lineups with Giannis Antetokounmpo at the five. That should open up minutes for Jabari Parker.

            Mike Scott is coming off the bench again for Game 3 on Friday.
        
        
             Coach Scott Brooks explained the move to keep Scott in the second unit. ""We need to counter their bench attack and Mike has been a big part of that,"" Brooks said. He's hit 27 minutes in each of the last two games with a 20-point game coming in Game 2. Expect him to get minutes in the 20s again and he could close, especially if the Wizards are trailing.

             There was a lot of talk of Mike Scott getting the start because of how well he's shot the ball, but coach Scott Brooks said he's still confident with his first unit. Plus, Gortat is among the league leaders for screen assists this season while he is tied with Clint Capela for the lead in screen assists per game this postseason, so taking him out would put more pressure on John Wall. Still, Gortat will be on a short leash today, so he's a risky DFS play.

It doesn't sound like he'll be ready for Game 1 against the Pelicans, but he should be back at some point in that series.

             Turner looked to have gone through portions of practice on Friday, so he may have a shot to play after sitting out for Game 3. The Blazers are going to need help on offense from players not named Damian Lillard because Dame continues to get trapped. Turner could be a DFS play, but not being 100 percent makes him risky.

Milwaukee might also choose to go small, and give Jabari Parker additional playing time.

             VanVleet returned to the Raps lineup for Game 2 on Tuesday, but logged just three minutes. Coach Dwane Casey said he ""just wasn't' ready."" However, FVV told reporters on Thursday that he plans to play in Game 3. ""You're gonna have to cut my arm off to get me to not feel like I can play,"" VanVleet said. C.J. Miles and Delon Wright have played very well off the bench, so Toronto hasn't missed VanVleet yet. We should have an update on his status after Friday's shootaround.

             ""It’s nothing,"" KD said. ""It was a quick roll. It didn’t completely turn. I’m fine."" He did go to the locker room just before the game ended, but the Warriors had the game in the bag. He may get treatment, but this ankle injury didn't look bad as he just lost his footing. Expect him to be a full go for a closeout game.

             He did tweak his left ankle as he was going for loose ball and he did not return. Although, he didn't have a bad limp and the Warriors had the game in hand. Ankle injuries have been a major problem for the Warriors this year, but for now this one doesn't sound serious. As for the Warriors team, they've now won 18 straight Western Conference games and will go for the sweep on Sunday.

             His defense was terrific in this game and he continues to see around 20 minutes per night. Looney is probably coming off the bench for Game 4, but he could be an option to start against the Pelicans. He's played really well for the last two months.

             The Spurs just don't have the offense right now and the Warriors know that limiting Aldridge likely means they'll be getting a win. San Antonio will try to avoid a sweep on Sunday night at home, but things aren't looking good for a team that typically makes a postseason run.

             He did have to go to the locker room at the end of the first quarter because of a minor left thumb injury, but returned for his normal playing time -- he checked out with 7:05 in the fourth thanks to garbage time. Davis did also take a shot to his right side near the basket, but he stayed in the game to shoot the free throws. The Pelicans have some important pieces around AD and their perimeter defense has made The Brow even more valuable as a rim protector. We might get a long series against the Warriors in the second round, assuming the Pelicans win just one more game in their series with the Blazers. Game 4 is at New Orleans on Saturday.

             All those Smoothie King Center struggles went away as Niko got off to a hot start to give the Pelicans a massive lead to start the game. He continues to be an outstanding fit with Anthony Davis and he continues to show he's more than just a perimeter player. Plus, his defense doesn't get enough attention. It'll be interesting to see how the Warriors guard him in the second round.

             Yeah, the Blazers are about done and a lot of it is on Dame. He keeps dribbling into double teams and Jrue Holiday has dominated him in basically every facet. Since Game 1, coach Terry Stotts has needed to find a way to get Dame off Jrue and it still hasn't happened yet. The Blazers are down 0-3 and will have to start a miracle comeback in New Orleans on Saturday.

Nurkic really shouldn't guard Anthony Davis at any point for the rest of this series and it wouldn't be a total shock to see him be a DNP-CD. You really can't use him in DFS because he'll be on a short leash.

             This hero should probably should get a cape to go with the mask. Embiid needed three masks to get through this game with Justise Winslow stepping on one, and a second one breaking after he was fouled on the baseline. Embiid's defensive impact was highly apparent as he changed shots, while he and Ben Simmons put up a whopping 135.0 offensive rating in 24 minutes together. It's also worth a mention that he didn't play the final 1:59, so Embiid was likely headed to 32 minutes had the game been close. With The Process back, a run the NBA Finals could be in the cards for Philly.

             He terrorized the Heat with cuts and drives to the basket, and the Heat really don't have anyone who can guard him. Simmons was also 7-of-8 from the line to up his postseason free throw shooting to 75.0 percent -- up from 56.0 in the regular season. He and Joel Embiid were incredible together today with 24 minutes together, posting a 135.0 offensive rating to get them to a +33.7 net rating.

            Marco Belinelli scored 21 points with four rebounds, five assists, one steal and four 3-pointers in 33 minutes against the Heat on Thursday.
        
        
             He takes some wild shots, but that's who he is and it's part of the reason Belinelli had the best offensive rating among 76ers rotation players in the regular season and why the 76ers offense looks great when he's out there. Plus, he's put up a 60 eFG% on his shots from 25-29 feet in the previous 17 games, so he gets them to go in. He'll have a few more big games as the 76ers make a run.

             He was going right at Marco Bellinelli in the third quarter to keep the Heat in it, but the 76ers severely outplayed Miami in the fourth with a 32-14 advantage. Dragic is likely going to be the main factor in the offense for the rest of this series. The Heat will basically have their season on the line for Saturday's Game 4

             He was on fire in the first half to get some added minutes throughout the game. Winslow's defense was the best on the team and he even had Dwyane Wade passing up open shots to get Winslow the rock on offense. He's been very good since the break and he will likely see more minutes in Game 4.

             Not good. He got worked in the post and he was late on a lot of help defense plays. Whiteside did get some fourth-quarter minutes, but he was on a very short leash with Joel Embiid working him while he was out there. He'll probably start Game 4, but he's not someone most DFS players should trust right now. His ADP will be sliding next year, too.

             Things are not going well for the Pistons right now and they've missed on basically every draft pick since SVG took over, especially taking Luke Kennard over Donovan Mitchell. Van Gundy has one year left on his contract, so it's possible they part ways.

Harkless was one of the Blazers' best players in March and he was a big part of their winning streak, so expect him to get all the minutes he can handle.

He doesn't have a formal minutes cap and his playing time will be based on his conditioning. Embiid is likely going to see a lot of Hassan Whiteside, and it's worth a mention he attempted more 3-pointers with Whiteside guarding him than any other player in the NBA this season (6-of-11, per NBA.com). Trust The Process.

            Chandler Parsons shared his thoughts on his disappointing 2017-18 season.
        
        
             ""I had moments this year where I felt good and felt like myself, and I had moments where the soreness and stiffness were just too much,"" Parsons said. ""I want to play. I want to be healthy. And I’m doing everything in my power to get there."" He averaged 7.9 points, 2.5 rebounds and 1.9 assists in 19.2 minutes, playing in a total of 35 games. Needless to say, the Grizzlies should be relieved that he's halfway through his four-year, $94 million contract.

             ""I came into the season, I don’t want to say without a role, but knowing that anything can happen,"" KOQ said. ""Whether it be trade talks or things like that, I think I handled it well by putting myself in a solid position where I could display what I could do."" His player option is worth roughly $4.2M, but he should be able to command a raise this summer after a strong finish to the season. After the All-Star break, KOQ averaged 8.7 points, 7.6 rebounds, 2.6 assists and 1.9 blocks in just 21.6 minutes.

             ""I’ve been told everything from December to him being out for the season, so I don’t know what to expect on that,"" Dolan said. ""But we can’t just sit on our a-- while he’s away. We need to develop a team and then integrate him into it when he comes back."" Porzingis tore his ACL back in February and there's no word of any setbacks, so it's unclear why Dolan is being so pessimistic. KP recently said he was hopeful to be ready for the start of the 2018-19 season, so take Dolan's comments with a grain of salt for now.

""Yeah, he was tentative,"" Casey said. ""It was just too tentative and just felt like we had to get him out and let him rest a little bit more, just see where he was. Just wasn't ready."" It's unclear if FVV will be able to handle his normal workload, so look for Delon Wright to step up if he's limited.

Marcin Gortat played just 12 minutes in Game 2 and has been ineffective in this series, while Mike Scott has been very impressive off the bench and is coming off a 20-point game with four triples. If Washington does make a change, Scott may not reveal it until after warmups.

The Wolves threw multiple defenders at Harden all night long and considering they held him to 11.1% percent shooting, it's a strategy we're likely to see again as the series shifts to Minnesota for Game 3 on Saturday.

             KAT was held to eight points on nine shots in Game 1 and the Wolves talked a lot about getting him going offensively, but that obviously didn't come to fruition. He was held to single-digit scoring just twice during the entire regular season and the fact that Houston has limited him in consecutive games is mind-boggling -- the Rockets did have the sixth-best Defensive Efficiency in the league this year, and their swarming defense has short-circuited the Wolves' offense. Towns and the Wolves will go back to the drawing board for Game 3 at the Target Center on Saturday.

             Rose dropped 16 points with four assists in a strong Game 1 performance but he couldn't duplicate the feat tonight -- at one point in the first half he had three consecutive shots blocked. The Wolves are in trouble if they're relying on D-Rose's bench contributions to upset the No. 1 seed Rockets.

             Cousins recently returned to his offseason home in Las Vegas, but he'll be rooting on his teammates in person as they look to take a dominant 3-0 series lead vs. the Blazers. His physical therapist will be traveling with him and he won't miss any rehab sessions, which he's been doing six days a week. As one of the biggest unrestricted free agents this offseason, Cousins' progress will be scrutinized even more than usual.

             Mitchell was a game-time decision after MRIs were negative for structural damage, but you couldn't tell he was injured by watching him play. He was instrumental in turning a 10-point deficit into a lead in the fourth quarter, and continues to reach new heights in his rookie season -- he and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar are the only players to score 27+ points in their first two playoff appearances. He's unreal.

             Favors had six offensive rebounds in the first half alone, finishing with eight boards on the offensive glass. He's having a solid season for Utah after battling injuries in recent years, and has quieted concerns about his ability to share the frontcourt with Rudy Gobert. Tonight's impressive 102-95 victory ties things up at 1-1 as the series shifts to Utah for Game 3.

            Ricky Rubio was terrific on Wednesday with 22 points on 6-of-16 shooting, nine assists, seven rebounds and one steal in a Game 2 victory at OKC.
        
        
             Rubio launched 18 shots in Utah's Game 1 defeat, which tied the third-most attempts he had in any regular season game this year. He wasn't shy tonight, either, and connected on 5-of-6 free throws while knocking down five 3-pointers. The triples tied Rubio's season high and helped Utah escape with a series-tying victory, despite the rest of the roster combining for 4-of-21 shooting from downtown. So far, so good for Rubio in his first postseason run.

             Gobert began the game 2-of-6 from the FT line but he made them when it mattered most, finishing 7-of-12 at the stripe. His job got easier with Steven Adams playing only 22 minutes due to foul trouble, before fouling out in the fourth quarter, and the battle at center remains a key to the series. Gobert shot just 54.4% on the road this season, compared to 68.8% during home games, so we're expecting some big performances in Games 3 and 4.

             George aggravated a hip/pelvis injury during Game 1 but his status was never in doubt. He was averaging 38.0 points on red-hot shooting in his previous two games, including the regular-season finale, but just couldn't find the range tonight in a tough 102-95 home loss. The Thunder will try to reclaim the series lead in Utah on Saturday.

             Adams began the game with a wrap around his right wrist and he was icing his arm throughout the game, presumably stemming from a play late in Game 1 when he hit his hand on the rim during a dunk. The injury was obviously bothering him, but coach Billy Donovan again dismissed any concerns and said he'll be fine for Game 3. We'll keep a close eye on his status but it would be shocking if he missed any time.

""We didn't want to overload his minutes [in Game 2],"" Stotts said. ""I wanted to be able to save his minutes in case we wanted to finish the game with him. If he played 6 to 8 minutes to start the game, that's it for the half."" Anyone building DFS lineups for Thursday should keep a close eye on Portland's lineup, especially with Evan Turner (toe) questionable to suit up.

He went just 7-of-17 from the field in a rare Game 1 defeat on Sunday, but it didn't take LBJ long to play another MVP-worthy game to get his team back on level terrain in the series.

             Green shot 0-of-7 during a disastrous Game 1 loss and it's no surprise that he was demoted tonight -- the Cavs also benched Rodney Hood, with J.R. Smith and Kyle Korver taking over the starting duties.

            Kyle Korver (foot, illness) moved into the starting lineup on Wednesday, scoring 12 points on 4-of-8 shooting with four 3-pointers, three rebounds, one assist and one steal in 31 minutes.
        
        
             Korver was limited to just four minutes on Wednesday but that was due to coach Ty Lue's rotations, and Lue waited until the last minute to reveal his lineups for Game 2. ""Being strategic in the playoffs, if you tell your lineup they can see what matchups they want to do and who's going to guard who,"" Lue said. We're expecting to see Korver start in Indiana on Friday.

             Smith and Kyle Korver slid into the starting lineup tonight, displacing Rodney Hood and Jeff Green, and the move resulted in a critical 100-97 victory. The results were less than stellar if you deployed Smith in DFS, of course, but inconsistency is nothing new for J.R. In 61 starts this season he averaged a modest 8.4 points on 39.3% shooting, 2.9 rebounds, 2.0 assists and 1.0 steals.

             Hood admitted that his rhythm was disrupted by early foul trouble in Game 1, and coach Ty Lue opted to go small with his starting lineup tonight. Given his dwindling role and lack of supporting stats, it's impossible to trust Hood for DFS and playoff-specific fantasy value.

             Hill's back tightened up on him recently but he played through the injury tonight, and the low minutes were due to pervasive foul trouble. Backup PG Jose Calderon wound up playing 13 minutes tonight and will continue to have a key role if Hill's back limits him going forward. For now we're assuming he'll be fine for Game 3 on Friday.

             Despite being forced to the bench down the stretch of a close game, coach Ty Lue said afterward, ""[Love] is good."" He broke his left hand earlier in the season but this injury was unrelated, as his thumb twisted awkwardly when hit by a pass from Victor Oladipo. We'll add him to the injury report for Friday's Game 3 but it sounds like he'll be ready to roll. If he is forced to miss time, Larry Nance and Jeff Green will be forced to step up and Tristan Thompson could reemerge in the rotation.

             Turner has found another gear in the postseason, shooting a combined 13-of-21 through two games to help Indiana split the first two games in Cleveland. That's even more striking in comparison to his ice-cold finish to the regular season -- he averaged 8.4 points on 36.0% shooting in the Pacers' final 13 games. He averaged more points (13.2) on better shooting (48.8%) away from Indiana this season, but hopefully he can stay hot at home on Friday.

             Collison hit a pair of huge 3-pointers to help Indiana trim the deficit to three points with 36.3 seconds remaining, but they couldn't get over the hump. The veteran led the NBA with ridiculous 46.4% shooting from deep this season, and Indiana may want to get him even more looks as the series shifts to Bankers Life Fieldhouse.

             Oladipo committed his second personal foul with 10:58 remaining in the first quarter and wound up playing just 28 minutes -- he averaged 34.0 per game during the regular season. The Pacers still split the first two games of the series 1-1, and they head back to Indiana with homecourt advantage on their side. With a 27-14 record at home this regular season, that could be a critical factor as the series unfolds.

             Rodney Hood and Jeff Green head to the bench as a consequence, which isn't a shock since both guys struggled during the Cavs' lopsided Game 1 defeat.

             Coach Ty Lue said he will wait until the last minute to reveal his lineups, so we may not know until after 7:00. Korver is expected to have a minutes limit, so he'll be a risky DFS play.

Mitchell went through shootaround this morning and he will have to test his foot out before the game. If he is limited, Royce O'Neale would likely have to see more minutes.

The Wizards are not getting much out of Gortat these days, but that would be a major switch for their offense because of how many 1-5 pick-and-roll plays they run with Gortat and John Wall. Scott is coming off a 20-point game, but changing roles could alter his efficiency.

Embiid is doing a little bit of contact already, and the 76ers should have another update at shootaround tomorrow. Coach Brett Brown has said Embiid's status is ""neutral"" to play, so he's likely a game-time call at best.

If Turner can't play, that could open up more minutes for Moe Harkless, who quietly has been one of the best Blazers in the last two months excluding his knee injury. Pat Connaughton and Shabazz Napier should also play slightly more.

For now, it sounds like the plan is to keep Anderson out for at least one more game.

             He's been limited by a stiff back, but he'll be good to go for Game 2 on Wednesday after originally being listed as questionable. Hill clearly wasn't himself in Game 1, scoring just seven points on seven shots in 18.5 minutes.

             His status hasn't been updated yet, but the 76ers are scheduled to practice later this evening. Embiid was limited to non-contact work at Tuesday's practice, and coach Brett Brown didn't reveal much about his progress. If Embiid isn't able to play, it's not clear if Ersan Ilyasova or Amir Johnson would start.

Barton also said that he wants to come back, but added that he wants to become a starter. ""We’re building something real special here,"" Barton said. He had a great season with averages of 15.7 points, 5.0 rebounds, 4.1 assists, 1.9 treys and 1.0 steals and should generate a lot of interest this offseason.

             Fizdale is also being considered by the Suns, but Mike Budenholzer is believed to be the favorite for that job. Fizdale is considered one of the best coaches available and it shouldn't be long before he's back on the sidelines. Mark Jackson, Jerry Stackhouse, Mike Woodson and David Blatt have all been linked to the Knicks as well.

             Budenholzer has two years and more than $13 million left on his contract in Atlanta, so the Suns may have to offer the Hawks some compensation if they choose to offer him the job. The Suns are also considering recently-fired coaches Steve Clifford (Charlotte), Frank Vogel (Orlando and Indiana), David Fizdale (Memphis) and David Blatt (Cleveland), but it's clear that Budenholzer is the favorite for the job.

             Rondo swished a dagger 3-pointer from the corner to cap a 9-0 run and gave the Pelicans a 108-100 lead with 39 seconds left that sealed the win. The Pels finished on a 12-2 run and won by a final score of 111-102, stealing two games in Portland to take a 2-0 lead in the series. Rondo and Jrue Holiday have it out for Damian Lillard, and Lillard has yet to come up with an answer for them on either end of the floor. Rondo had six points, eight boards and 17 dimes in Game 1, and is now averaging 11 points, 9.0 rebounds and 13.0 assists in the series, and he'll look to keep it going on Thursday for Game 3 in New Orleans.

             Holiday's defense on Damian Lillard has been nothing short of spectacular, as Lillard's hit just 13-of-41 shots in his two games in this series. Holiday hit a monster 3-pointer with the game on the line tonight and is now averaging 27 points, 5.0 rebounds, 5.5 assists, 1.0 steals, 1.0 blocks and 1.5 3-pointers in the series. Holiday looks very motivated to play against Lillard and C.J. McCollum and could really take off with the next two games coming at home in New Orleans, starting on Thursday. If you want to take him as your first guard in DFS, it makes sense given how well he's playing right now.

             The first one happened when he fell out of bounds and stepped on someone's foot, and the second one came in the fourth quarter when he just misstepped. The ankle could swell tomorrow, so make sure he's good to go for Thursday's home Game 3 before putting him in your lineup. Mirotic is averaging 16.5 points, 9.5 rebounds, 3.0 blocks and 3.5 3-pointers in the first two games of this series, both won by the Pelicans on the road.

             He saw 14 minutes in Game 1 and was effective, and it's possible the Blazers turn to him in Game 3 now that Damian Lillard has hit just 13-of-41 shots in the series. Napier's not going to start, and might not even play in Game 3, but with Lillard being stifled by the Pelicans' defense, it wouldn't be surprising to see Terry Stotts use Napier as a supplement to Lillard off the bench in Game 3.

             Starting center Jusuf Nurkic didn't return after suffering a left leg contusion, and while we expect him to be ready to go for Game 3, Collins would be an intriguing fantasy play if Nurkic can't go in that one.

            Moe Harkless returned from a 10-game absence after minor knee surgery and hit all five of his shots, including a 3-pointer, for 11 points, five rebounds and a block in Tuesday's Game 2 home loss to the Pelicans.
        
        
             Harkless could be in the starting lineup for Thursday's Game 3, or may come off the bench. Either way, he gave the Blazers a boost, although it wasn't big enough. After two home losses, the Blazers' backs are against the wall with the next two games in New Orleans, who has a 2-0 lead in the series.

             Jrue Holiday and Rajon Rondo appear to be motivated by playing against Lillard and C.J. McCollum, and Holiday now looks like one of the best two-way guards in these playoffs, as his defense has helped to stifle Lillard. Lillard was triple teamed at times tonight, but still managed to hit a big three-point and four-point play, the latter of which tied the game with 7:31 left in the fourth. Lillard started out 4-of-13 from the field tonight and the Blazers will have to find a way to free him up from the relentless New Orleans D that has held him to 13-of-41 shooting through the first two games. Game 3 is at New Orleans on Thursday.

             He returned to the bench and was expected to return, but it didn't happen. We'd be surprised if he doesn't start Game 3 on Thursday at New Orleans, and the Blazers fed him early and often tonight. Zach Collins played well in his absence and would be someone to target in DFS if the Nurk Alert can't go on Thursday.

             The Blazers now trail 2-0 after losing two home games and Aminu and company have a tough road to hoe going forward. Aminu did everything he could tonight after going for seven points and seven rebounds in Saturday's Game 1, and the Blazers will need him to stay hot if they're going to hang in this series. Game 3 is in New Orleans on Thursday.

             Despite a lack of actual news or reports, we already knew the relationship between Leonard and the Spurs might be severely strained, and Gregg Popovich's glowing shoutout to LaMarcus Aldridge after Monday's Game 2 appears to have been a jab lobbed directly at Leonard, as well. But the fact that Leonard won't be on the bench with his teammates again for Game 3 and isn't even returning calls or communicating with the Spurs takes things to a new level. The Bee also reports that several teams are putting together packages in hopes of acquiring Leonard in a trade this summer, and if things are as broken as Ailene Voisin's story make it sound, Leonard's days in San Antonio might really be over.

             Bledsoe was on fire and crushing it, including a triple-double on April 9, but he played just 11 minutes in the regular-season finale against the Sixers, and has struggled in both playoff games. He's hit just 9-of-25 shots in the two games in this series and hasn't looked like the same player he was in April, when he averaged a season-best 19.2 points, 4.2 rebounds, 6.7 assists, 1.7 steals and shot 57 percent from the field. He's got time to turn things around against the tough defense of the Celtics, but he better hurry. And when Bledsoe was asked after the game if he takes his matchup against Terry Rozier personally, Bledsoe responded ""Who?"" And went on to say he didn't even know who that was. Of course he did. The interview video is attached.

             Perhaps the most fascinating stat of these playoffs so far is the fact that Rozier has yet to commit a turnover in 78 minutes of this series. For a young player who probably wouldn't be starting if Kyrie Irving and Marcus Smart were healthy, Brad Stevens could not have hoped for anything more than what Rozier's given him all season. And if you're playing postseason fantasy, he should be a reliable and value-priced player, at least until the rest of the world catches up with him.

Giannis has now scored at least 30 points in four straight playoff games, including last season's first-round loss to the Raptors.

            Fred VanVleet played three minutes with his shoulder injury on Tuesday, but he didn't feel ""quite right"" tonight.
        
        
             C.J. Miles scored 18 points and the Raptors didn't really need FVV, who will hopefully feel better when Game 3 rolls around on Friday night. Consider VanVleet questionable for that one.

            C.J. Miles hit 5-of-7 shots, four 3-pointers and 4-of-4 free throws for 18 points and two rebounds in 22 minutes of Tuesday's Game 2 win over Washington.
        
        
             Miles occasionally will explode for a big game and he was feeling it tonight, but a lack of peripheral stats along with inconsistent scoring makes him a pretty shaky fantasy option. He averaged 10 points and 2.3 3-pointers during the regular season this year. He was also helped tonight by the fact that Fred VanVleet was limited to just three minutes due to a sore shoulder.

             Lowry hasn't exactly been killing it lately, scoring 13 or fewer points in four of his last five games, but he's been racking up a lot of assists, while his shot should start falling again any day now. Despite his recent offensive struggles, he's playing tough defense and remains one of the top fantasy point guard prospects in the NBA playoffs.

             John Wall was the only starter that played more than 30 minutes and the second unit pretty much kept this game from getting out of hand. The Wizards weren't getting anything from Marcin Gortat (zero points in 12 minutes), so the Wizards went small for most of the evening. Scott has now played 27 minutes in back-to-back games and it's clear that he's going to have a big role in this series. He can expect to get a raise this summer.

             DeRozan had been in a scoring drought recently, scoring 17 points in Game 1, with 19 and 16 points in his final two regular season games. He broke out of it in a big way tonight and the 3-pointers were nice to see. He averaged a career-best 1.1 3-pointers during the regular season and after two postseason games, he's averaging 2.5 triples per game. He's a top fantasy option and it looks like the Raptors have a decent chance to roll fairly deep into the Eastern playoffs.

Gortat played just 12 minutes and didn't score for the Wizards tonight.

             Wall added nine assists, four rebounds and one block, finishing 9-of-17 from the field and 11-of-11 from the line. He was also a stud in Game 1 with 23 points, 15 assists, three boards, four steals, two blocks and three triples, and he deserves credit for playing so well despite his knee not being 100 percent. Unfortunately for Washington, Wall didn't have much help tonight apart from Ty Lawson (yes, Ty Lawson), as Bradley Beal had nine points on 3-of-11 shots, Markieff Morris had six points and Marcin Gortat was scoreless in 12 minutes.

             Lawson was a +8 in the 11-point loss, shooting 4-of-10 from the field and 2-of-2 from the line. It was a surprise to see him check in ahead of Tomas Satoransky (three points, four rebounds and one assist in 15 minutes) and the Wizards also deployed him next to John Wall quite a bit. After this strong showing, expect Lawson to remain in the rotation for Game 3.

He's due to be reevaluated this weekend, at which point we should have more clarity on a return date, but for now he's targeting the second round of the playoffs if Golden State advances to play either Portland or New Orleans.

            Donovan Mitchell (bruised left foot) went through portions of Tuesday's practice and he remains questionable for Game 2.
        
        
             It's unclear whether Mitchell took contact but he was spotted taking pull-up jumpers off the dribble, which bodes well. He's dismissed the possibility that he'll miss Game 2 but it looks like he could be headed for a game-time decision. We'll know more after Utah's shootaround on Wednesday.

            It seemed coach Gregg Popovich took a subtle shot at Kawhi Leonard (quad) during his postgame press conference following Monday's loss to the Warriors.
        
        
             Coach Pop spoke glowingly about LaMarcus Aldridge after the defeat in Game 2. ""LaMarcus has been a monster all year long,"" said Popovich. ""He’s led our team at both ends of the floor. He doesn't complain about a darn thing out on the court. He just plays through everything. I can't imagine being more proud of a player as far as playing through adversity and being there for his teammates night after night after night."" It's not much of a reach to conclude that Pop, while praising Aldrige, was also subtly sending a message to Leonard, who is not with the team as he rehabs in New York.

             Anderson missed the final four games of the regular season and Game 1 of the playoffs after spraining his left ankle back on April 3rd. Anderson was in uniform Sunday's contest, but coach Mike D'Antoni said he was not quite ready to return to game action. We should have another update on Anderson's status after Wednesday morning's shootaround. With Luc Mbah a Moute (shoulder) sidelined, Anderson could provide some valuable minutes off the bench

             VanVleet was initially listed as questionable, and it was reported earlier today that he had participated in shootaround and would be a game-time decision for Game 2. While FVV is making progress, the Raps want to make sure he's as close to 100 percent as possible before bringing him back. Delon Wright was excellent off the bench in Game 1, finishing with 18 points, four assists and three steals in 25 minutes. Wright will likely see 20-plus minutes again in Game 2 if VanVleet is ruled out.

Embiid was not made available to the media after Tuesday's practice. Clearly, he wants to get back on the floor for Game 3. It will be very interesting to see if the Sixers medical staff clears him for that contest on Thursday night.

""A lot of people think that if you do decide to go out, it's because you weren't supposed to be able to play no more. It's not always supposed to be that,"" said Wade.

            Moe Harkless (knee) is listed as questionable for Tuesday's game vs. the Pelicans.
        
        
             Harkless, who had arthroscopic knee surgery in late March, has been making progress and was able to participate in portions of Monday's light practice. We should have an update on his status for Game 2 following Tuesday morning's shootaround.

             Green was called for a Flagrant 1 foul against Davis Bertans late in the fourth quarter, which was his fifth personal foul after picking up a couple very early in the game. He was barking like a mad man after Bertans missed the first free throw, but managed to avoid any further discipline or an ejection. He did follow that act up with an airball from 3-point land, but Green did what he needed to do tonight and the Warriors smell blood in the water after taking a 2-0 lead over the Kawhi-less Spurs. Green is good to go.

             Klay Thompson was just as impressive, hitting 12-of-20 shots and five 3-pointers for 31 points and five assists in 39 minutes. The Warriors are rolling along without Stephen Curry and might be able to sweep the Spurs, even without him. Both Durant and Thompson's numbers might take a bit of a hit once Curry is back from his knee injury and rolling, but if you ended up with either of them in a postseason fantasy league, you've got to be pleased thus far.

             Dejounte Murray was nearly just as disappointing with four points, zero assists and two steals in 13 minutes, and the postseason Spurs look a lot like the regular-season Spurs. All of them are impossible to trust except for LaMarcus Aldridge.

             The move worked out well for the Spurs, who at least hung in this game and held a small halftime lead, but the only thing that can possibly save the Spurs at this point is the return of Kawhi Leonard (quad), which isn't likely to happen. The Spurs may get new life with Games 3 and 4 in San Antonio, where they held a 33-8 record in the regular season, but the odds of them advancing are not good.

             Aldridge was great and Patty Mills scored 21, but it's hard to see the Spurs hanging with the Warriors without Kawhi Leonard (quad). This was a nice opportunity for the Spurs, as they led by seven at halftime, but the Warriors finished out strong in the second half and won handily. Game 3 is in San Antonio on Thursday, and it's important to keep in mind the Warriors still don't have Stephen Curry (knee), who should be back in Round 2 or 3. The Spurs were 33-8 at home this year, so they've got a chance in Games 3 and 4, but it feels like the Warriors are too young and quick to lose this series.

             He was in a lot of pain and went to the locker room, but ran back out to the bench shortly thereafter. He didn't return, as the Warriors didn't need him down the stretch, and he'll be questionable for Game 3 on Thursday in San Antonio. West isn't really a fantasy factor, but he is a key bench player for the Warriors.

             This is going to put some unwanted pressure on the Sixers to not only have to answer for the statement, but they'll also feel some pressure to play him, even if they're not ready to turn him loose. Embiid's possibly the best social media presence in professional sports and while this one may not go over as well as some of his attempts at comedy, he should be back on the court sooner than later. The soon to be masked man is questionable for Game 3 on Thursday in Miami.

             One of his 3-pointers was a big one late in the fourth quarter, and he put up one of the best fantasy lines of the playoffs so far. He really struggled for much of December, January and February in the regular season, but finished up strong with a big March and respectable April. He's played well in both games in this series and will look to keep it going at home on Thursday.

             The Sixers started Ersan Ilyasova at center tonight and Whiteside was also in foul trouble. But it seems like he's too good of a player to not be a factor the rest of the way. If you've got him in a playoff league, he's off to a rough start after getting just 12 minutes in Game 1, but his minutes will have to rise once Joel Embiid is cleared to play. The Heat just have to hope his head and heart are still in it when he finally gets the opportunity he wants.

             Wade was on fire in the first half and helped the Heat outscore the Sixers 34-13 in the second quarter. He finished by hitting 11-of-18 shots and 6-of-8 free throws for 28 points, seven rebounds, three assists and two steals, and added a steal and dunk in the fourth quarter, a great pass to James Johnson, and a dagger jumper with 43 seconds left in the game. Wade was gassed, but still came through in the fourth, when Philly was chucking ill-advised shots and turning the ball over too often. Game 3 is Thursday in Miami. Wade's 28 were a team record for points off the bench in a Heat playoff game.

             The Heat were determined not to let Redick burn them again and he was rarely open from beyond the arc. He also hit just 2-of-4 free throws, not that it mattered. The Sixers will likely try to gameplan to get Redick open more often in Game 3, and they'll need better performances from Redick and Robert Covington (3-of-12, two turnovers) on Thursday.

             Oddly, he didn't hit a 3-pointer tonight, as the Heat's defense seemed to key on stopping the Sixers from getting open looks from downtown. Ilyasova also came off the bench to start the second half, but also did a nice job of playing most of the fourth quarter with five fouls. And while he made some big plays, the Sixers were never able to overcome the second quarter, which the Heat won 34-13 behind a big night from Dwyane Wade.

             Saric was in foul trouble for most of the second half but was able to stay on the court and hit some big shots. In the end, the Sixers had too many late turnovers and took some crazy shots that didn't fall, giving the Heat the win to tie the series at 1-1. Saric's fantasy line was tasty tonight and he's going to be a big factor for Philly, with or without Joel Embiid.

            Ben Simmons hit 10-of-17 shots for 24 points, eight rebounds, seven assists and two blocks in 39 minutes of Monday's 110-100 loss to the Heat, evening their series at 1-1.
        
        
             This was the first Sixers loss since March 13, snapping a streak of 17 straight wins. The Heat stepped up their defensive game tonight and while the Sixers were able to overcome being outscored 34-13 in the second quarter and make it a game, Dwyane Wade's heroics were just too much for the Sixers to handle. Simmons was great, as usual, but the Sixers will now get ready to try to bounce back in Game 3 on Thursday in Miami.

""They're trying to be physical with him on his post-ups but he's seen that a lot of times before."" The Cavs were beat in most aspects of the game on Sunday and they'll need a lot more from their All-Stars in Game 2, especially if George Hill (back) and Kyle Korver (foot, illness) are limited.

For what it's worth, George said on Sunday that he will be ready for Game 2.

             Utah's defense was unusually porous during their Game 1 loss in OKC, and they had a particularly tough time checking Paul George, who scored 36 points on 13-of-20 shooting. And when George was asked about his defensive assignment vs. Ingles, he replied, ""Just pressure him. It's very, very unlikely [Ingles] will beat me off the dribble.

             Before the game, Wolves coach Tom Thibodeau suggested that Harden's defense is ""very underrated,"" adding, ""He's got toughness, he's got size and he anticipates."" We're not sure the leading MVP candidate qualifies as 'underrated' in any aspect, but he lived up to Thibs' high praise with another completely dominant performance. If you exclude Clint Capela's terrific line, the rest of Houston's roster shot 14-of-42 (33.3%) from the field tonight -- Houston needed every ounce of Harden's two-way play to claim a 1-0 series lead.

             Capela made 10-of-15 FGs and 4-of-4 FTs tonight, and he had 20 & 10 before halftime to keep Houston in the lead despite lousy shooting from his teammates. Minnesota will go back to the drawing board for Game 2 and that could involve packing the paint more to limit Capela, but then the Rockets' 3-point shooters could have more space -- it's a 'pick your poison' situation defensively. The 23-year-old Capela outplayed Karl-Anthony Towns tonight, and that's saying something.

             The Rockets were playing without Ryan Anderson (ankle) and Luc Mbah a Moute (shoulder), which prompted coach Mike D'Antoni to say pre-game that Johnson would absorb some backup PF minutes. Tonight's limited production says enough about his lack of appeal for DFS value, especially with Anderson questionable for Game 2.

             CP3 committed six turnovers including a critical miscue with 8.7 seconds left in a three-point game. Only once during the regular season did he have more turnovers than assists, and this is also the second time all season that he's made one or fewer triples on at least six attempts. He sat out six of Houston's final 11 games to rest and allow a sore left hip to fully heal, so maybe he was just scraping off some rust. We're anticipating a more typical performance during Game 2 on Wednesday.

             Gordon didn't get to the free-throw line and he wasn't the only Rockets player to struggle from downtown. Trevor Ariza, P.J. Tucker, Chris Paul and Gerald Green combined for a 2-of-18 mark from deep, which is almost unthinkable. The Wolves allowed opponents to shoot 36.6% from deep this season (13th-highest in the league) and we're expecting these guys to find the range sooner rather than later.

             ""He’s going to get double-doubles,"" Rockets coach Mike D'Antoni said before the game. ""You can’t take away his post-ups and his moves in there. He’s going to score on anybody."" As it turned out, the Wolves were strangely incapable of exploiting KAT's advantages in the post throughout the game, and the league leader in double-doubles fell short of the mark tonight. Clint Capela was terrific and deserves credit defensively, but coach Tom Thibodeau should draw up plays to get Towns far more involved during Game 2.

             Bjelica was invisible over the Wolves' final three regular-season games, going 2-of-13 from the field while averaging 1.7 points. His time in the spotlight without Jimmy Butler was short-lived and he could fall out of the rotation entirely, based on tonight's dud.

Before the game, Teague said the Wolves ""have to push the ball and try to get some easy scores ... and we’re going to have to make some shots."" They finished with only 10 fastbreak points, while shooting 43.8% from the field, yet they still had a chance to tie it up on the final possession. The Wolves will need a big series from Teague to upset the No. 1 seed Rockets.

             Rose came in averaging 12.4 minutes in nine previous games with the Wolves, but coach Tom Thibodeau's faith was rewarded tonight. It helped that Jeff Teague was in early foul trouble and there was no way to foresee this scoring -- Rose hadn't scored more than 14 points in a game since Nov. 3, when he was playing with Cleveland. Even if Rose gets a similar workload on Wednesday, we're not expecting a repeat performance.

They fell short but Burks' hot play at least gives coach Quin Snyder something to think about prior to Game 2. He's still unlikely to crack the rotation unless Donovan Mitchell's left foot injury ultimately limits him.

             Rubio's 41.8% shooting this season was actually a career high, as was his 35.2% shooting from deep, but the Thunder were more than happy to have him launch the second-most shots of any Jazz player tonight. Rubio is in his seventh NBA season and he's played at the highest levels internationally, of course, so the playoff spotlight won't faze him -- and if his shots had fallen tonight, this would have been a tremendous overall stat line.

            Donovan Mitchell exited Sunday's game due to ""left foot soreness,"" but he returned to finish with 27 points on 11-of-22 shooting, 10 boards, three assists, three 3-pointers, two steals and one block in 35 minutes.
        
        
             Utah lost the game but the bigger issue is Mitchell's health going forward in the series. X-rays were negative on his left pinkie toe but he was limited once checking back in during the fourth quarter, and eventually left for good with the game out of reach. The good news is that coach Quin Snyder expects Mitchell to be ready for Game 2, Mitchell said he feels ""fine ... just stubbed [his] toe,"" and Utah has two days off before playing on Wednesday. Despite the late injury, Mitchell finishes as the first player since LeBron James to have 25+ points and 10+ rebounds in a postseason debut. We should have multiple updates on his status over the next 48 hours.

             Melo shot 5-of-13 from the field and 3-of-4 from the line, and more offense wasn't needed with Paul George (36 points) and Russell Westbrook (29 points) carrying the load. The takeaway for playoff fantasy leagues is that Melo filled up the defense stats -- he didn't have more than four combined steals and blocks in any game during the regular season.

             The only caveat is that Adams appeared to injure his right hand/wrist after a dunk in the fourth quarter -- we'll add him to the injury report as a precaution, but he should be fine for Game 2. His rebounding and paint presence are a key in this series, though we're not expecting to see any offensive fireworks -- Rudy Gobert led all qualifying players in Defensive Rating this season, allowing 97.7 points per 100 possessions while he was on the court. OKC will be more than satisfied if Adams can play the matchup to a draw.

             Brewer limped off with a right knee sprain during the season finale last Wednesday, but he looked fine despite a heavy workload tonight. Oklahoma City went 11-5 in games Brewer started during the regular season, and he provides a defensive presence while also stretching the court and thriving in transition, so it's great to see him healthy for the playoffs.

             Abrines didn't play in the regular-season finale vs. Memphis on Wednesday, but his hot shooting from downtown helped buoy a strong bench effort -- the Thunder fell behind 16-4 to begin the game, but once they took the lead they never relinquished it. Despite tonight's line, OKC's offensive usage is so heavily concentrated in the starters that it's impossible to trust Abrines for DFS value.

             Before the series, George referred to his postseason persona as ""Playoff P"", adding, ""It's a fun person to watch. It's an out-of-body person where I just lock in and put myself into a different zone."" He was in that zone at both ends tonight, and he carried OKC's offense early with 20 points during the first half alone. He started taking heat-check triples with his team up double-digits in the second half, drained a buzzer-beater to end the third quarter, and the Thunder never looked back in a 116-108 home win. The only negative is that Playoff P suffered ""muscle tightness"" in his back tonight, according to coach Billy Donovan, so we'll keep a close watch on his status prior to Game 2 on Wednesday.

When asked about Whiteside's ability to defend small lineups from Philly, Spoelstra replied, ""That’s what he’s been working on all season is to play shooting bigs and still find ways to impact our team positively at the rim. It’s a challenge with all their shooting."" Whiteside played only 12 minutes in Game 1, while Kelly Olynyk was extremely effective, but it sounds like Miami will at least field the same starting five on Monday.

""With where we are now, he's going to be more of a featured scorer and facilitate and guard Giannis and do everything. He'll probably run our film session tomorrow.""

I played well for a stretch or two but I still think my best basketball is ahead of me."" Lopez added that he needs to find a better balance between his 3-point game and low-post game, something that became increasingly obvious as the Lakers season progressed. The big man had previously said he'd be open to re-signing with the Lakers in the right situation, but there are too many variables in play to meaningfully read into those comments at this time.

             BB wasn't exactly firing pellets, finishing just 5-of-17 from the field, including 1-of-6 from behind the 3-point line. He did add six boards and three steals to his line, so at least it wasn't a total loss from a fantasy standpoint. The most promising statistic is that Bogdanovic logged 39 minutes in a decidedly one-sided regulation game, as that bodes well for his playing time as the series progresses.

             Turner played 33.5 minutes and offered a very promising quote after the game. ""I have a refreshed mindset, I need to make myself a presence and am going to continue to do that."" The Pacers are going to be a problem if Turner can complement Oladipo offensively on a consistent basis. It's only been one game, but so far, so good for Indiana.

             Some might point out the fact that Dipo was just 4-of-8 from the charity stripe, and others might respond with an eye roll. Oladipo was nothing short of phenomenal in his 2018 postseason debut, and the biggest takeaway was that the Cavs simply had no answers to slow him down. We'll see if that changes in Game 2.

             Korver was expected to be on a minutes limit, but he played just 3.5 minutes and didn't register a single statistic beyond his sole turnover. Impressively, he was -10 in his short time on the floor, and it's obvious that his foot isn't quite right. If this is the version of Korver the Cavs currently have available, the veteran might not even be in the rotation for Game 2. Stay tuned.

Whether he starts or comes off the bench, it's clear that Nance is well ahead of Tristan Thompson (no points, two minutes) in the rotation.

             There was no revenge game here for Hill, who played less than half of the available minutes and was a -14 during his time on the court. After the game, Ty Lue revealed Hill's back was too stiff to play much in the second half, so we're putting him on the injury report as a precaution. Like the rest of his teammates not named LeBron, Hill will need to be a lot better if the Cavs are going to make it past the Pacers, let alone reach the NBA Finals once again.

             LeBron certainly did his part with 24 points, 10 rebounds, 12 assists, a steal, and a block, but the rest of Cleveland's starting five scored just 25 points on a combined 30 shots. James wasn't terribly efficient with a 7-of-17 shooting effort—including 10-of-14 from the free throw line—but blaming him for this one is the wrong route to take. The Cavs need to look inward if they're going to advance out of the first round.

McCaw also admitted that he's still haunted by the devastating fall and is just glad he can still walk after temporarily losing sensation in his lower half, so the mental recovery aspect will be very real for the second-year pro as well.

             This is notable with Embiid already being ruled out of Monday's Game 2 and targeting a potential return in Thursday's Game 3. Currently, Embiid is limited to participating in individual workouts as well as team shooting drills. We'll be sure to bring you every step of Embiid's progress along the way as he continues to recover.

            Kawhi Leonard (quad) is not expected to return at any point during the postseason, sources told Shams Charania of Yahoo Sports.
        
        
             This is the third non-update we've received on Leonard in the last three hours, and hopefully, it's our final one for a while. This entire storyline has become ridiculously exhausting, and at no point have we received any legitimate news on where Leonard actually stands in his rehab. Per Shams, Leonard is still rehabbing in New York and has not been cleared by his doctors, though Charania does add the detail that Leonard's rehab has been in ""collaboration and with the approval of the Spurs' medical staff."" You might get a different answer on that last nugget dependent upon who you'd ask, but it's clear we shouldn't be expecting a Willis Reed moment from Leonard in these playoffs.

             You might not have known starter Tony Snell (two points on four shots in 33 minutes)  played today without looking at the box score, and it will be interesting to see if Milwaukee considers moving Brogdon into the first five as an adjustment ahead of Game 2 vs. Boston. Regardless of his role, Brogdon figures to play 30-plus minutes per night for as long as the Bucks stay alive.

For what it's worth, fellow starting guard Tony Snell finished with just two points, three rebounds, and a block in 33 minutes while Malcolm Brogdon notched 16 points, four boards, three assists, a steal, and two triples in 32.5 minutes off the bench.

The craziest part? The Celtics actually did a good job containing the superstar, something we don't say often when a player goes for a 35/13/7 line. As an aside, it's not a good sign for the Bucks that the team lost their opening playoff game with Antetokounmpo and Khris Middleton combining for 66 points on 23-of-41 (56.1%) shooting.

Although Morris wasn't terribly efficient from the field (8-of-20 shooting) in this one, we'd expect he'll continue to have the green light given the Celtics need his offense off the bench.

Scary Terry also had four boards, three assists, four triples, and a steal while finishing 5-of-6 from the charity stripe.

Tatum played 44 of a possible 53 minutes, and we'd expect him to remain heavily involved as long as Boston remains in the playoff picture. Tatum is a strong fantasy asset in playoff leagues.

             This was a predictable development after Gregg Popovich's comment to defer all Kawhi-related questions to Leonard and his team, and it really means nothing new in the grand scheme of things. We'll continue our standoff between Leonard's camp and the Spurs in what has been one of the weirdest seasons in San Antonio's recent history.

            Al Horford was enormous in Boston's insane Game 1 overtime victory against Milwaukee, finishing with 24 points, 12 rebounds, four assists, two steals, three blocks, and a three on 5-of-8 shooting.
        
        
             In addition to scoring 24 points on eight shots, Horford shot 13-of-14 from the charity stripe and had the unenviable task of defending Giannis Antetokounmpo. In other words, Big Al was nothing short of fantastic on both ends of the floor, and anyone critiquing Horford's style of play was emphatically silenced today. Boston will need more of this from Horford if the Celtics are going to make a deep playoff push without Kyrie Irving (knee surgery) at their disposal.

             Caldwell-Pope posted career-best marks in field goal percentage (42.6%), three-point field goal percentage (38.3%), three-point field goals (2.1) rebounds (5.2), and tied his career-high mark in steals (1.4), but he took a slight step back in scoring (13.4), assists (2.2), and free throw percentage (78.9%). It's anyone's guess where KCP winds up given the Lakers uncertain summer ahead, and it may again be a difficult free agent market for Caldwell-Pope to navigate in the search of a multi-year deal. A reunion with the Lakers isn't completely out of the question, though we're a long way from that potential scenario playing out.

             Smart took part in shooting drills on Sunday for the first time since undergoing surgery last month, a huge step in the right direction in his recovery. ""Today was the first day with the new splint on to actually get out here and do something. So the thumb felt well,"" Smart said. ""We're on track for [a return in the] next three weeks, possibly Game 7 of the first round, [but] definitely second round. So we're on the right path,"" he added. A report on April 9 stated that Smart was targeting a potential return on or around April 27, so this new update meshes with the previous timeline nicely. For what it's worth, Game 7 (if necessary) would be scheduled for Saturday, April 28. Smart's return will only help a Celtics backcourt that will be without Kyrie Irving (knee surgery) for the rest of the way.

             Anthony Davis also praised Rondo, saying he was in a ""different mindset"" to start the opening round of the playoffs. Rondo finished with 17 assists, but it was his communication on defense that prompted the praise from Mirotic. ""Defensively, he was talking to our guys all game,"" Mirotic said. ""Every time he knew what [Portland] was running, so he was telling us, ‘Here comes the pindown. Now it’s a flare [screen].’ He was a huge piece. That’s why we won this game."" Rondo played 39.5 minutes in the New Orleans victory, and we'd expect him to continue logging heavy minutes as the postseason progresses.

            When asked about the potential Round 1 availability of Kawhi Leonard (quad), Spurs coach Gregg Popovich said, ""you'll have to ask Kawhi and his group that question.""
        
        
             If there was any lingering idea that the Spurs have information the rest of us don't, Popovich's  answer speaks to that conspiracy theory emphatically. The bottom line is that we don't expect to see Leonard in the postseason, and Kawhi is going to have some very large and important questions to answer when he ultimately faces the media. The longer this mysterious injury saga extends, the worse it looks for Leonard. Don't expect those trade rumors to suddenly fade away. If anything, they're set to intensify.

             The fact that Lue felt the need to vocalize this is interesting and as dominant as playoff LeBron can be, the Cavs are going to need more than just James if they're going to again reach the NBA Finals. If Love struggles to make an impact vs. the Pacers, we could have a very interesting first-round series.

             Hood was held out of the final 2.5 games with soreness in his Achilles, but it was considered just a precaution. There's no word on any restrictions, and he's probably looking at minutes in the 20s. George Hill, LeBron James, Jeff Green and Kevin Love are the other starters. Kyle Korver (foot) will be on a minutes restriction.

             Kupchak and Messina have worked together prior when Messina was an assistant on Mike Brown's Lakers staff, so there is some familiarity here. This is the first name we've heard connected to the job since Steve Clifford's dismissal earlier in the week, and we're certain we'll be hearing about more candidates in the coming days/weeks ahead.

Whiteside went on a tirade towards the end of March due to his lack of playing time, but he handled things like a professional this time around. Coach Erik Spoelstra said his decision wasn't about Whiteside and added that it was simply a matchup tweak. We'll see what happens in Game 2.

            Trey Lyles said he's focused on earning more playing time in 2018-19.
        
        
             ""I’m not perfect at anything,"" Lyles said. ""I really want to improve in ways that makes coach keep me on the floor."" Lyles' first season in Denver was a mixed bag, and while he had some great moments when Paul Millsap was sidelined with a wrist injury, he disappeared when the Nuggets were at full strength. We like his chances of being the first big off the bench next season, but it's hard to get excited about his outlook with Millsap in town.

             ""I have no idea,""he said. ""That is out of my control. I am just going to focus on getting better as a player. That is really all you can do. I don’t know what they are going to do."" Walker has one year remaining on his four-year, $48 million contract, and we already know that the Hornets entertained offers for him at the deadline. Walker recently said that he'd like to play for a winner when he hits free agency in 2019, so the Hornets risk losing him for nothing unless they turn things around quickly. New general manager Mitch Kupchak has his work cut out for him.

             In his sixth season, Davis finally earns his first postseason victory. He terrorized the Blazers on defense and the Blazers couldn't stop him on the other end. Davis also took 10 shots outside of the paint and was able to keep his fouls down early. He's gone off basically every night and now he'll be getting 40 minutes per game. He'll probably be dropping a 40-point game in this series.

             He was a Blazer killer last season with two 20-point games that came out of nowhere, and he closed out in this game. It was a somewhat surprising move because E'Twaun Moore was very strong on defense against C.J. McCollum. Clark should see minutes in the mid-20s in this series.

            Jrue Holiday brought the defense against the Blazers during a 97-95 win on Saturday, scoring 21 points with seven rebounds, two assists, one steal, two blocks and one 3-pointer in 39 minutes.
        
        
             He's a good bet to be on an All-Defense team and that was the highlight of the night for Holiday, who defended Damian Lillard for most of his time out there. Holiday also had a big steal on C.J. McCollum just as the Blazers were looking to take a lead in the last minute, Holiday had a big stop on Dame with 12 seconds left and the Pelicans up one, and he blocked Pat Connaughton with five seconds left to ice this one. He probably won't make an All-NBA team, but Holiday has easily been a top-10 guard in the NBA this season.

             That ties the franchise record for most dimes in the postseason (Chris Paul). Rondo continues to play extremely well next to Anthony Davis and now we get the Playoff Rondo version. He'll likely get to 10 assists in every game during this series as he defends Evan Turner on the other end.

             Jrue Holiday locked him down all night with Dame making just 6-of-23 from the field. Both Dame and C.J. were ice cold with just three points combined in the first half while having their worst shooting half since they have started playing together. The Blazers almost pulled off a comeback with a 32-22 edge in the fourth, but late-play mistakes cost them. Coach Terry Stotts will have to figure out ways to get Jrue switched off Dame in Game 2.

             He was a no-show in the first half with no points and didn't score his first points until nine minutes left in the third, but McCollum hit multiple big shots in the fourth to keep the Blazers in it. McCollum is cold this month with only a 36.0 field goal percentage, including just 24.2 percent from deep over his previous six games. He'll have to play better if the Blazers want to turn this series around.

             That's quite a stat line and hitting 17/9/14 in a playoff game had never been done before for a rookie (basketballreference.com). The whole ""the 76ers don't have playoff experience"" narrative may have taken a hit here, and it's not like Ben Simmons is a rookie anyway, right Donovan Mitchell? Simmons was a little sloppy in the first half with five turnovers to tie his most turnovers in a half for his career, but he locked down in the third to help the 76ers win the third quarter 34-18. The Heat had no answer for him with Josh Richardson and James Johnson having a tough time. The 76ers have now won 17 games in a row and they could get Joel Embiid back for Game 2. Sam Hinkie is smiling somewhere right now.

             The scoring certainly jumps out, but Saric's hustle on defense was big time to create turnovers and force the Heat into tough shots. Saric's efficiency has been a major story on the year and him shooting 39.3 percent from deep has added another layer to this Philly offense.

Redick did have what was called a ""side"" injury in the first quarter, but he was able to return in the second half. He'll be making a big impact for the 76ers and it looks like he'll be worth that $23 million.

             You can't overstate what a great pickup Belinelli has been. Before this gem, he had a 63.1 TS% on a 24.1 usage rate in the last eight games without Joel Embiid in the lineup. He picked up a few early minutes because of a mild J.J. Redick side injury, and Belinelli was out there to close it out. While the add of Belinelli made sense to give Philly more shooting, he's been effective in other areas besides scoring, as well.

             If not for Olynyk, the Heat would've been out of this game in the third quarter. Hassan Whiteside was benched for almost the whole second quarter and also didn't play more than five minutes in the second half. Olynyk has stepped up in the playoffs before and the Heat were at their best when he was cruising back in March. He'll likely get minutes regardless, but Joel Embiid returning could throw a wrench in the Miami center rotation.

            Hassan Whiteside played just 12 minutes with two points, six rebounds, one assist and two blocks against the 76ers in Game 1 against the 76ers on Saturday.
        
        
             He did not seem too interested in this game with the 76ers attacking him for most of his time out there. Whiteside hasn't been pleased with being benched before, but he really can't defend how poorly he played today. Maybe he'll be more focused when Joel Embiid comes back, but DFS players probably shouldn't trust Whiteside at this point.

            Joel Embiid (face) said he thinks there's a ""pretty good chance"" he'll be able to play in Game 2 or 3.
        
        
             ""If it was my decision I would play, but I can’t get back out on the court if I don’t have the OK from them,"" Embiid said. ""But everything has been going well."" He also said he lost five pounds since missing time and he has been ramping up in the last few days. Embiid is expected to clear the concussion protocol tomorrow, and he wants to wear a black mask because the clear one that most players use gets foggy. If Embiid is back this soon, the chances of the 76ers making it to the NBA Finals has to increase.

             The Raptors finally shook off their Game 1 demons after losing 10 in a row in their last 10 series, which was an NBA record. The last time the Raptors won a Game 1 was way back in 2001, which is why Kyle Lowry said the team was approaching this game like a Game 7. As for Lowry today, this stat line isn't great, but he dictated the offense and he was a bulldog on defense. Plus, his minutes went up as expected.

             He did a little bit of everything to help him get extra minutes, including closing next to Bebe Noguiera. Ibaka's 33 minutes today are the most he's played in a game that ended in regular since Feb. 1 against these Wizards. If the Raptors get a strong series from Serge this could be a quick round.

             Obviously the Raptors did not miss Fred VanVleet (shoulder) today. Wright closed this game out and he was on John Wall for basically the entire fourth quarter, and he hit multiple clutch shots to help the Raptors pull away. VanVleet is likely going to play in Game 2, but Wright should still be able to find minutes with play like this. The Delon hive certainly will grow after this outstanding showing in what was really his first real chance at playoff minutes.

             He did hurt his right wrist in the fourth quarter as Delon Wright tried to take a charge on him, but Wall stayed in the game. Wall didn't have a great offensive game because Wright locked him up for a good portion of the entire game, especially late. With Wall getting to 39 minutes, it's obvious he won't have a minutes restriction in this series.

             The Wizards had two roll with a two-PF lineup throughout the game because of foul trouble to the centers. Scott is likely going to have a strong series to keep the Wizards in it because of how the Raptors second unit can make such an impact.

             He did hurt his left ankle late in the fourth quarter and limped to the bench, but he returned for the final two minutes. Morris' six dimes were a playoff career high and was a big part of keeping the Wizards in it, especially with how he had to play center early in the first quarter. For now, expect him to be ready for Game 2.

             He didn't look healthy in the first quarter and was limping in the first couple minutes. Porter wasn't looking to get shots like he had been for most of the last two months, but maybe that'll change as the series goes on. With John Wall out there, Porter's offensive upside isn't nearly as high.

             The jumper was working for a tidy 103.8 effective field goal percentage. Thompson was the game's leading scorer today and he'll likely have that distinction again with the Spurs having so many bad matchups. His perimeter defense was as good as usual to keep the Spurs out of the paint. With Stephen Curry out for the next week, Thompson should continue to see shots in the teens.

             He did suffer a minor left leg injury and had to go to the locker room just before half. Iguodala did start the second half and his playing time likely would've been higher had the Spurs been able to keep it close. Assuming he's healthy and the games are closer, expect Iguodala to be a big factor with around 30 minutes.

             The move to the bench was a big surprise, but he came out and hit his first shot. This move to the bench could help groom Cook for later in the postseason and even next year.

            JaVale McGee scored 15 points with four rebounds, one steal and two blocks in 16 minutes during his start against the Spurs on Saturday.
        
        
             He had a tremendous start in the first quarter and was able to keep LaMarcus Aldridge out of the paint. Coach Steve Kerr said he plans to stick with his center the whole way through the series even if the Spurs make a tweak, so expect McGee to start again with minutes in the teens. Playoff Pierre is back.

            Kevin Durant was terrific during a 113-92 win over the Spurs in Game 1 on Saturday, scoring 24 points with eight rebounds, seven assists, two steals and one 3-pointer in 32 minutes.
        
        
             His playmaking was the big takeaway as the point forward for the offense. If Andre Iguodala continues to start, there will be plenty of opportunity for Durant to handle the rock at least until Stephen Curry is able to return. Plus, the Warriors defense was as good as it's been in quite some time. The Spurs really don't have anyone to put on KD, so expect him to have a big series.

             The Spurs had more space issues than Apollo 13 in this game, and they couldn't get anything going in the paint. In the first three quarters, the Spurs had zero second-chance points and they only shot 5-of-21 in the paint. The Warriors kept throwing doubles at Aldridge and it didn't hurt Golden State because there isn't enough shooting around him. He struggled against them in the postseason last year and it could be a similar story this time around.

             Not great. He had a tough time against Kevin Durant and Anderson wasn't looking to get involved on offense. He also didn't start the second half with Rudy Gay taking over for him. After a strong season, Anderson's minutes could drop in Game 2.

             He did start the second half over Kyle Anderson because the Spurs were getting blown out. Gay is probably going to have to play more and the Spurs will likely work him into the game plan more. He'll be a DFS option in Game 2.

             He only did a little bit of practice on Saturday and wasn't able to practice on Friday. Brewer does plan to play in this game, and there's no talk of a setback. For now, it sounds like he's between questionable and probable for the home game.

Of course, that's a moot point with no more of those in the playoffs, and Wall did log 37.0 minutes per game in his last two active contests. He'll have a tough task against Kyle Lowry on both ends.

             He was called a game-time decision earlier today, but he gets the green light before the Wizards complete warmups. His calf strain from Tuesday was never considered serious, but the Wizards opted to hold him out on Wednesday. Porter will need a big series and he's likely going to have to guard DeMar DeRozan a bunch.

             It looked like coach Steve Kerr lost faith in McGee about a month ago, but now he'll be out there guarding LaMarcus Aldridge. Kevon Looney will likely back him up because David West hasn't played well. That said, the Warriors are really mixing it up here with Andre Iguodala starting at the point.

             Wow. This is a major surprise, especially after coach Steve Kerr has talked up Quinn Cook for about a month. Iguodala has been playing through a knee issue and perhaps this is a sign that he's feeling better than letting on. Iguodala usually gets a minutes bump in the postseason, so expect that to be the case here.

Porter has dealt with some leg injuries throughout his career, but this new issue doesn't sound serious. If he is limited, that will put even more pressure on Kelly Oubre.

            The Suns will interview David Fizdale for their coaching position, according to Scott Bordow of the Arizona Republic.
        
        
             The Suns look to be going for the top-notch guys and were also granted permission to speak with Hawks coach Mike Budenholzer. Fizdale was fired back in November and never really got a fair chance to pull his team out of a slow start. He'll likely get another chance as a head coach.

            Stephen Curry (knee) was examined by team doctors on Saturday and the Warriors announced that he has made ""steady functional progress"" and will ""intensify his on-court rehabilitation in the coming days.""
        
        
             Steph's increased rehab regime will include more running and lateral movement. He will be re-evaluated in one week. Curry is moving the right direction, but the Warriors will err on the side of caution with their two-time MVP. The best case scenario for Golden State would be making quick work of the Spurs, while the Blazers-Pelicans series went seven games, which would buy the maximum amount of rest for Steph before the start of the Round 2.

             D'Antoni told reporters that Anderson was able to do some on-court work in practice on Friday and that he will be dressed on Sunday, but that Rockets would be ""cautious."" Encouragingly, D'Antoni said he believed Anderson be ready ""soon after"" Game 1. Anderson has been sidelined since initially injuring his ankle back on April 3rd, which cost him the final four games of the regular season. Luc Mbah a Moute (shoulder) has already been ruled out of Game 1 and is expected to miss the entire first-round series, which means the Rockets will have limited depth up front on Sunday. Expect P.J. Tucker, Gerald Green and Joe Johnson to soak up additional minutes.

             Korver sat out the Cavs season finale on Wednesday and has been nursing a sore foot for the better part of a month. However, it appears he is ready to roll in Game 1. Korver was inconsistent and largely ineffective in the playoffs last year. The Cavs will need him to knock down open 3-pointers and stretch the floor this postseason.

             Both Lowry and DeMar DeRozan have echoed this sentiment over the past few days. Remarkably, the Raptors have lost Game 1 in each of their last ten playoff series, which is the longest such streak in NBA history. It's been 17 years since the Raps won a Game 1. Saturday's game will likely set the tone for the rest of this series. Toronto limited Kyle Lowry to just 32.2 minutes per game during the regular season, but expect Lowry to consistently log 35-plus minutes in the playoffs.

             ""I feel really good about going into next season with Kris Dunn as our starter and Cameron Payne as our backup,’’ Paxson said. ""All these young guys have a lot of things to work on and clean up, but Cameron showed a competitiveness to him, an ability to push the ball probably better than any guard we’ve had in a while, and he showed a defensive edge to him that will help us going forward.’’ The Bulls traded away valuable assets for Payne, so they'll give him one more year to prove himself. This is bad news for Jerian Grant.

             The Bulls are in a tricky spot with LaVine. He's just a year removed from ACL surgery and was working his way back into game shape. He flashed tremendous upside at times over the second half of the season, but was also woefully inefficient offensively, shooting just 38.3 percent from the floor. LaVine is reportedly looking for max, or at least near-max money. However, it would be very surprising if he received an offer approaching $100 million.

             He has been sore since his injury on Wednesday night. VanVleet is a tough customer and the expectation is that he'll play. Kyle Lowry's minutes may climb more in the playoffs, so VanVleet may only play around 20 minutes.

It's also somewhat surprising considering that Ball said he would play if asked, and that he could use plenty of reps to improve his shooting. Lonzo did say that he didn't plan on making any changes to his jumper during the offseason.

He told reporters on Wednesday that the swelling in his ankle was still a problem, but that he was confident he would be able to return to game action soon. With Luc Mbah a Moute (shoulder) expected to be sidelined for the first round, the Rockets would be thin at forward if Andeson were also ruled out. P.J. Tucker, Gerald Green and Joe Johnson would likely see an uptick in playing time in that scenario.

             Porter initially injured his calf in the first half of Tuesday's game vs. Boston. He didn't play in the second half and was ruled out of Wednesday's season finale. That fact that he was able to participate in portions of practice is encouraging, but the fact that he remains questionable is worrisome. We should expect an update on his status after Saturday's shootaround. The Wizards need him healthy if they hope to knock off the top-seeded Raptors.

Denver would obviously love to keep him, but if Barton is determined to secure a starting role, that will be an issue.

Amir Johnson, Ersan Ilyasova and Richaun Holmes will divvy up extra minutes if Embiid is unable to play.

             Luwawu-Cabarrot has been sidelined for over a month due to knee tendinitis. Even when healthy, he will not be a part of the Sixers postseason rotation due to the presence of Marco Belinelli and Markelle Fultz.

That’s the only thing that I’m about, I can play through the pain. But as long as it’s not bothering me, I’m OK."" The Heat did downplay Dragic's knee issue that kept him out Wednesday, and this isn't the first time he's played through an injury after his elbow problem before the break.

             Being open to something doesn't really mean much coming from a pro like Lopez. Reading between the lines here, Lopez could be looking to make a title run with a team like the Warriors -- they haven't announced a starting center for Game 1 yet. He'll be a name to watch and should have value in fantasy with 26-30 minutes per game.

             He got the night off on Wednesday, but did take a shot to his mouth earlier this week. Ibaka's minutes have come down because of the emergence of Pascal Siakam and Jakob Poeltl. It'll be interesting to see how coach Dwane Casey handles the minutes.

In the last 12 days of December, he was benched to play under 12 minutes in two games. However, he really picked it up in 2018. Randle is a bit of a mystery because the Lakers may have high hopes this summer.

He could be a game-time call, but for now it doesn't sound like there's much concern he'll miss time. If he is limited, Delon Wright should see a few extra minutes while Kyle Lowry could see a slight bump.

The Warriors will have a re-evaluation tomorrow, which could change things for the former two-time MVP. For now, it should be Quinn Cook as the starter on Saturday and likely for the whole first round.

             Knee soreness has been a culprit to keep Iguodala out of games for a good portion of 2018, and he's had numerous knee problems in his career. The Warriors are going to have to improve their defense to make a run while Stephen Curry is out, so Iguodala should see close to 30 minutes, assuming he's healthy.

             He did add he would like to stay with the Knicks long term. In their front office press conference today, the Knicks hinted that they'd like to take a more patient approach to building their roster. In other words, they may try to pull a carbon-copy version of what Sam Hinkie did, but of course there is only one master of trusting the process. If Kanter does opt out, the Knicks likely wouldn't be too aggressive, but you never really know with that team.

             ""From my seat he exceeded expectations,"" Paxson said. ""A foundational piece for everything we want to be. We’re lucky."" The Bulls front office added their favorite little saying as well in their exit interview. ""We're going to be young. We're going to be athletic,"" Paxson added. The Bulls will continue to use their guards to drive and kick the ball out, but Markkanen also showed he can create on his own. He'll be coming off the board in near pick 50 next year.

Harris wasn't in the rotation to start the year, but the injuries to Jeremy Lin and D'Angelo Russell got him some minutes. He had a mini-breakout year and he'll likely be looking at a multi-year, guaranteed deal.

As a restricted free agent, the Magic can match all offers on Gordon after a career year in basically every category for counting stats. He started off on fire to start the season, but wasn't able to keep it going. Plus, he really needs to increase his performance at the charity stripe to be an early-round guy.

Thanks to his 90.5 FT% this year, He lived up to the hype and beyond last season, so why not hype him up even more the first day of the offseason? Murray was an 88th percentile spot-up shooter this season and he was 87th percentile on off-screen plays, so making his jumper even better would put him in the upper echelon for shooters. He's just 21, so don't be surprised if he goes from a top-40 guy this year to a top-25 guy next season.

Dunn has his flaws offensively, but his first season in Chicago was a success. He averaged 13.6 points, 6.3 assists, 4.2 rebounds, 2.0 steals, 0.6 blocks, 1.1 triples and 2.5 turnovers in 43 starts, and if he improves his shot selection, his jumper and his ball security, Dunn will have a lot of intrigue as a mid-round pick.

He exercised his $12.5 million player option for 2018-19, but his path to fantasy value will be complicated because of D'Angelo Russell and Spencer Dinwiddie.

             Vogel had a lot of success as the head coach for the Pacers, but his time with the Magic wa a different story. The Magic had a  54-110 during his two seasons at the helm, so they will move on to their fifth coach since firing Stan Van Gundy in 2012. This job opening will certainly have a lot of appeal, as the Magic have some nice young pieces in Aaron Gordon and Jonathan Isaac to go with a likely top-5 pick in a strong draft.

            Donovan Mitchell couldn't get his shots to drop on Wednesday, going 6-of-23 from the field for 17 points, six boards, five assists, two steals and one 3-pointer.
        
        
             A victory would have made Utah the Northwest Division champs and handed them the No. 3 seed, but instead those honors went to the Blazers. This snaps a six-game win streak for the Jazz, but Mitchell has proven repeatedly that one bad game won't affect his confidence -- expect him to come out firing when Utah squares off vs. Oklahoma City in the first round of the playoffs.

            Dante Exum (left leg) was quiet in 20 minutes off the bench on Wednesday, scoring six points on 2-of-6 FGs and 2-of-2 FTs with three assists and one rebound.
        
        
             Exum left early on Tuesday due to soreness in his lower left leg, but the fact that Utah let him play in a back-to-back situation confirms it's nothing serious. He's given the Jazz a nice change-of-pace addition to the second unit but has yet to provide reliable value -- even as a DFS streamer, he's too risky to deploy with regularity.

             Turner has now recorded at least one steal in three straight games, which is the second time all season that's happened. His lack of statistical versatility precedes him, of course, so we're not reading into the recent upswing in defense. His role could also be dented with Moe Harkless (knee) potentially returning within the next week.

             He was mired in a slump recently, but he'll head into the postseason with some momentum after this stellar effort that helped the Blazers clinch the No. 3 seed in the West. Lillard did take a hard spill with a few minutes left in the fourth quarter, but he's one of the toughest guys in the league and should be ready for Game 1 vs. the Pelicans.

             The Blazers won't play Harkless until he is ""comfortable and confident"" in the health of his left knee, but he's still on his original three-week timetable. He was playing his best ball of the season prior to getting hurt, and Portland will get a nice boost if he does return in the first round vs. New Orleans.

             The Rockets were playing without Chris Paul, James Harden, Eric Gordon, Clint Capela, Ryan Anderson, Luc Mbah a Moute and Nene tonight. That gave Green all the touches he needed offensively, and he launched a whopping 17 three-pointers tonight -- the only other players with that many attempts this year are Allen Crabbe, Taurean Prince, Wayne Ellington and Harden. Considering this was the regular-season finale for Green, it was fun while it lasted.

             The veteran filled in with Houston resting most of their key players -- Johnson, P.J. Tucker and Gerald Green were joined by guys like Aaron Jackson, R.J. Hunter, Chinanu Onuaku and Zhou Qi. The 17-year veteran will head back to his usual reserve role but don't be surprised if he has a few big moments in the postseason.

""I'd like to [play Wednesday], but at the same time, we're going to have a few days to prepare [before the postseason]. I can get ready to go. It's not the end of the world if I don't get that last game."" With Luc Mbah a Moute (shoulder) expected to miss the first round of the playoffs, Anderson's status suddenly takes on increased importance for Houston.

             The Rockets signed Jackson to a rest-of-season deal earlier in the day, as they prepared to field a roster without Chris Paul, James Harden or Eric Gordon. It's a nice story for Jackson, a journeyman who has played in China and for CSKA Moscow, but this is probably the last you'll hear about him.

             The No. 15 pick in this year's draft finished with two consecutive scoreless games.

Even if the Kings don't add significant wing players this offseason, Jackson will only be a flier on draft day.

WCS made 9-of-12 shots and was 4-of-6 at the FT line, a strong finish to his third NBA campaign. He finished with late-round value in most situations -- he averaged career-highs with 12.6 points, 6.9 boards, 2.3 assists, 1.1 steals and 0.9 blocks, but fell to career-lows in percentages (49.8% FGs, 61.8% FTs).

             Those seven 3-pointers were a career high. Hart certainly showed he's capable of being a rotation player as a plus-rebounding guard who can handle the ball on the wing. Obviously the Lakers are going to have a much different roster in September, so it'll be tough to gauge what kind of role he has. If you started him in the last week of the fantasy playoffs, it paid off for you with four straight 20-point games.

             After his NBA debut on Tuesday gave him better per-game value in nine-cat leagues than Anthony Davis this season, Ingram didn't quite have it today. Maybe it was his 32-year-old legs in a back-to-back set, or it could have been because other guys got hot. Whatever the case, he'll probably earn a camp deal in September. Either way, it was a treat watching a math and physics teacher drop numbers in these last two.

If highlight plays per minute was a stat, Boban would have led the league. Free Boban now, and free Boban forever.

             This is the first time in NBA history a player has averaged a triple-double in consecutive campaigns, and we continue to witness greatness on a nightly basis. Asked before the game about criticism that he pads his stats, Westbrook replied, ""The people that’s talking ... they should try to do it and see how hard it is."" He's right, of course, and there's a reason it's never been done before. Turnovers and percentages continue to take a toll in 8-cat and 9-cat, but Westbrook is still a beast and he's truly elite in points-based formats.

             George was 7-of-7 from deep at one point vs. the Grizzlies' porous defense, and OKC went on to win a shootout 137-123 to wrap up the regular season. PG-13 has missed just three games and he's among the league leaders in steals (2.0 per game), in addition to 21.7 points, 3.0 triples, 5.7 rebounds, 3.3 assists and 0.5 blocks. The only real caveat has been 42.7% shooting on the season, but even so he's flirting with first-round value in almost any format.

             Sure, the Grizzlies rested a lot of guys, but credit for Rabb for having a nice finish. In his last five, he averaged 12.4 points, 8.6 boards, 1.8 assists, 0.8 steals and 1.2 blocks. He was worthwhile for anyone who picked him up over those games, but his role will be unclear for next season. The Grizzlies won't tank in October, right?

             The Bucks ran into a buzzsaw in Philly and the loss may have been particularly costly -- if they lose a coin flip for draft order on Friday, their  first-round pick will transfer to Phoenix. In any case, they have to be thrilled that Giannis is healthy for the postseason. ""We definitely know we can’t win the whole thing without [Antetokounmpo],"" Eric Bledsoe said recently. Their first task will be defeating the injury-depleted Celtics in the first round.

            Justin Anderson scored a season-high 25 points on Wednesday, hitting 9-of-17 shots with five 3-pointers, six rebounds, one assist, one steal and one block.
        
        
             Philly ran out to a 45-15 lead to begin the game and there was plenty of garbage time, but Anderson looked really good as part of an efficient second-unit attack. He played 32 minutes tonight and fell just shy of his career-high in scoring, taking advantage of Philly's decision to rest Robert Covington (17 minutes) and Ben Simmons (22 minutes) in a blowout.

            Markelle Fultz became the youngest player in NBA history to triple-double on Wednesday, scoring 13 points with 10 rebounds, 10 assists, two steals and one block.
        
        
             Fultz edges out Lonzo Ball as the youngest player with a trip-dub and he continues to impress off the bench for the surging Sixers. Despite near-constant fretting about Fultz's jumper and shoulder injury this season, he's looked great since returning to action on Mar. 26. He's helped the Sixers sustain their incredible 16-game win streak, despite the recent absence of Joel Embiid, and the future is now for this rebuilt squad. Trust the Process, indeed.

             Saric was dealing with a lacerated upper lip and chipped tooth, but fortunately he avoided anything more serious like a fracture or concussion. He's ready to roll for the playoffs, with the Sixers drawing the Heat as their first-round opponent.

             The 13-year streak of not making the playoffs is finally over as the Wolves were able to get in the playoffs in thrilling fashion. This game was the first time since 1997 that two teams were playing in a season finale that would put one team in the playoffs and send the other team home, and it's only the fifth time ever. As for Jimmy, his minutes were slightly dialed back in the first quarter, but that changed as the game went on. The Wolves could be dangerous in the playoffs, but they'll get the top-seeded Rockets.

             Three treys and some big-time boards aren't exactly typical Wiggins. Most importantly, Wiggins hit both of his free throws to put the Wolves up four points with 15 seconds left in overtime. Everyone piles on Wiggins and justifiably so, but now he'll finally be able to show what he can do in the postseason. Fantasy wise, he's hands-off material.

After the game, Gibson talked about how he played through his neck injury.  ""They gave me some good drugs,"" he said. This Taj signing worked out just fine.

             Besides not getting playing time in the second half, Vucevic wasn't affected by tanking too much. He only missed two games since returning from his wrist injury, so his fantasy owners should be fairly happy with the output late. Next year, he should still be with the Magic with the team almost a lock to take a point guard.

             John Wall was resting tonight, so as usual Satoransky got the fill-in start. He has completely overshadowed Tim Frazier (scoreless in 11 minutes) and could have low-end value even with Wall healthy next season -- if nothing else, he'll be a terrific handcuff in deeper leagues.

             Porter's timetable is uncertain and there's a chance Oubre will be forced to start to begin the postseason. We should have some clarity on Thursday, so check back if you're drafting a playoff-fantasy league. He played 27 minutes on Wednesday without a single rebound, steal or block, but is typically reliable with minutes in the 25-30 range.

Gordon said his coach has been ""great"" but there's widespread speculation that his job will be vacant this summer. Stay tuned.

             That's a wrap for AG's 2017-18 season. He opened the game 3-of-3 from deep but Orlando has no incentive to play their key starters, so they quickly sat Gordon and Nikola Vucevic in favor of Khem Birch and Marreese Speights. Gordon couldn't maintain his torrid early-season production and he struggled as the focal point of defenses when Vuc was injured, but he's still finishing with middle-round value despite poor percentages (43.3% FGs, 69.8% FTs). That'll be an area to watch throughout the offseason.

He finished as a top-40 player in nine-category leagues even after people were dropping him after his slow start. He has missed just one game in his career and he was awesome late in the season. He'll be coming off the board in the top 50 next year.

             He had some uncharacteristic misses, including not being as strong at the rim. Perhaps Harris wasn't healthy from his knee injury, and that could be why he didn't start. Harris still had a tremendous season despite a handful of injuries. He'll be a top-50 pick next year.

             That's a wrap for the new fantasy MVP from this season. AD said he will be going into a Westbrook-like mode since DeMarcus Cousins went down, and he wasn't kidding as the league's MVP if we're going off just February to April. For the second year in a row, Anthony ""Locker Room"" Davis played in 75 games despite a ridiculous amount of minor injuries. He finishes with 28.1 points, 11.1 boards, 2.3 assists, 1.5 steals and 2.6 blocks. He'll be going No. 1 in just about all drafts next year.

             Kornet had a few nice moments after Kristaps Porzingis went down, but he never showed the consistency needed for fantasy value -- suffice to say, he didn't score double-digit points in consecutive games all season. He'll go undrafted in fantasy leagues next season.

             Hicks went 2-of-2 from the line and he sank one 3-pointer, doing his damage off the bench. This was a meaningless regular-season finale, of course, but Hicks wound up taking minutes from starter Lance Thomas (two points in 11 minutes). We'll see if Hicks can make some noise during Summer League.

He's just 19 years old and has the tools to be a difference-maker in fantasy, but will need to bulk up and improve his percentages -- at 36.2% FGs and 72.1% FTs, he was a major drag for roto owners. That's what the offseason is for, right?

Shooting percentages were an issue and the Bulls still have Dunn and Jerian Grant under contract for next season, which reduces Payne to flier status in deep leagues.

             Rodney Hood (Achilles) is injured and the Cavs were resting Kyle Korver, which bumped Osman up in the rotation. This was the 30th different starting unit the Cavs have deployed, although a lot of that has to do with their massive shakeup at the trade deadline. Osman has proven to be a capable rotation player as needed, but he's unlikely to earn minutes in the playoffs.

            Abdel Nader made his first NBA start on Wednesday, putting up nine points on 4-of-15 shooting, eight rebounds, two assists, one steal and one block in 39 minutes.
        
        
             Nader got a glimmer of daylight in the rotation when Gordon Hayward went down in the season opener, but he's only had one quasi-reliable spurt in mid-March. The Celtics were resting Marcus Morris, Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum tonight, so this doesn't mean anything for Nader going forward.

             Al Horford, Terry Rozier, Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown and Marcus Morris were all rested tonight as a precaution, since Boston had nothing to play for in their regular-season finale. The result was Bird logging 29 minutes, while guys like Guerschon Yabusele (28 minutes), Abdel Nader (39 minutes) and Jonathan Gibson (25 minutes) also stepped up in the rotation.

             Larkin said that he lost 10 pounds while dealing with a flu recently, and he's still working to regain his strength and rhythm. He got a chance to shine with Terry Rozier resting tonight, and should be a big part of the lineup with Kyrie Irving (knee) done for the season and Marcus Smart (thumb) out until late in the month.

             Baynes took a career-high 15 shot attempts in the first half alone, and Brooklyn simply couldn't keep him off the glass tonight. He was an unlikely focal point for the Celtics' offense, but that's just because they were resting five players in a meaningless 82nd game. It's nice to know Baynes has this in him, but it doesn't impact his role for the postseason and beyond.

             There's no doubt the Raptors really wanted to win 60 games, but they'll be stuck on 59. Lowry's minutes took a major hit this season with his 32.1 per game, which is way down from 37.4 last year. It'll be interesting to see if he goes back up to the upper 30s against John Wall and the Wizards.

             The Nets used their 25th different starting lineup of the season tonight, and LeVert wound up with his first start since mid-December. It wasn't his best shooting night at 4-of-13 from the field, but he made both of his free throws and looked fine despite his recent injury. He'll be a popular target late in drafts, especially if don't bring back Joe Harris in free agency.

             The Nets improved their record by eight wins this season, which is the second-best mark behind Philly, and Allen's impressive play was a big reason for the modest success. He finishes with at least one block in 14 consecutive games, which is the third-longest streak by a Nets rookie since 1983-84, trailing only P.J. Brown and Brook Lopez. With the ability to rack up big-man stats without hurting your percentages, Allen has the makings of a tremendous roto center.

             He passed Kirk Hinrich's previous record, and thanks in part to Markkanen's efforts beyond the arc Chicago also made a franchise-high in 3-pointers this season. With his natural touch and high release, he's going to be a nightmare for opposing big men for years to come. After posting top-75 value as a rookie, he's likely to go in the 40-50 range in his sophomore season.

No matter who is coaching Detroit next year, it'll be hard for Ellenson to hold fantasy value while Andre Drummond and Blake Griffin are around.

            Fred VanVleet (right shoulder bruise) will not return on Wednesday.
        
        
             He suffered the injury in the fourth quarter and was in a lot of pain on the floor. It's Delon Wright stepping up for VanVleet and that would continue into the postseason. There could also be a little more Norman Powell, but that may not be the case in the postseason.

            Eric Moreland racked up multiple career-highs on Wednesday with 16 points, 17 rebounds, four assists, four steals and four blocks in 41 minutes of action.
        
        
             Moreland was filling in for Andre Drummond (Achilles) in the Pistons' final game of the season, and he took full advantage of the extra run, resulting in his second career double-double. The rebounds and defensive stats probably won some matchups for owners who streamed him, and it's a terrific way to end his season. Assuming the Pistons guarantee his $1.8 million salary, though, it'll be hard to find daylight in the frontcourt.

             Kennard closes the season on a tear over the past three games, averaging 20.3 points on 53.9% shooting, 5.0 rebounds, 3.8 assists and 1.3 steals. The supporting stats are crucial and would give Kennard another dimension as a fantasy asset, although he's done little to make us think the recent surge is sustainable. We'll keep a close eye on his progress throughout the offseason.

             LBJ only played to keep his streak intact, and he also played in 82 regular-season games for the first time in his career -- a welcome surprise for anyone who drafted James. He'll also finish with the most total points scored in the NBA this season (2,251), and has been a top-three roto asset throughout the regular season. Now we get to witness more playoff-mode LeBron.

             It's a late scratch for Redick in the season finale. He's had back problems before, so maybe something happened in warmups. The 76ers still have depth behind him, so Belinelli, Ersan Ilyasova, Markelle Fultz and T.J. McConnell will get extra run.

            Gary Harris (knee) will not have a minutes limit for Wednesday's regular-season finale against the Timberwolves.
        
        
             Head coach Mike Malone wouldn't say if Harris would start, but he did say: ""Like Apollo Creed said, 'there's no tomorrow.' If I have to play Gary Harris 30 min tonight, I'll play Gary Harris 30 min."" He only played 18 minutes on Monday, but he looked good, so at the very least he should be able to flirt with minutes in the mid-20s. That'll take away some from Will Barton's fantasy appeal.

            Sean Kilpatrick will replace Justin Holiday in the starting lineup for Wednesday's regular-season finale against the Pistons.
        
        
             The Bulls will go with a starting five featuring Cameron Payne, Kilpatrick, David Nwaba, Lauri Markkanen and Cristiano Felicio for their final game of the season, and Kilpatrick is on the radar as a potential streamer with how well he's been playing as of late. Holiday will not take the floor in this one, and neither will Robin Lopez.

             That should mean he is also getting the night off, which is not a big surprise after he already won't be hitting 82 games. Jabari Bird and Abdel Nader should have big opportunities with Semi Ojeleye backing them up.

             Yeah, this is a little different than what the Celtics had back in October. Yabusele was questionable to play today after a weekend knee injury, so he could be limited. Greg Monroe should still see minutes in the 20s with a big upside.

With him out, that should get Alex Caruso and Tyler Ennis minutes at the point.

Booker has a chance to make $156 million this summer, and it would be a major shock to see him not take that extension. This quote sounds like it's more about Booker going all out this summer to set him up for a huge 2018-19. The Suns are going to be a big story this summer.

             Over the weekend, coach Doc Rivers said that Williams was playing through an ankle injury, so he won't be playing in the final two games now. He has Sixth Man of the Year locked up and turned out to be one of the best assets in fantasy this season. With him out, Tyrone Wallace should get some heavy run, but C.J.

            Guerschon Yabusele (knee) is questionable to play Wednesday against the Nets.
        
        
             Yabusele said on Tuesday that he wasn't planning to play today, so we'd consider him much closer to doubtful for Wednesday's meaningless game. Semi Ojeleye and Jabari Bird will have the opportunity for some extended minutes tonight with Yabusele likely to join Al Horford (rest) on the sidelines.

             Guerschon Yabusele is also questionable with knee soreness, so Greg Monroe could be looking at quality minutes tonight, putting him on the radar in DFS with a favorable matchup against Brooklyn. Marcus Morris should also have more minutes and shots falling his way with both Horford and Terry Rozier (rest) unavailable.

             This is the least surprising move ever with the Celtics on the second leg of a back-to-back set against one of the worst teams out East. Shane Larkin figures to draw the start tonight with Kadeem Allen backing him up, and there will be more minutes available for Greg Monroe. Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown will be very busy on the offensive end in this one.

Anderson has suddenly become more important in Houston with Luc Mbah a Moute (shoulder) expected to miss Round-1, but if he does get out there tonight, it'll likely be for limited minutes.

Griffin was okay through 25 games iwth the Pistons, churning out averages of 19.8 points, 6.6 boards, 6.2 dimes and 1.9 triples per contest on 43.3% shooting, but adding some shooting to Detroit's backcourt this summer could really help improve Griffin's shooting percentage.

Gibson's ability to play will likely be a matter of pain tolerance, but he's pretty legendary in that department; he played through torn ligaments in his ankle during his Chicago days.

            Spencer Dinwiddie (sore right knee) has been ruled out for Wednesday's regular-season finale against the Celtics.
        
        
             He'll join DeMarre Carroll (hip) and Joe Harris (ankle) on the sidelines tonight, which should result in more minutes for guys like Caris LeVert and Nik Stauskas, and LeVert might end up starting tonight. Stauskas might be someone to think about as a low-end, 3-point streamer, but it's LeVert who you'd want to go after as a DFS punt play.

            Luc Mbah a Moute (shoulder) is expected to miss the first-round of the playoffs and he is currently without an official timetable to return.
        
        
             Apparently the MRI results were not great, and this is a tough blow for Houston as they lose one of their glue guys on the eve of the postseason. ""He is a big part of what we are trying to do and what we have been doing,"" said James Harden after Tuesday's game. ""Same injury, same shoulder twice, but he's a soldier. He is going to bounce back stronger than ever."" Mbah a Moute missed 15 games in mid-December with this injury, so he could be looking at a lengthy absence here. P.J. Tucker, Gerald Green and Trevor Ariza will pick up the slack in his absence.

Considering he only missed two games, he should see a full complement of minutes tonight, and his return to action will likely push Jabari Parker back to the second unit.

Kanter is coming off one of his best seasons, finishing the year with averages of 14.1 points, 11.0 rebounds and 1.5 assists per game on 59.2% shooting from the field and 84.8% from the stripe, so it'll be very interesting to see if he picks up his player option worth $18.6 million this summer or decides to test his value on the open market.

             His wife and kids were on hand, he made some huge shots and looked like he belonged, and the whole story was nothing short of miraculous and inspirational, even though we may never hear from him again. It's too bad more teams don't give minor-league journeymen opportunities like this, as it was a blast to watch, as opposed to some of the other silly-season stuff we've been subjected to over the last month. Congratulations on your big night, Andre. It was awesome. And props to Magic Johnson and the Lakers for making it happen. He's probably not done done yet, as the Lakers play the Clippers in Wednesday's meaningless finale, but it's hard to imagine him playing that well again on Wednesday night.

            Kevin Durant took a hard fall in the first half of Tuesday's ugly 119-79 loss to the Jazz and was holding his hip, but still played some in the second half, despite this game being over at halftime.
        
        
             Durant hit 5-of-12 shots for 13 points, four rebounds and one assist on a night the Warriors were outscored 33-16 in the first quarter, 29-17 in the second, and 31-23 in the third. It's a little weird, as Durant, Draymond Green, Klay Thompson and Quinn Cook were all out there to start the game, but they were simply steamrolled by the Jazz. The Warriors' regular season is now over and everyone will get some rest before the playoffs start. This game was meaningless to the Warriors, as they were already locked into the No. 2 seed in the West and will likely face the Thunder, and will now focus on getting everyone some rest and welcoming Stephen Curry back, hopefully in Round 2.

            Dante Exum left Tuesday's game vs. the Warriors with some soreness in his lower left leg and didn't return.
        
        
             The Jazz had a comfortable lead all night, so hopefully this was just a precaution. Exum finished with six points, two assists, one rebound and one steal in 19 minutes. He's been sneaky good since his return from his shoulder injury and should be a big part of the second unit in the playoffs.

             He had 21 points alone in the first quarter, joining Paul Pierce as the only Celtics to score 20 points in the first quarter in the last 20 seasons. Brown shot 8-of-18 from the field, 6-of-10 from beyond the arc and 5-of-6 from the line, adding two assists, one rebound and two steals in 32 minutes. He's taken his game to another level in April and recently dropped a career-high 32 points vs. the Bulls.

He also had seven turnovers, but the rest of it is one of his best lines of the season.
        
        
             Wall sat out on Friday to rest and was ready to roll tonight for the Wizards, who are currently the No. 8 seed and sitting with an identical record as the No. 7 Miami Heat. Both teams play on Wednesday and it should be interesting to see who finishes at No. 8 and plays the No. 1 Raptors, and who finishes at No. 7 and faces the banged up and struggling Boston Celtics. It's also going to be tough for the Wizards to lose to the Magic tomorrow, even if they wanted to, while the Heat get the Raptors. As for Wall, he missed most of February and March after knee surgery and has only played in four games since returning, so this was nice to see.

             If you watched this game simply because you like basketball, you REALLY like basketball. But if you happened to stumble upon Peters' performance tonight, it was pretty remarkable. His previous career high was eight points, he was drafted with the 54th pick last year out of Valpo, is on a two-way contract, and has played in a total of 18 NBA games. The Suns accidentally won the game, but it's OK because they tanked well enough to still be assured of the worst record in the NBA this season, and it was fun getting to watch Peters go all-world. Shaq Harrison, Alex Len, Danuel House and Dragan Bender all played well for the Suns tonight, whose season is mercifully over with a record of 21-61. And if you somehow used Peters in DFS tonight, go buy some lottery tickets while you're at it.

             You'll hear some chatter about Donovan Mitchell possibly winning the Rookie of the Year Award, but given that the Sixers have won 15 straight games, are sitting as the No. 3 seed, and how Simmons, outside of tonight (probably because he was sick), has been pretty dominant in the absence of Joel Embiid, it's hard to imagine him not winning it. The Sixers have one more game left and Simmons should be out there again on Wednesday night against the Bucks. The Sixers have become must-see TV and Simmons is a big reason why.

             Atlanta didn't do a very good job of tanking by winning three of their previous five games coming into this one, along with two straight, but were handled by the Sixers and finished with a 24-58 record, which is currently the worst in the East. A Magic loss to the Wizards on Wednesday, which should be a no-brainer, will leave the two teams tied for the worst record in the East, while the Grizzlies and Suns will finish with a worse record than Atlanta. Prince and John Collins, along with Dennis Schroder, have serious fantasy star potential and the young Hawks should be ready to roll for a whole season next year. And regardless of how many ping pong balls the Hawks get on draft lottery night, they're almost assured a very good pick in the draft.

Porter finished with 12 points, five rebounds, two assists, one steal and two triples.

            Malik Monk scored 17 points with two assists and three triples in 25 minutes in the season finale on Tuesday.
        
        
             Where would the Hornets be if they gave Monk these minutes instead of Michael Carter-Williams? Coach Steve Clifford was very critical of Monk's defense all season, but he made some serious noise down the stretch with averages of 19.3 points, 3.8 assists and 3.6 triples over his last six games. The Hornets could look pretty similar in 2018-19 because of their bloated payroll, but we'd expect Monk to take on a much bigger role.

             The Pacers rested three out of five starters, while the Hornets went with their normal rotation in the season finale. Kaminsky hit 10-of-17 shots and 3-of-8 triples, adding seven rebounds, one assist and one block in 27 minutes. He was basically in a timeshare with Marvin Williams all season which limited his upside, and with Williams on the books for another two seasons, Kaminsky will have his work cut out for him to become a reliable fantasy asset.

             Victor Oladipo (foot), Bojan Bogdanovic (rest) and Thaddeus Young (rest) all sat out, but Indiana limited the minutes of Turner and Darren Collison by design since the No. 5 seed has been locked up. Regardless, this was a huge letdown for Turner and he'll head into the postseason in the midst of a brutal slump -- he's averaging 4.2 points, 2.6 rebounds and 1.0 blocks on 27.3% shooting over his last five games.

He does have some sleeper potential for next season.

             He's obviously going to miss the season finale, but he's expected to make a full recovery in time for the team's summer program. This is not the same foot as his last injury, and it's also not as severe. Mason averaged 7.9 points, 2.8 assists, 2.5 rebounds, 0.7 steals, 0.6 triples and 1.3 turnovers in 18.9 minutes this season, shooting 37.9% from the field and 81.7% from the line.

            Dirk Nowitzki said that he is planning on returning for the 2018-19 season.
        
        
             Dirk was surprisingly durable for the majority of the 2017-18 campaign, starting 77 of the Mavs first 78 games, before suffering an ankle injury, which required surgery. Interestingly, Dirk did not rule out playing beyond next season. ""Hopefully I can play some decent basketball next season. If not, it’s time to go,"" he said.

             Of course he's not playing. The Suns will enter Tuesday's games with just eight healthy bodies, meaning there will be big minutes for guys like Tyler Ulis, Danuel House, Dragan Bender and Alex Len. Ulis will help you with dimes, House with points and triples, Bender can give you some treys, points, boards and blocks and Len should be good for a double-double.

             Simmons skipped shootaround due to the illness, but it sounds like he'll give it a go tonight, although he could hit the sidelines early if the game turns into a blowout. Check back for official confirmation on his status closer to tip-off.

Nik Stauskas should also see some more minutes with the second unit, but Dinwiddie is the preferable target here.

             To be clear, he will not play tonight, but he is in the final stages of the concussion protocol testing and he'll be re-evaluated after Tuesday's game. Perhaps he'll be able to make it back to the court for Wednesday's regular-season finale, but we likely won't get another update until we're much closer to Wednesday's tip.

Phoenix will again be extremely shorthanded on Tuesday, with Devin Booker (hand), Elfrid Payton (knee), Josh Jackson (quad) and Alan Williams (knee) already ruled out. We should get a final confirmation on Chriss' status approximately 90 minutes prior to tip-off.

             Hood sat out Monday's game in New York. The Cavs primary focus is making sure Hood is as healthy as possible for the start of the postseason this weekend. If Hood is unable to play in the regular season finale, J.R. Smith and Kyle Korver would soak up some extra playing time.

He has a $5.5 million team option for the 2018-19 campaign. If the Suns decline it, he will become an unrestricted free agent.

             Hardaway is still recovering from an ankle sprain he suffered last Friday. With the season finale being essentially meaningless, the Knicks don't have any incentive to rush him back unless he is 100 percent. Assuming THJ sits out Wednesday, Frank Ntilikina, Courtney Lee and Damyean Dotson will continue to log additional minutes.

The Sixers have won 14-straight, with Simmons averaging a triple-double during the 14-game stretch. And this game does matter to Philly in terms of playoff positioning, as the Sixers need to win their final two contests to lock up the No. 3 seed in the East. We should have an update on Simmons this afternoon. If he is unable to play, Markelle Fultz and T.J. McConnell will divvy up minutes at point guard.

             If Williams is unable to play Tuesday night, he will have finished the season appearing in a total of just five contests due to offseason knee surgery. The Suns have a $5.5 million team option on Williams for the 2018-19 season. It will be interesting to see if they decide to pick up that option, or decline it and make Williams an unrestricted free agent this summer

Chriss had been playing well prior to sitting out Sunday's loss to the Warriors. Over his past five games, Chriss averaged 15.0 points, 10.8 rebounds, 1.4 steals and 1.2 blocks.

             Davis was great, as usual, but ran to the locker room in the third quarter, later returned, and then took a couple shots to the face before finally exiting with the game in control in the fourth quarter. The Pels are in, but playoff seeding is still not set in the West. Davis has been a beast all season, but we can add another trip to the locker room to his resume and we're guessing he's the career leader in that category. We don't know if AD will play on Wednesday, as the Pelicans simply have to have him healthy for the playoffs, but at least he got out of tonight's game in one piece. They play the Spurs on Wednesday, who will likely be resting the starters, and the Pelicans still have a shot at the No. 4 seed, so chances are he'll be out there on Wednesday.

             Davis missed his last four games with an ankle injury, but was able to get back out there tonight, although he didn't do much of anything. The Blazers may give him some meaningful minutes in Wednesday's finale in order to get him in game shape for the postseason, but we wouldn't plan on trusting him in that one.

            Nikola Jokic triple-doubled for the 10th time this season in Monday's huge 88-82 win over the Blazers, scoring 15 points with 20 rebounds, 11 assists, two steals, one block and one triple.
        
        
             He pulled down some key rebounds late and had a sick dime to a cutting Jamal Murray in the final two minutes. Jokic finished 5-of-14 from the field and hit all four free throws, finishing with a +18 rating. That's Denver's sixth straight win and they could claim their first playoff berth since 2013 with a win over the Wolves on Wednesday -- both teams are currently tied for the No. 8 seed.

            Jusuf Nurkic hit 9-of-15 shots for 20 points, 19 rebounds and a steal in 30 minutes of Monday's 88-82 loss to the Nuggets.
        
        
             This was basically a must-win game for the Nuggets, while the Blazers were locked into the playoffs either way. Nurkic held his own against Nikola Jokic, who had another monster game for the Nuggets, and the Blazers are pretty healthy as the playoffs approach. The Blazers finish up with the Jazz on Wednesday, which should actually have some playoff implications with the No. 3, 4, 5 and 6 seeds still all bunched up. Hopefully that means that Nurkic, Damian Lillard and C.J. McCollum will all be out there going full speed again in the finale.

             The Spurs and Thunder had a tough road to the playoffs, but both teams got it done and secured a spot in the postseason with tonight's wins. The Spurs play the Pelicans in Wednesday's finale, but it's anyone's guess who Gregg Popovich throws out there. The Spurs were just trying to get in and avoid a lost season after suffering through a nine-game season from Kawhi Leonard. Mission accomplished.

             Gay, Manu Ginobili and Bryn Forbes combined for 25 points in the fourth quarter, which is when the Spurs put the Kings away and secured a spot in the postseason for the 21st consecutive time. The Spurs playoff streak is the longest active one in the four major sports, followed by the Pittsburgh Penguins, who are second with 12 straight playoff appearances. The Spurs now have a somewhat meaningless game on Wednesday against the Pelicans, and it's going to be hard to trust any of them as they prepare for the playoffs.

             Yuck. Hopefully you weren't counting on these two tonight, but it wasn't easy to see coming. Jackson had played very well in his previous two games, and Bogdanovic was hot before fading over his last two. They'll have a chance for redemption on Wednesday against the Rockets, but they're going to be hard to trust after tonight's disasters.

             The game was a little too close for comfort for most of the night, but the Wolves pulled away late with a 30-19 fourth quarter.

             He didn't do anything else, but it's nice to know he can still score. There are other players with more upside you can deploy for Wednesday's finale, as it's hard to see Muhammad doing this in two straight games.

             Taj Gibson was ruled out with neck soreness in the first quarter, and Dieng probably would've played more if not for foul trouble. If Gibson is unable to play on Wednesday vs. the Nuggets, that means we'll likely see more of both Dieng and Nemanja Bjelica -- Bjelica started the second half and had two points, five rebounds, two assists and two blocks in 20 minutes. Dieng will have mid-round upside with starter's minutes, so keep an eye on the injury report.

             Maybe he was trying to make a statement to Malcolm Brogdon, who was back from his quad injury tonight, or maybe he just felt like ballin' out with Giannis Antetokounmpo in street clothes. Either way, Bledsoe's had a fine season for the Bucks and this was his first triple-double of the year, and just his third double-double, as well. He's feeling it right now, hitting double digits in assists in his last two games and averaging 21.8 points, 4.8 rebounds, 7.4 assists, 1.8 steals and 2.2 3-pointers over his last five.

            Ben McLemore scored a team-high 18 points with seven rebounds and one assist in Monday's loss to the Wolves.
        
        
             He was a -26 in his 42 minutes. The Grizzlies clinched the second worst record in the NBA tonight, so maybe they won't rest as many players on Wednesday. McLemore has had a few random scoring outbursts this season and has four games with 13+ points out of his last five, but for the most part, this has been another forgetful campaign for the 25-year-old wing.

             Vuc has been playing well and while there was a chance he could have rested tonight, he was out there powering through it and playing well. We'll have to see if plays in Wednesday's finale against the Wizards, but if he's starting in that one, you'll want him in your fantasy lineup. Aaron Gordon, Mario Hezonja, Khem Birch and Bismack Biyombo all played decently for the Magic, but Vuc was the star in a meaningless game.

             He had to come back down to earth at some point, as Brooks was averaging 23.6 points, 3.6 assists, 3.4 rebounds, 1.4 steals and 3.2 triples while shooting an unsustainable 57.9% from the field in his previous five outings. He also turned the ball over five times tonight, but did hand out five assists with one board, two steals and two triples.  Brooks will look to finish his season on a high note in Wednesday's season finale vs. OKC.

             He played a team-high 40 minutes, adding six rebounds, five assists, one steal, one block and one triple. The Knicks were outscored by 17 points when Ntilikina was off the floor and this will go down as one of his best all-around games of the season. Coach Jeff Hornacek said Ntilikina has put on eight pounds since the season started and we're already starting to see dividends. ""That’s great in his development,"" Hornacek said. ""He’s only going to get bigger and stronger. Our trainers are working with him hard every day to improve on those things.’’

             George's line wasn't incredible tonight, but he played very well, especially in the fourth quarter when the Thunder outscored the Heat 39-12, and he's a big reason they're going to be playing in the postseason. George has one game remaining, which is Wednesday night against the Grizzlies. Carmelo Anthony, on the other hand, had 11 points on 4-of-11 shooting, as his season of disappointment continues.

             It wasn't an easy road to the playoffs and this game was close until the Thunder went on a late tear in the fourth quarter, outscoring the Heat 39-12. Westbrook's monster line gets him back in the hunt to average a triple-double on the season, and he'll be going all in on Wednesday against the Grizzlies, which is their season finale. This was his 25th triple-double of the season and if our calculations are right, Westbrook is now averaging 25.6 points, 9.92 rebounds and 10.1 assists with one game remaining. And that means it would take 16 rebounds on Wednesday to finish with the triple-double average. His teammates were blocking out for him to board tonight and he's had at least 15 rebounds in three of his last four games. Something tells us he's going to get at least 16 boards on Wednesday.

             He also made an interesting business decision by dodging a LeBron James slam (link below). Beasley has been playing his way into a nice payday and this was his 21st game of the season with 20+ points. The Knicks are now tied with the Nets for eighth place in the lottery standings with one game remaining, so there's no guarantee that they will let him play in the season finale.

             The Thunder pulled away late in this one and it was a much closer game than the final score suggests. Whiteside has righted the ship, averaging 13.2 points, 9.0 rebounds and 2.2 blocks over his last five, as the Heat now sit as the No. 7 seed in the East. And that might be the preferable spot, as a date with the banged up Celtics may not be a bad thing. James Johnson, Josh Richardson, Tyler Johnson and Justise Winslow all played well for the Heat in the loss.

He also hit 9-of-9 free throws in the best game of his life.
        
        
             ""I shook his hand after the game and it was still hot,"" said coach Kenny Atkinson. The Nets are at Boston for Wednesday's finale and chances are Crabbe will be out there again with Joe Harris (ankle) and Caris LeVert (foot) hurting. Crabbe has been sensational over his last three games after returning from the flu, scoring 41, 20 and 25 points in those games and burying a total of 18 3-pointers. His eight triples tied his career high, which he's done several times.

             This was Russell's first April double-double and he'll look to keep it going on Wednesday at Boston, assuming the Nets play all their studs in the finale. It's likely that they will.

             He's been a bit disappointing off the bench, but was back in form and the starting lineup tonight.

             Allen's been a bit disappointing this season, but is averaging a ridiculous 3.6 blocks over his last five games, swatting at least four shots in three straight games. He's also averaging just 8.2 points over his last five, but all signs are pointing to him breaking out next season. The hype machine will be rolling, as there's a lot to love about Allen's game and potential.

             Kilpatrick's been playing well for a couple weeks now, had a couple nice games against his former team (the Nets), and is averaging 19 points, 3.2 rebounds, 0.8 steals, 0.6 blocks and 2.8 3-pointers over his last five. He looks like a solid option in Wednesday's meaningless season finale against the Pistons, despite playing for four different NBA teams this season.

             He was grabbing his right shoulder and was being looked at by the team trainer, but they'll re-evaluate him in the locker room. If Gibson is unable to return, that means we'll see more of Gorgui Dieng and Nemanja Bjelica.

            Adrian Wojnarowski is reporting that the Cavaliers will sign 13-year veteran Kendrick Perkins to fill their final playoff roster spot.
        
        
             The Cavs released him in the preseason and we last saw him in the NBA in 2016. He spent time with the G League's Canton Charge this season, averaging 8.7 points and 7.1 rebounds before ""retiring"" from the G League. It was unknown at that time whether or not he was retiring entirely from basketball or if he was only retiring from the G League, and now we have our answer. If you're playing in a playoff fantasy league or some trying some postseason DFS action, Perkins is probably a guy you should avoid at all costs.

Jabari Parker will draw another start and Eric Bledsoe and Khris Middleton will have more on their plate offensively.

             Rodney Hood (Achilles) is out so Korver will get the start, although he'll be on a minutes limit, so he's not the most attractive streaming option out there. J.R. Smith should also pick up some extra minutes tonight sans Hood.

             He was originally listed as probable, so hopefully, he didn't experience a setback during warmups. Hood was also held to just 12 minutes on Friday, so maybe they're just being extremely cautious here with the playoffs on the horizon. J.R. Smith and Kyle Korver should pick up some extra minutes in Hood's absence.

             The Lakers have two games left and it's a back-to-back set, so the goal might be for Ball to play in one of them. All we have to work with is a questionable tag and it's not clear if Ball was able to practice on Monday. If he continues to sit, Tyler Ennis and Alex Caruso will continue to soak up the PG minutes.

Reggie Jackson will be very busy on offense in this one.

            Marcus Smart (thumb) was re-evaluated on Monday and he's expected to be cleared to return to the court by April 27.
        
        
             April 27 will be the six-week mark for Smart, so it sounds like he'll get back to the court at the early end of that initial 6-8 week timetable. If the Celtics go seven games in their first-round series, Smart could potentially return for Game 7. He's been cleared for non-contact work, and we'll continue to track his progress every step of the way.

             The Nuggets need to keep winning to keep their playoff hopes alive, and it sounds like they'll be getting Harris back to join in on the chase for the No. 8 spot tonight. He's missed the past 11 games and will likely have a minutes cap, but even with minutes in the mid-20s he's capable of offering value in fantasy hoops. He's not a great DFS play, but he should be picked up in leagues that go to the bitter end. Will Barton will likely head back to the bench if Harris plays.

             Fantasy owners could see this coming from a mile away after Gasol played 35 minutes on Sunday night with 20 points with nine rebounds, nine assists, one steal, one block and three triples. With JaMychal Green (knee soreness) and Jarell Martin (ankle) both out, that means we're going to see a lot of Ivan Rabb and Deyonta Davis.

We'd expect him to play on Wednesday vs. the 76ers as well, as the Bucks need to get his conditioning back up. He'll surely have restrictions, so DFS owners will probably want to go in another direction. Tony Snell, Jason Terry and Brandon Jennings could all lose minutes with Brogdon back.

Frank Ntilikina will also play all the minutes he can handle and Trey Burke will pick up some of the slack on offense.

             A restricted free agent this summer, there's a good chance that Payton has played his last game as a Sun. He did register a pair of triple-doubles with averages of 11.8 points, 5.3 rebounds, 6.2 assists, 1.0 steals and 2.8 triples, but his defense was exposed and he still has a lot of work to do on his shooting. Landing a starting job this summer may prove to be difficult.

             The Suns haven't been transparent with all their injuries and we've had little to no updates on Warren's knee since he went down on March 17. This was Warren's best season by a mile, finishing with averages of 19.6 points, 5.1 rebounds, 1.3 assists, 1.0 steals and 0.3 triples on 49.8% shooting from the field and 75.7% from the line. His ability to play multiple positions means his role should be safe next season regardless of who the Suns take in the draft.

             The Suns have clinched the worst record in the NBA and the best draft lottery odds, but they will continue to be cautious in the season finale. T.J. Warren (knee) and Elfrid Payton (knee) are also out, while there's a good chance that Troy Daniels (ankle) sits as well. Danuel House has made a strong case for a roster spot in 2018-19 and will get plenty of minutes to showcase himself on Tuesday after his 22-point performance vs. the Warriors.

It’s nice when you get lucky, and that was good for us."" He’s averaging 10.9 points on 64.4 percent shooting in just 16.7 minutes per game and has been one of the most efficient big men in the NBA. If DeAndre Jordan leaves this summer, Harrell's value could really take off.

             Looney did not start, but he outplayed Zaza Pachulia, especially at the defensive end. The Warriors will wrap up their regular season in Utah on Tuesday. While the Golden State center position has been a fantasy wasteland, Looney is probably the best of the lot right now.

            Quinn Cook posted 14 points over 37 minutes in Sunday's 117-100 victory in Phoenix.
        
        
             Cook has done a decent job filling in for the injured Steph Curry and the club rewarded him with a multi-year contract over the weekend. He responded by going 6-of-13 from the floor, including 2-of-5 from behind the 3-point line, while adding six rebounds, three assists and just one turnover. He isn't jacking up as many shots with Kevin Durant and Klay Thompson back in the fold, but he isn't doing too shabby keeping the point guard seat warm, either.

             Fantasy owners might be a little disappointed, actually, as Thompson dropped 22 points in the first quarter and it looked like a monster night was underway. It was his first 20-point quarter of the season, and eight of his career. He was 9-of-11 in the first 12 minutes, and ended up 14-of-23, including 6-of-13 from long range. The Dubs wrap up their regular season on Tuesday in Salt Lake City before their real season begins.

             Ennis was sharp, hitting 9-of-18 from the floor while hitting 1-of-3 from behind the 3-point line and 3-of-3 from the free-throw stripe. He also added six rebounds, two assists and three steals with just one turnover. He has taken advantage of the fact Lonzo Ball (knee) and Brandon Ingram (concussion) have been sidelined, finishing up strong and building good tape for evaluation heading into next season.

             The big man is usually pretty effective, so it's uncertain if his back was bugging him. He has been battling a back issue for a little while, but most players are battling dings and bruises by this juncture of the season. He was able to chip in with five rebounds and three assists, but this one won't go in his career highlights video, that's for sure.

             Rubio was a game-time decision after battling lingering soreness in his hamstring for a while, and he played with a minutes cap in this one. When he was on the court he was very good, hitting 4-of-6 from the field with three rebounds, two assist and two steals with just one turnover and a solid plus-16 rating, second-best on the team. Royce O'Neale and Dante Exum carried a heavier load with Rubio's workload limited, but the veteran Rubio appears to be a go for the postseason.

It appears that he did not have any vision issues, and if he did early on he was able to work through them. He looks good to go for the postseason.

             The 12 boards were a career-high and this was his third double-double of the campaign. Birch saw some time at the four tonight because Nikola Vucevic and Bismack Biyombo were both active, and he's been a nice surprise for the Magic this season and has arguably outplayed Biyombo. If Vucevic or Biyombo sits on Monday vs. the Bucks, Birch would have a good bit of streaming appeal on a nine-game slate.

If Vucevic does sit, that would open things up for both Bismack Biyombo and Khem Birch.

Gordon and Nikola Vucevic were surprise scratches in their last game, and with Orlando doing their best to slide in the standings, they may sit one or both of these guys on Monday vs. the Bucks on the second night of a back-to-back.

             There was some obvious rust and he played just 10 minutes, but that's to be expected since this was his first action since Nov. 9. We wouldn't be surprised if Ross was held out of Monday's game vs. the Bucks on the second night of a back-to-back, but if he does play he'll be very limited once again.

             Ingles was a very efficient 9-of-12 from the floor, including 3-of-6 from behind the 3-point line, while dishing out 10 assists with four rebounds, a steal and a blocked shot. Earlier in the weekend he became just the second international player to hit 200 or more 3-pointers in a season. He has emerged as one of the best shooters in the NBA, and it will be interesting to see him making noise in the playoffs for an under-the-radar Jazz team.

             Mitchell hit 9-of-18 from the field, including 3-of-7 from behind the 3-point line, while going 7-of-10 from the free-throw stripe. With the victory the Jazz were able to officially punch their ticket to the playoffs in the Western Conference, and their opponent will be determined this week. They're now within a game of the Trail Blazers for the third spot in the Western Conference, too.

             The Raptors rested DeMar DeRozan tonight, so it's not a surprise to see Wright post a solid line -- the last time DeRozan missed a game, Wright had 10 points, five rebounds, four assists, one steal and one block in 28 minutes. It's possible the Raptors rest more veterans on Monday and Kyle Lowry would be an obvious candidate, so Wright could be in line for another nice game.

            Updating a previous report, Josh Jackson (quad, tanking) will not play on Sunday vs. the Warriors.
        
        
             Over an hour ago, Jackson said he would ""give it a go"" and coach Jay Triano said the same. Either the front office is holding him out or maybe he tweaked something in warmups, but the Suns will surely lock down the worst record in the NBA with a loss tonight. This game has blowout written all over it and we're going to see a lot of players that casual NBA fans didn't know existed.

             That's more like it. Powell actually tweaked an ankle this game and went back to the locker room, but returned and seemed fine the rest of the night. Powell had a really strong postseason in 2016-17, so the Raptors would be thrilled if he could find his form over the next week -- he's been a huge letdown for most of the campaign after signing his new deal. If the Raptors rest more players on Monday, Powell could have some streaming appeal.

             Miles scored in single digits in each of his five previous games, but stepped up with DeMar DeRozan resting, hitting 6-of-13 shots and 5-of-6 free throws. It's unclear if the Raptors will rest anyone on Monday and Miles may even find himself picking up a DNP in the final two games, as Toronto has the No. 1 seed locked up. If DeRozan is active, Miles will be difficult to trust.

             The Suns are going to be extremely shorthanded tonight, so Jackson will try to play all the minutes he can handle. As for the rest of the rotation, things could get ugly real quick tonight with Devin Booker (hand), Marquese Chriss, Elfrid Payton (knee), T.J. Warren (knee), Tyson Chandler (veteran tank commander) and Alan Williams (knee) all out.

Chriss has had a really nice couple weeks, so maybe that's why they are holding him out -- the Suns can lock down the worst record with a loss tonight. Alex Len, Dragan Bender and Alec Peters will all be asked to step up in Chriss' absence.

             The Clippers are out of the playoff race and this elbow issue has apparently been bothering him for a couple weeks, but the Clippers could certainly use him with Lou Williams (ankle) considered doubtful. If Rivers is cleared to play, it would make some sense for the Clippers to watch his minutes closely. If he's out, Tyrone Wallace will be a popular streamer.

             The Raptors are currently up big and they should be able to pull out the win without FVV's services against the 24-55 Magic, so that could have something to do with why he's hitting the sidelines so early today. He'll end his evening with three assists, one block and two turnovers through nine minutes, and for now, we'll consider him questionable for Monday's game in Detroit.

             You could see this coming from a mile away with the No. 8 seed out of reach. Coach Doc Rivers already said he wasn't expecting Williams to play, and the Clippers may be without Austin Rivers (elbow, questionable) as well. That means we'll see more of C.J. Williams and Sindarius Thornwell, but Tyrone Wallace is the player fantasy owners will want to target.

             This explains why Jackson didn't play down the stretch. He did seem OK when he was on the floor, finishing with 13 points, four rebounds, three assists, two steals and two triples. If Jackson doesn't recover in time for Monday's game vs. the Raptors, expect Ish Smith to step up. Smith had 11 points and 11 assists in 28 minutes Sunday.

Jakob Poeltl will pick up some extra minutes in his absence, but he's little more than a low-end, shot-blocking specialist in deep leagues.

             He played 18 minutes for the second straight game, adding one rebound and four triples. The Pistons have brought the second-year forward along very slowly, but you'd think he'd be ready to step into the primary backup role behind Blake Griffin at the expense of Anthony Tolliver in 2018-19. With two games left and Griffin's ankle still bothering him, we should see plenty more of Ellenson in the final week.

            Dillon Brooks posted a gem of a line on Sunday vs. Detroit, scoring 22 points with eight assists, eight rebounds, two steals and one triple.
        
        
             He was one of four Grizzlies to score 20 or more points along with Marc Gasol, Kobi Simmons and MarShon Brooks as Memphis finished with a season-high 130 points. The eight assists were a career-high from Brooks and not a total fluke after finishing with six in his previous game. The second-round pick has exceeded expectations all season and we'd expect him to have a significant role on the wings in 2018-19, especially if Tyreke Evans leaves.

            Marc Gasol nearly triple-doubled in Sunday's win over the Pistons, scoring 20 points with nine rebounds, nine assists, one steal, one block and three triples in 35 minutes.
        
        
             This season has been a disaster for Memphis, but Gasol can hold his head high. Following tonight's game, he became just the third player in NBA history with 300 assists, 100 blocks and 100 triples in a season. He played 35 minutes tonight for the first time since March 17th, so we're expecting the Grizzlies to hold him out for at least one of their final two games.

             He played 21+ minutes in each of his previous five games, but this was his best performance by a mile. He hit 7-of-10 shots including four 3-pointers, adding a career-high seven assists with two boards and one turnover in 32 minutes. Just 20 years old, Simmons is making his case to open the 2018-19 season as Mike Conley's backup and should get another extended look in Memphis' final two games.

             Ojeleye got some extended minutes in this one with the game getting out of hand and Marcus Morris (rest) unavailable, but he's been far too inconsistent this season to trust him in most settings.

             Bird was coming off a career-high 15-point outing, but with Jayson Tatum back in action, he didn't see quite as much opportunity. Because Bird is on a two-way deal, he will not be available to the Celtics during the postseason unless they sign him to a rest-of-season contract, but in order to do that, they'd need to cut someone.

            Greg Monroe went 7-of-8 from the field and 3-of-4 from the stripe on his way to 17 points in Sunday's 112-106 loss to the Hawks.
        
        
             Monroe added two rebounds, four assists, one steal and two turnovers in the 22 minutes he was out there, and while this was a productive stat line, Monroe won't be hitting 87.5% of his shot attempts on most nights. If Al Horford gets rested again over Boston's final two games, Monroe will be someone to think about as a streamer, but he's far less attractive when the Celtics bigs are active.

             Horford did most of his damage through the first half of action, scoring 14 of his 16 points on 4-of-9 shooting (4-of-4 from the line), but on the whole, the Celtics starters didn't play all that well, particularly on the defensive end which resulted in the main guys getting benched down the stretch.

             Foul trouble was a bit of an issue in this one, and Tatum was also regularly roasted by Taurean Prince on the other end of the floor, which resulted in him riding the pine through the entire fourth quarter of action. Jaylen Brown joined him on the bench through the final frame in what was an embarrassing loss to the 24-57 Hawks, finishing with 12 points, three rebounds, two assists, one steal, one block and one turnover in 28 minutes.

             Rozier had been seriously struggling with his jumper over the previous two games, hitting just 23.5% of his shots, so it was nice to see him finish 4-of-9 from the field in this one. Shane Larkin finished with six points, seven assists, two rebounds, one steal and one turnover in 21 minutes off the bench, and while he has been solid with the dimes over the past two games, Rozier is still the PG you want to own in Boston.

             Lee replaced Isaiah Taylor in the starting unit, and he was crucial for the Hawks late, helping them go on a big run in the fourth to secure a victory over the No. 2 seeded Celtics. He's not the most consistent guy out there, but over the past five, he's come through with averages of 12.0 points, 6.2 boards, 2.4 dimes, 1.0 triple, 1.0 steal and 1.6 turnovers per contest on 41.0% shooting.

            Isaiah Taylor played well despite getting demoted to the second unit on Sunday, finishing with 16 points, six assists, two rebounds and one turnover in 28 minutes.
        
        
             Taylor had been struggling with his jumper over the previous two games, connecting on just 22.2% of his shot attempts, so perhaps going up against the opposing team's B-squad helped him get going tonight. He should be a fixture in the rotation regardless of how he enters the game with Atlanta so ridiculously banged up, but inconsistency will relegate him to deep league status.

             Ilyasova went 5-of-10 from the field and added one 3-pointer, three assists and one turnover while he was out there, and he's really stepped up for Philly ever since Joel Embiid (orbital fracture) hit the sidelines. Richaun Holmes ended his evening with eight points, five boards, one assist and one steal in 21 minutes off the bench, and while he too has seen some increased opportunity with Embiid out, it's been Ilyasova who has been the more impactful player in fantasy hoops.

             RoCo was efficient with his shot in this one, going 5-of-9 from the field and 2-of-2 from the charity stripe on his way to three 3-pointers, three assists, two steals, two swats and just one turnover through 34 minutes of floor time. The 76ers now sit a full game ahead of Cleveland for the No. 3 seed out East, and they'll clinch that spot if they can win out their final two games of the year.

             It wasn't the best stat line, but this was certainly an improvement from Friday's three-point, 1-of-9 shooting disaster, and as an added bonus for 9-cat owners, Saric didn't turn the ball over once. With the win, Philly notched their 50th W of the season, which is the first time they've accomplished that feat since 2001.

             Barnes couldn't get anything to drop early on, missing his first seven attempts and not getting his first bucket until the second quarter of action. He also wasn't very effective in the other areas of the box score, finishing with just two 3-pointers, three rebounds, two assists, two turnovers and no defensive statistics, and after logging 43 minutes in this one, he might get rested on Tuesday.

             Ball has just two chances to return this season on Tuesday vs. the Rockets or Wednesday vs. the Clippers, but it's a safe bet that he'll sit out at least one of those. He was able to go through some drills on Saturday, so it will be interesting to see if he returns to full practice on Monday. Alex Caruso and Tyler Ennis will hold down the fort once again.

It's no surprise to see the Lakers play it safe with less than a week left in the season. Josh Hart will start in his place and is a strong play in all formats.

However, with Smith Jr. logging massive minutes, and the Mavs scheduled for a matchup against the Suns on Tuesday for a battle to the bottom, it wouldn't be surprising to see DSJ sit out the final game of the season for Dallas.

             Sabonis had been struggling with his jumper in the two games prior, connecting on just 27.3% of his attempts, so it was nice to see him bust loose for a big stat line today and his strong play essentially kept Myles Turner and Thaddeus Young off the court.

             Foul trouble was an issue, and with Domantas Sabonis catching fire and popping off for 30 points, Turner was on a very short leash. This was his second scoreless performance of the year, but arguably, his worst game of the season. He's been seriously slumping over the past four games, churning out meager averages of 4.8 points, 2.5 boards and 0.8 blocks on 32.0% shooting.

            Thaddeus Young was held to just two points on 1-of-2 shooting in Sunday's win over the Hornets, adding three rebounds, three steals and nothing else over 17 minutes.
        
        
             This was the second game in a row that Young was limited to just 17 minutes of floor time, and it was also his second consecutive outing being held to under five points. Domantas Sabonis was partly the reason why Young was limited in this one, as he went off for a career-high 30 points, but maybe Thaddeus will be able to turn things around on Tuesday with a rematch against Charlotte.

             Oladipo was uncharacteristically held to just five points on 2-of-9 shooting Friday, but the Pacers did a good job to get him involved early in order ensure the bounce-back performance. Additionally, Oladipo has now recorded at least one steal in 64 straight games, tying him for fourth all-time in that category with Mike Conley.

             Collison also added four assists, one 3-pointer, one rebound and one turnover, but with the game essentially being over by the third quarter, he took an early seat on the bench and didn't log a single minute during crunch time. Still, this was a much better performance following Friday's two-point, 1-of-7 shooting game.

             Cook has certainly earned it, pumping out averages of 15.1 points, 2.3 triples, 4.2 assists and just 1.5 turnovers per game through 16 starts this season. The Dubs' cut Omri Casspi to make room for Cook's contract, and he'll likely open up the first-round as Oakland's starting point guard.

            Guerschon Yabusele (knee) will not play on Sunday vs. the Hawks.
        
        
             His MRI came back ""clear,"" but he still has some soreness and the Celtics will play it safe. Yabusele wasn't going to be a great fantasy play anyways with Al Horford returning from a rest day.

            Gary Harris (knee) is doubtful to return before the end of the regular season.
        
        
             This means Harris will be held out of Monday's game vs. Portland and Wednesday's game vs. Minnesota. Their playoff hopes are going to come down to the wire and it's a tough blow that they will be without the player that coach Malone called their MVP. ""Right now, I’m not expecting Gary Harris back [in the regular season],"" coach Malone said. ""We have to continue to find ways to win games and compete at a high level with the players that are available, and Gary’s not on that list right now.""

Kerr said a while ago that Curry wouldn't play in the first round of the playoffs, and it's unclear if his stance has changed since then. We'll have an update next weekend, but expect to see a lot of Quinn Cook for the foreseeable future.

He averaged 5.3 points, 4.3 rebounds, 0.9 assists, 0.8 blocks and 0.5 steals in 14.8 minutes per game, but he was a lot better than his numbers suggested.

            Lonzo Ball (left knee contusion) was able to go through some drills on Saturday.
        
        
             This explains why the Lakers upgraded him to questionable for Sunday's game vs. the Jazz. The Lakers will see how Ball is feeling before making the call, but it's unclear if they will make it during shootaround or warmups. If Ball is able to play, Alex Caruso and Tyler Ennis will lose their streaming appeal.

             It's a bit surprising that Griffin hasn't been ruled out for the season yet, but coach Stan Van Gundy is probably hoping to have him for one of Detroit's final two games. They can't make the playoffs and don't need to tank without their first-round pick, so they don't have anything left to play for. Anthony Tolliver and Henry Ellenson will step up again.

He also added four rebounds, three assists and a blocked shot while adding a plus-16 rating. He'll be an important cog off the bench if San Antonio is going to last further than the first round in the playoffs.

             The Spurs were on the outside looking in as far as the playoffs were concerned a few weeks ago. However, Aldridge and his teammates have banded together to win 10 in a row at home to get themselves right back into playoff shape. They might not necessarily go as far as Spurs teams have in the past, but they will be a tough out for one of the top contenders, especially if Kawhi Leonard can rejoin the team, too.

             Tucker was very efficient, hitting 6-of-8 from the floor, including 4-of-6 from behind the 3-point line. He might have done even more offensive damage if he wasn't worried about the referee's whistle. Tucker ended up with five personal fouls and had to be careful in the second half.

             He's been so good that this line isn't even that great by his standards. Holiday was also on Kevin Durant a lot today, which shows his versatility on both sides of the ball. Holiday is probably going to be a second-round pick next season.

            James Harden posted a game-high 26 points over 36 minutes but it wasn't enough in Saturday's 108-102 home loss against the Thunder.
        
        
             Harden also contributed nine assists, four rebounds, a steal and a blocked shot while turning it over five times. His minutes were curtailed slightly because he was in foul trouble, and that didn't help Houston's cause as they dropped their home finale. The Beard will look to finish up strong on the road against the Lakers on Tuesday and the Kings on Wednesday.

             Capela did his part, hitting 5-of-6 from the floor with just two turnovers, and he probably should've chipped in even more on offense since he had the hot hand down low. The six-point loss snapped a 20-game home winning streak for the Rockets in their final regular-season game in front of the home folks. Their final two games are on the road against the Lakers on Tuesday and against the Kings on Wednesday.

             Westbrook needs to post 34 rebounds and 12 assists over his final two regular-season games to average a triple-double for the 2017-18 campaign. He'll be working in Miami on Monday night against a team allowing just 102.7 points per game, fifth-best scoring defense in the NBA, and against the tanking Grizzlies at home on Wednesday in the finale.

             Abrines had a nightmare shooting performance, hitting 1-of-8 from behind the 3-point line, including an ugly 0-of-7 from behind the arc. The Thunder have some depth issues heading into the postseason and that's likely to be their undoing against other deeper clubs in the Western Conference. They need guys like Abrines, Raymond Felton and Jerami Grant to do better if they're going to avoid being one-and-done in the playoffs.

Slowly but surely the Melo of old is shining through a lot more lately. He is averaging 18.3 points, 7.3 rebounds and 3.0 3-pointers per game over his past four outings. That's good news for OKC as they get primed and ready for the postseason.

             He blocked Quinn Cook on the last play of the game to make this line even sweeter. James Harden will be winning MVP this year, but all fantasy owners know that The Brow is the fantasy MVP and it's not close at all. Since the break and even before this gem, AD averaged 30.2 points, 12.0 boards, 2.1 dimes, 1.9 steals, 3.5 boards and 0.7 treys on 52.4 FG% and 86.8 FT% over his previous 22. He's almost twice as valuable as anyone else in fantasy and he will be on a lot of title teams. The Pelicans also needed this win with the Spurs, Thunder, Wolves, Jazz and Nuggets all winning their last game.

All the razor companies should be on clean-shaven Mirotic for an endorsement deal with this gem and a 31-point Friday.

The Warriors not playing well could give KD a chance to play in both of the final games.

             Coach Steve Kerr still doesn't know what to do with his starting center spot for the postseason. It's not crazy at all to think Looney can be the man, and he's clearly earned a rotation spot. Kerr really talked up Looney before the game, and his non-scoring aspects of his game have really improved. Looney has turned his career around in a hurry and is worth owning in most leagues.

             That's a career high in triples for Acy with 3-pointers being the story today. The Nets had a franchise-record 24 treys in this game, and they were just one shy of the NBA record (Cavs last year). Knicks fans may remember when Acy got the MVP chants at MSG earlier in his career, and he was in that form today. He's not much of a fantasy add, though.

             He hit the Nets' single-game record 22nd trey in this game, making 4-of-5 overall. He also has five-plus dimes in two straight games for the first time in his career. Sure, Victor Oladipo, Clint Capela and others get the Most Improved Player love, but Harris has been tremendous the season.

             He's shooting more jumpers, the fouls are going down, the blocks are going up, and now Allen has a block in 12 straight. His help defense has been great for a 19-year-old rookie, and he is the first Nets rookie since Sean Williams (2007-08 season) to register four-plus blocks in consecutive games. We apologize in advance for driving his ADP up next year.

             It looked like he was in for a mega line with 13 points in the first quarter, but he was quiet after that. Portis isn't going to play this much when Lauri Markkanen comes back, but he still should have value on a team with a front office trying to lose games. In honor of Coolio performing at half today, the Bulls are livin' in a tanksta's paradise as they come along and ride on a tank-tastic voyage.

             Brogdon was probable for Saturday's game, but ended up sitting out one extra game. The guard did do some on-court work before the game, however. He has been on the shelf since Feb. 1 due to a partially torn left quadriceps tendon. ""I'll be back Monday,"" he told beat writer Matt Velazquez. The team likely wants to see him prove his health in a game before the playoffs start, but you can probably expect a minutes cap.

             He's absolutely rolling. O’Quinn is the first Knick since Patrick Ewing in 1999 to record at least 13 points, 12 rebounds and three blocks in three straight games. If you added him after the Enes Kanter injury, it could be the difference in your championship. He's also a real joy to watch, so it's been an enjoyable experience all around.

            Tony Snell (ankle) has returned on Saturday.
        
        
             That's great news for the Bucks because the ankle issue was scary.  Snell is moving around fine on his first few possessions.

            Tony Snell turned his right ankle in the first quarter on Saturday and went to the locker room.
        
        
             He stepped on John Henson's foot and rolled his right ankle pretty good. Snell took about 30-45 seconds to get up and he walked slowly to the locker room. He's likely out for the night, which means more Jason Terry and Brandon Jennings.

             Huge positive news for his fantasy owners here. He has said he wanted to play for a few days now, but the training staff had a big say. He talked to the trainers just now and apparently they're happy with how his ankle responded to warmups. Shabazz Napier will be moving to the bench.

             The Nuggets put on an offensive clinic and it felt like the Clippers only had four guys on defense today. They are clicking at the right time with a five-game winning streak and Jokic is the main reason why, averaging 19.4 points, 12.0 boards, 7.6 assists, 1.6 steals, 1.6 blocks and 1.8 treys on a 60.3 TS% in those. The Nuggets have a tall order to make the playoffs and it's starting to feel like their Wednesday game against the Wolves could be the decider.

             Now that's some efficiency with his 18 possessions giving him a 1.72 points per possession today. He's a pure scorer and it's no secret how he gets his buckets, so nobody can complain about Thrill holding the ball too much. Barton has come a long way from his Blazers days and was paid $3.5 million this season, so he will be getting a hefty raise this summer.

The Blue Arrow himself is also dishing more often with seven dimes in three of his last four. Murray is just 21 and he's going to get even better next year.

             He was playing through an ankle injury from Thursday, so the Clippers will hold him out. That should put Tyrone Wallace in a big spot while C.J.

             That means Kobi Simmons should get a start while MarShon Brooks continues his incredible surge to close this season. If not for MarShon this team would be one of the hardest teams to watch in a long time.

After the game, he told reporters that the ankle was throbbing and that ""it is kind of hard to move around on two flat tires."" It's actually somewhat surprising he is listed as questionable, and not doubtful or out. We should have an update on his status Sunday morning after shootaround.

             The Clippers may have played their worst defensive game of the season and not many players seem to care about moving the ball on offense. Wallace was easily the most energetic Clipper on the court, and he's earned more minutes to finish up the year. If the Clips do rest guys, Wallace could be posting some big lines.

             There was some hope that Ingram would be returning to the lineup, as he was able to ride a stationary bike on Thursday, which is the first step in the concussion protocol. However, the fact that he's been ruled out 24 hours ahead of Sunday's game suggests he's still a ways away. With just two (relatively meaningless) games remaining in the Lakers season after Sunday, L.A. may choose to err on the side of caution and shut him down early next week.

             He had a rough start with his 3-of-11 shooting line to begin this game, but Williams got hot to make it closer in the start of the fourth quarter. With the Clippers now out, Williams could be looking at a game off after his Sixth Man of the Year season.

             The Clippers are now out of the playoffs and it was clear that fact provoked some thoughts. In the final minutes, DeAndre Jordan stat silently and it looked like he had some things on his mind regarding free agency this summer. Expect Jordan to get a night off in the final two games.

If he's out, some guy most NBA fans have probably never heard of will get minutes. Kidding aside, Danuel House, Davon Reed and Shaq Harrison will be getting some heavy burn.

             The Jazz were managing his hamstring soreness on Thursday night with a heat pad, but they ruled him out for the second half. This issue is clearly bothering him since last month, so he could sit. If he is not going to play, that'll likely put Royce O'Neale in the first unit for a prime spot while Dante Exum backs him up. Exum looked terrific on Thursday.

However, coach Joe Prunty tempered expectations by calling Brogdon’s status ""doubtful"" as they wait for final confirmation. Malcolm said he was GTD, depending on how he feels pregame. This game tips off at 7:30, so we should have an update at approximately 6:00 pm, when Prunty address the media.

             Ross has been sidelined since late November, when he underwent surgery after suffering a sprained MCL and a non-displaced fracture of his tibial plateau. Then, as during his rehab, he had a setback due to a bone bruise. It's somewhat surprising that he would return with only three games remaining in the season. He should be left on waivers, as the Magic will almost certainly limit his minutes significantly.

However, the Magic play the back end of a back-to-back on Monday in Milwaukee, so it's possible they get another day off.  Bismack Biyombo started Friday night, but will get bumped back to the bench Sunday.

            The Grizzlies announced on Friday that they signed F Omari Johnson to a multi-year contract.
        
        
             Johnson started 38 of his 44 appearances this season with the Grizzlies’ NBA G League affiliate and averaged 16.6 points, 6.4 rebounds and 1.6 assists in 27.9 minutes while shooting 46.0 percent from the field and 41.7 percent from 3-point range. The contract almost certainly includes a team option for next season.

            Ivica Zubac ended up with 14 points and nine rebounds over 22 minutes off the bench in Friday's loss against the Timberwolves.
        
        
             Zubac split the center minutes with Brook Lopez, whose presence keeps Zubac from reaching his fantasy ceiling. This was his best performance in a while, and he nearly had his first double-double since Feb. 15 which also happened to be against the Timberwolves. Unless Lopez goes down to injury or is rested down the stretch, Zubac's fantasy appeal is rather limited.

             Randle posted 5-of-11 from the field while going 10-of-10 from the free-throw stripe. He added two assists with five turnovers, so it wasn't the most efficient night for Randle. Still, he has emerged as a must-start fantasy option in all formats this season, and he might just be scratching the surface. Next up is a visit against the Jazz and their strong defense on Sunday afternoon.

             Hart hit 6-of-12 from the field, including 3-of-6 from behind the 3-point line, while adding 5-of-7 from the charity stripe. The former standout at Villanova produced his second double-double in five games since returning from a broken left hand, but this was easily his most impressive performance since making his way back. There are plenty of minutes on the table for Hart with several injuries to the Lakers.

             Lopez ended up hitting 7-of-10 from the field, including 2-of-3 from behind the 3-point line, and he did not show any ill effects of the nagging back issue which has had him listed on the injury report recently. He also added six rebounds with just one turnover. He had an amazing March, rolling for 18.7 points, 4.6 rebounds and 1.7 blocked shots per game, but he started April on a cool note. It's nice to see him bounce back after managing just 9.7 points and 3.7 rebounds over the past three outings.

             Dudley ended up going 0-of-1 from the field with one rebound and one steal in the return. He will fight for scraps for the remainder of the season and he isn't someone to rely upon in seasonal fantasy leagues or DFS play.

             It's Gibson's second straight strong showing after some erratic play to close out March and a stinker to open the month of April. He is averaging 17.5 points, 12.0 rebounds and 1.5 3-pointers per outing while hitting 50.0 percent (14-of-28) from the floor in his past two outings.

The team obviously wanted him to get back and get his legs under him before what they hope will be a long playoff run.

             Kuzma suffered a sprained left ankle during Friday's game against Minnesota and he attempted to play through the pain. However, in the third quarter he reportedly told head coach Luke Walton, ""You gotta get me out,"" something he typically does not do. With little left to play for in the Lakers' season, it wouldn't be surprising to see him shut down for the remainder of the schedule.

He is still trending in the right direction, posting eight consecutive games with double-digit point totals, the second-longest of his career. Ulis gets strong at the end of the season apparently, as his career-long streak with 10 or more points was last season in the final nine outings.

It might be too little too late in the Rookie of the Year race, but he, Devin Booker and an early pick in the first round of the 2018 NBA Draft make this Phoenix team one to watch in the near future.

            Jordan Crawford was good for 13 points across just nine minutes off the bench in Friday's 122-103 victory in Phoenix.
        
        
             Crawford hit 4-of-7 from behind the 3-point line in short order, giving the team a big boost off the bench. He was out of basketball for five months, but he's back in business and he looked good from the perimeter. He could be a valuable contributor from downtown for the team in the playoffs and a cheap DFS option if he can knock off the rust and get hot.

             Holiday, Anthony Davis and Nikola Mirotic were the team's Big Three against the overmatched Suns, powering the Pelicans to the fifth spot in the Western Conference standings with three regular-season games remaining. Holiday finished 8-of-15 from the field, including 4-of-6 from behind the 3-point line. His four triples were the most in a single game since he five shots from downtown in Denver back on Dec. 15.

             It was Mirotic's best scoring game since coming over in a trade from the Bulls, and he tied his previously best in rebounds, as he also had 16 boards in a game at Brooklyn on Feb. 10. He is averaging 28.0 points, 11.5 rebounds, 4.0 3-pointers and 1.0 blocked shots per game across his past two outings. Next up will be a bigger challenge on the road against the Warriors on Saturday.

            Kyle Kuzma left Friday's game against the Timberwolves due to a sprained left ankle and he was unable to return.
        
        
             Kuzma rolled his ankle and initially tried to play through the injury, but the pain apparently became too much and he was forced out for good. His injury led to more playing time for Channing Frye in the second half. For now, consider Kuzma day to day. The team has just three games remaining in the regular season, so it's uncertain if we'll see him again or not.

             The Grizzlies finally gave him a full workload after playing him an average of 25.3 minutes in his previous three games. It's easy to see why the Grizzlies quickly signed him to a two-year deal and it's not a stretch to think that he could be their best wing for 2018-19. He's a must-start player for their final three games and might be the only player you can rely on with Marc Gasol resting so much.

             He was on fire early with 12 points in his first five minutes, and Brown kept it going in a dream matchup. Thanks to the hot shooting from deep, Brown is the first Celtics player in franchise history to record 30+ points and seven+ threes at the age of 21-years-old or younger. Brown is a quote machine, but he took one from Terry Rozier as what has been a rally cry for the banged-up Celtics.  ""Like Terry said, no fear, no doubt in our eyes,"" Brown said about the shape of the team. He's playing point guard and will have to be huge in the playoffs.

             Marc Gasol was resting up for his offseason vacation, Jarell Martin's (ankle) season is over and JaMychal Green (knee) is still out, so we may be seeing a lot more of Rabb in Memphis' final three games. He blocked three shots in the loss to go with four assists and one steal in 31 minutes, and he's now played 24+ minutes in three straight games with 11.3 points, 10.3 boards, 1.3 assists and 1.0 blocks in that span. He's worth a look if you need a big man, but his upside won't be as high when Gasol is active.

             What? Not only was it the second triple-double of his career, but it was the first trip-dub from a Celtics center since Robert Parish in 1987. Obviously Al Horford not playing in this game set him up and Marcus Morris getting ejected was another factor. Monroe could get a night off, but he could really produce in the nights he's active.

             He's been a little up and down, and there's a big grain of salt here going up against Andrew Harrison and other young guards. Still, Jackson has played well enough to be used when active, but the Pistons have nothing to play for now.

             Yuck. DSJ tried to throw one down on Andre Drummond, but the big man wasn't having it. Before the game, coach Rick Carlisle really talked up his rookie. ""He’s fresher and more spry physically now than he was early. And mentally his head is clear and he’s ready to go every day,"" Carlisle said. Every day? So why didn't he play on Wednesday? Tanking thoughts aside, hopefully Smith Jr. suits up for the rest of the game.

             It wasn't a great game for the rookie, but he was clutch down the stretch -- he hit the game-winning jumper and stole an inbounds pass on Memphis' final possession. He hit just 4-of-11 shots from the field and missed all five of his triples, but he did put up 18.5 points, 3.5 rebounds, 2.5 assists, 1.0 steals and 3.0 triples in his previous two April games. The 24-year-old rookie should be pretty safe to deploy for Sacramento's final two games.

             Not bad against Andre Drummond. The Mavs have talked about playing him bigger minutes for a while now, and apparently that time is now with 41 minutes also coming on Wednesday. He really doesn't have any serious competition for minutes right now, so Motley is probably worth a pickup in all leagues on the days he's playing.

             Apart from Tyler Johnson, the rest of the starting lineup played under 24 minutes because of the lopsided score. The Heat can finish anywhere from No. 6 to No. 8 in the East, so for now Johnson's owners should expect him to be active for Monday's game vs. the Thunder and Wednesday's game vs. the Raptors. With that said, there is a chance that they try to get sneaky and slide into the No. 7 spot for a matchup with Boston.

             With respect to Donovan Mitchell, Simmons locked up Rookie of Year in one of the best games of the season. He almost had a trip-dub at half, and now only seven active players have more triple-doubles than the rookie. Ben has been ridiculous over this 13-game win streak, averaging 14.6 points, 10.3 boards, 11.1 assists, 1.8 steals and 0.6 blocks on a 60 TS%. The 76ers have the inside track for the No. 3 seed and nobody will want to play them. Trust. The. Process.

             When Kornet plays well, he can put up some sexy fantasy lines. The problem is that he's been ice cold prior to Friday, scoring a combined seven points in his previous three games. With three games remaining and Enes Kanter (back) still banged up, maybe Kornet can finish the season on a high note and force his way into a timeshare with Kyle O'Quinn.

Despite the poor shooting night all around for the team, the Raps were able to post a new franchise record for wins in a season with 57. They won the Atlantic Division for the fourth time in the past five years, and they clinched the No. 1 seed in the Eastern Conference for the first time in team history.

             It's fair to say he wasn't healthy today as he gets over an elbow injury. Hopefully, he's over his injury before the postseason. Saric has been a knockdown shooter all season and has been a strong all-around scorer.

They still won by 19, as Indiana was even worse at just 29.9 percent (26-of-87). The good news is Lowry and his fellow starters will have three games to redeem themselves, as head coach Dwane Casey said his team will not rest before the playoffs. ""Nope. That's bull crap. We can't think rest, we have to think rhythm,"" Casey said.

             He became the first Knicks rookie to record at least 30 points and 10 rebounds off the bench. This comes out of nowhere, as he scored a combined 32 points in his previous 10 appearances. Michael Beasley left the game in the first minute with a knee contusion and Tim Hardaway Jr. sprained his ankle in the third quarter, so Dotson could be looking at plenty of minutes and shots in the final three games.

             He landed awkwardly and was grabbing his ankle in pain towards the end of the third quarter, but he was able to limp to the locker room under his own power. He never returned to the game, though the Knicks did have a comfortable lead at the time. THJ finished with 15 points, five assists, four rebounds, two steals and four triples. With just three games left and nothing to play for, there's a good chance THJ misses time beginning on Saturday vs. the Bucks.

             It was a pretty pitiful showing all around for Indiana, as they ended up hitting just 29.9 percent from the field as a team. Turner was just 1-of-5 from the field, including 0-of-1 from down deep, while adding just four rebounds, two blocked shots and a steal. Turner's minus-27 rating was the worst on the team, and all five starters were minus-12 or worse.

             Collison was 1-of-7 from the field with a minus-12 rating, and that was actually the best mark among the team's starting five. It was an ugly night all around for the guys wearing mustard and blue. Only two Indiana players finished with double-digit point totals, and none of them were among the starters.

             This was a letdown from Satoransky, but no one besides Bradley Beal played particularly well in the humiliating loss. Wall should be back for Tuesday's game vs. Boston, but Satoransky may get one more chance to start on Wednesday vs. the Magic on the second night of a back-to-back. He's safe to drop with three days off, though.

             It was a frightful night of shooting for all Pacers, as Robinson was the only player to make more buckets than he missed, going 4-of-7 from the field, including 3-of-5 from behind the 3-point line. Indiana ended up shooting just 29.9 percent (26-87) on the evening, and the five starters were just 8-of-36 (22.2 percent) from the field.

             Incredibly, this was his first game with 30+ minutes since Feb. 10 and that's only because Markieff Morris was ejected in the first quarter. That speaks volumes about his letdown of a season as the 34-year-old veteran has looked washed for most of the campaign. Expect his workload to be back in the 20s for the final two games, unless of course he's rested in one of those.

             Sure, a 44-point triple-double is cool and Ben Simmons putting up an epic stat line is fun, but Green dropping a 33-point game with 100-plus TS% is easily the most shocking part of this box scores -- he went 8-of-8 from the line, too. On night's he's not resting, he's going to be starting every game the rest of the way and he's been a better fit next to LeBron than anyone could've thought.

             That's the fourth straight loss for Washington and coach Scott Brooks was pretty animated after the game. ""It’s embarrassing that we don’t play with the passion we need to play at,"" Brooks said. ""We're a selfish basketball team right now."" The Wizards dropped to the No. 8 seed following this loss, and now they may not be able to rest Beal in one of their final two games as they fight for the No. 7 seed and a chance to face a Boston team that will be missing Kyrie Irving, Gordon Hayward and Marcus Smart.

             The Cavs gave him some important shots late, but he didn't come through. Osman had a tough time on defense in this game and his minutes went up slightly because Rodney Hood (Achilles) didn't play in the second half. He's more valuable in reality than in fantasy.

             The Hornets front office has to feel at least a little better now that Monk is starting to produce. He becomes the second Hornets rookie since Kemba Walker to score 20-plus points in consecutive games, and hey Donovan Mitchell didn't score 20 in his last one. Kemba's minutes are being dialed back and Monk is playing some wing, so he could actually have a solid week to close out his rookie year. He's an offensive specialist with what should be a lot of volume.

             He's not putting up stats these days with only 39 points over his last four games combined.

             The Magic could shut down Aaron Gordon (calf) for the season and the Magic are fairly thin on wings, so Artis may find himself getting minutes in the 30s. He's not much of a stat producer outside of points, but he did score 18 and 16 in his previous two. He's on the radar in standard leagues, especially if you want points.

             That is filling it up in limited time. Augustin is going to have to keep doing it because Rodney Purvis will get minutes. Plus, don't be shocked if DJA gets a night off soon.

             He was considered questionable to play, but he didn't have any limitations and was great down the stretch with 10 points in the fourth. He's heating up again and is coming off a 20-point game, and he should be safe for his fantasy owners to deploy since the Hawks have no reason to sit him in their final two games vs. Boston and Philly, both of which should be comfortable losses.

             He should be getting minutes the rest of the way as the Magic evaluate him as a center. He's also played some PF with some difficult matchups, and maybe he makes the rotation next year. Birch could be a sneaky player to use in DFS or as a deep-league add.

             He received double technicals after an argument with Marcus Morris and there was a little bit of shoving. To be clear, it wasn't that serious and a suspension isn't likely. Portis finished with six points and seven rebounds in 14 minutes.

On Saturday, he was chatting with C.J. Miles and touched a ref after, but this time it was Bobby Portis that upset him. The Celtics are going to be really shorthanded at forward to finish this one.

             Even though he left the game in the first minute after bumping knees, the Knicks waited over an hour to rule him out. There's no word of any tests and we'll assume that he's day-to-day for now. Damyean Dotson is having a solid game and looks like the primary beneficiary if Beasley misses additional time.

             Yeah, these lineups are fun in Memphis tonight. Either way, you were starting MarShon regardless and he should be owned in all leagues.

             They can't win games or even announce the correct lineups anymore (this is their third try). Barring another change, they will go with De'Aaron Fox, Bogdan Bogdanovic, Justin Jackson, JaKarr Sampson and Willie Cauley-Stein. Z-Bo hasn't played in seven straight and there's no guarantee that changes tonight, even with Skal Labissiere out.

             The Grizzlies are basically running out of bigs, so Davis and Rabb should be busy. Both make a lot of sense in DFS and are worth an add for short-term value. Although, Davis would lose value if Marc Gasol is back.

             No surprise here after a successful start vs. the Wizards on Thursday, including a game-sealing steal vs. John Wall. The 76ers will be throwing out a lot of bigger lineups, and maybe LeBron James guards Ben Simmons, too. Osman is probably looking at around 20-24 minutes, but he won't be asked to do much more than hit open shots or earn hustle stats.

             In other words, he is getting over his concussion and should advance in the concussion protocol. Embiid also had a post-operative exam on his facial surgery, so obviously that will keep him out longer than it will take for him to move through the protocol. Richaun Holmes and Ersan Ilyasova should benefit most while others get more usage while Embiid could be out for 1-3 more weeks.

The Wolves need this Friday game in a big way, and a loss could move them out of the top eight for the postseason. He could have some sort of restriction tonight, but Nemanja Bjelica will be losing minutes.

             With the No. 2 seed in the East already locked up, the shorthanded Celtics want to make sure they don't lose any more key players to injury. Nonetheless, it's a tough blow for fantasy owners who are still playing for their league championship. With Horford sidelined, Aron Baynes and Greg Monroe will be the primary beneficiaries. However, it'd difficult to trust either player Friday night in DFS or as a streamer. Marcus Morris will also see an uptick in minutes.

             D'Antoni told reporters that Gordon's status for Saturday's game will depend on how he looks in practice on Friday afternoon. We should have an update shortly. If Gordon is unable to suit up, Luc Mbah a Moute, P.J. Tucker and Gerald Green would likely divvy up extra minutes.

The Heat are in an unusual position as they sit in the No. 6 seed, but it's no secret that most teams would probably prefer to play the No. 2 Celtics over the 76ers or Cavs. The Heat could potentially try to tank it to land at seven, and they've already clinched a spot anyway.

             Dragic did not suit up on Wednesday, but it appears it was more about rest than an ankle issue, as the Heat have already clinched a playoff berth. Tyler Johnson started for Miami on Wednesday, but will get bumped back to the bench with Dragic returning to game action. The Knicks are terrible defensively, so Dragic should be able to post solid numbers Friday night, as long as the contest stays close.

What may be even worse is that he couldn't even get to 40 games despite not having a somewhat serious injury with the main reasons being soreness in his knees or rest. He'll be turning 30 just after next season starts and needless to say this contract was a disaster for the Grizzlies.

If it feels healthy, I’m going to come back even before that. But if it feels hurt … it wouldn’t be smart."" We should have an update on Friday morning after the Knicks shootaround.

             The Nuggets secured an immensely important victory on Thursday when they beat the Timberwolves. Denver is now tied with Minnesota for the eighth seed in the West. Harris has not played since March 15th and, according to Nuggets beat writer Harrison Wind, the best-case scenario for his return is Monday vs. Portland.

             Iguodala has missed each of the Warriors last four games, but has been inching closer to a return. Because Golden State is locked into the No. 2 seed, they have no desire to rush Iggy back, but they also want him to get into a rhythm before the postseason arrives. Nick Young, who has been ineffective, will see his minutes reduced with Iguodala back in the mix.

             It was a rough offensive game for him to start and fouls kept him off the court in key spots, but Jokic tipped in an offensive rebound to put the Nuggets up four with 4.3 second left. Jokic called it the biggest win of the year, but the Nuggets still have work to do. They're probably going to have to win out with games at the Clippers, home against the Blazers and a trip to Minnesota in the season finale. This should be fun and Jokic won't be resting.

             He had a couple big plays and was by far the best Nugget in plus-minus with a +15 today. Murray drew a foul on Karl-Anthony Towns to foul him out, and he made the two free throws to give the Nuggets the lead. Coach Mike Malone talked him up during the in-game TV interview, and he's always loved when Murray gets downhill. He had a low-key breakout season in reality and in fantasy.

It's been a while since Harris returned to his All-Star form from his 2008-09, but you could say the Nuggets would've lost this game without him. It doesn't sound like Gary Harris (knee) will play in the next couple, so Harris could get another chance to produce off the bench.

             It was a tough play to foul out as KAT leaned into Jamal Murray on a long jumper. It's just the third time he's fouled out all year, but Towns' fouls were on the rise with his 3.8 per game in March. Towns fouling out was huge in this loss because the Nuggets picked up three offensive boards down the stretch. The Wolves' lead for the postseason is now gone with a virtual tie with the Nuggets for No. 8 and No. 9. Towns looks like he'll be hitting 82 games again this season.

             This is probably going to be his last game in the starting lineup. Bjelica does play on Friday night and Jimmy Butler probably won't hit 35 minutes, so Bjelica's fantasy owners may want to hold him for Friday before dropping him.

             He has to have Defensive Player of the Year locked up as the Jazz win their fourth straight. Sure, he's not going to hit 60 games due to two knee injuries, but the Jazz are just so good with him on the court and it's not like Kawhi Leonard or Draymond Green are threatening him. Utah also has a comfortable lead to make the postseason and they're just two games behind the Blazers for the No. 3 seed, which is even more interesting because they play each other in the finale. Gobert is not likely going to rest this season.

             It looked like he was on his way to a monster game with 13 points in the first 10 minutes, but the Jazz went with more of a slowed-down, defensive approach. This snaps Mitchell's 10-game stretch with at least 20 points, but at least he made 7-of-8 from the line. The Rookie of the Year race is going to be tight with both Mitchell and Ben Simmons putting up two outstanding rookie campaigns.

             The knee issue was not apparent at all. Ingles has now totaled 200 threes on the year, the 10th quickest player in the NBA to that mark this season. He also becomes only the second international player to hit 200+ threes in a season (Peja Stojakovic, 2003-04 & 2007-08). He's one of the best shooters in the NBA.

             He's certainly healthy and Exum blocked a dunk attempt from Boban Marjanovic (video in link below). Exum could be looking at additional run because Ricky Rubio's hamstring issue isn't going away. He'll probably be coming off the bench either way, but Exum could find himself getting minutes in the upper 20s. If Rubio is indeed out, Exum could be worth a stream if you need a PG.

             The only blemish on Wall's evening was the six turnovers he committed, with the final one coming in the closing seconds of a one-possession game. Wall was instrumental in the Wizards building a 17-point lead with under eight minutes left, but then LeBron James took over. Nonetheless, Wall owners obviously have to be very happy with his production. However, Wall said on Thursday that he plans to rest Friday. After the game, coach Scott Brooks said that Wall ""probably"" won't play Friday, but added, ""you never know."" Check back Friday afternoon for an update.

             This is the second straight game in which Love has shot 50 percent from the floor and knocked down four treys. His rebounding numbers were a bit lower than usual in this one, but he'll look to remedy that Friday night vs. the Sixers. That game could very well decide who ends up securing the No. 3 seed in the East.

             He was playing well in the first half, started at power forward in the third quarter, and picked up minutes at center as the game was slipping away. Harrell is kind of hot over his last three with 17.3 points per game in that span, so he should be able to get minutes in the low 20s. The Clippers are also dangerously close to being eliminated, so Harrell could find himself getting big minutes if the Clippers do sit DeAndre Jordan.

             The Cavs trailed 104-87 with 7:35 remaining, before King James put Cleveland on his back to stun the Wizards. LeBron scored 13 of his 33 points in the fourth quarter. What is there left to say about James at this point? His numbers during this, his 15th season, almost seem like fiction. He's yet to miss a game all year and leads the league in minutes played. Over the Cavs last ten games, LeBron is averaging 30.1 points (on 53.4 percent shooting), 9.2 rebounds and 10.2 assists.

Over his last five, Wallace averaged 9.0 points, 4.0 boards, 1.6 assists, 1.2 blocks and 0.4 treys in 32.6 minutes per game. He's a lukewarm hold, but he's more of a stream.

With Damian Lillard (ankle) out and Shabazz Napier struggling, Baldwin gave the Blazers a nice lift on Thursday. However, Lillard is expected to return on Saturday, which means Baldwin will likely be knocked out of the rotation.

             Coach Terry Stotts also said he ""would hope so"" that Dame will play before the season ends. The Blazers are losing their grasp on the No. 3 seed with the Jazz getting another win, and going against the Spurs in San Antonio could be a factor. Lillard's ankle injury was never really considered serious, but the Blazers ruled him out after shootaround. This would obviously be great news for Lillard's fantasy owners while Shabazz Napier would take a hit.

             Napier was a very popular DFS play and streamer in daily leagues, but didn't quite deliver up to expectations in this one. After Thursday's loss, Damian Lillard (ankle) told ESPN that he is planning on returning to the Blazers lineup for Saturday's game vs. the Spurs. You may want to wait until it's confirmed by the team, but Napier should be dropped as soon as we're sure Lillard is coming back.

            Joe Harris scored 17 points with four rebounds, six assists and three 3-pointers in 29 minutes against the Bucks during a start on Thursday.
        
        
             He had a goal to make 40 percent from deep this year and he basically has it in the bag with his 41.24 percent on the season. DeMarre Carroll (hip) could miss more time, so expect Harris to get more chances to bury treys. He's had a really nice season.

             Capela shot 4-of-6 from the floor and also knocked down three of his four free-throw attempts. He also chipped in one assist, two steals and a block, without turning the ball over. Capela has recorded 41 double-doubles this season, after just 25 in his first three NBA seasons combined. The Rockets are 41-2 when Capela, James Harden and Chris Paul all play together this season.

             He was on fire early with 13 points in the first quarter to get him to his third-best scoring half as a Net with 18 points in the first two quarters. Russell was struggling in a big way over his previous three, so maybe this one gets him going. He's been a letdown overall this season.

             He blocked Giannis Antetokounmpo in the first minute to set the tone, and had a game-sealing swat on Giannis with 21 seconds left -- the scorer may have also shorted him one, too. Allen's shot-blocking prowess is going to make him a very sexy pick in drafts next year, and he's just coming off a 83.3 FT% in March.

Over Golden State's last five games, Young is averaging 5.8 points, 2.4 rebounds and 0.2 assists in 23.2 minutes, while shooting an abysmal 25.7 percent from the floor.

             The Nets were outstanding against Giannis and blocked him a whopping six times in this game. Antetokounmpo's scoring is slightly down since the break and he's not getting to the line as much, so he Bucks will want to get him back on track. The Bucks sit in a tie with the Wizards for the No. 7-8 seeds, so that will be a huge factor in the Greek Freak's playing time in the final week.

Harden has said he would prefer to play out the string, but Houston will likely sit him out one of those nights.

             The Nets were terrific against Jabari with Brooklyn blocking him four times tonight. Parker was coming in fairly hot with efficiency, including his 35-point gem against the Lakers on Sunday, so this was a surprise against what is usually a soft defense. His playing time is soaring with 32, 31 and 35 minutes in his last three, so the minutes limit is a goner.

Unsurspingly, Cook has seen his scoring numbers and shots attempts decrease now that Klay Thompson and Kevin Durant have returned to the Warriors lineup.

             It sounds like we'll be in the dark on this one right until tip. Butler is active, but you would think he would be in the starting lineup if he is going to play. Nemanja Bjelica is listed as the starter for this one. Stay tuned.

            Jeff Teague (knee) will rejoin the Wolves starting lineup Thursday vs. Nuggets
        
        
             Teague ends up missing just one game due to the knee issue. This is an important game for the Wolves, so having their starting PG back in the mix certainly helps. Tyus Jones will be bumped back to the bench.

            Ricky Rubio (hamstring) went to the locker room in the second quarter on Thursday, and he will not return.
        
        
             According to the Jazz broadcast, Rubio had a heat wrap on his hamstring earlier in the game. His hamstring has been bothering him lately and it kept him out of action last month, so there's a very good chance he won't be ready this weekend. Dante Exum has looked terrific, so expect him to pick up some of the slack along with Royce O'Neale.

             Thompson grabbed seven boards but didn't bring much else to the table, finishing with one assist, one steal and one turnover. Klay was also inefficient offensively, shooting just 6-of-16 from the field. However, he did make four his four his nine attempts from behind the arc.

            Brandon Ingram (concussion) was riding a stationary bike on Thursday, but he is out for Friday against the Wolves.
        
        
             That's the first step in the protocol, so it means he could be symptom-free. Perhaps Ingram isn't going to be out for the season and he'll move to the next step in 24 hours, assuming he is still symptom-free.

             Durant was once again asked to shoulder the load offensively on Thursday night. However, his jumper wasn't falling. KD shot 8-of-23 from the field, including just 2-of-10 from 3-point territory. He did, however, clean up at the charity stripe, knocking down all nine of his free-throw attempts. Durant has now scored at least 27 points in each of his last four games. The Warriors are locked into the No. 2 seed out West, so there is some concern coach Steve Kerr may choose to rest KD over one of the Warriors final three contests.

             Another solid all-around effort from Young in another Pacers victory. Indiana is actually the first team to sweep a season series against the Steve Kerr-era Warriors. He rarely posts eye-popping lines, but Young consistent contributes fantasy value on a nightly basis. He ranks 78th overall in nine-category leagues this season.
