            Trevor Ariza scored 15 points with five rebounds, one assist and three triples in 31 minutes vs. the Spurs on Monday.
        
        
             That's more like it. Ariza entered this contest hitting just 1-of-16 from 3-point range in his previous three games, but he found his rhythm tonight and finished 5-of-9 from the field and 3-of-7 from deep. He has early-round upside when his shot is falling, but things can get pretty ugly when it isn't. He gets a matchup with the Clippers on Thursday.

            Eric Gordon returned to the bench with the return of James Harden on Monday and missed all seven of his shots, finishing a 109-93 blowout win over the Spurs with just one point in 23 minutes.
        
        
             Gordon was playing well, scoring between 14 and 29 points in his last six games, but the return of Harden combined with Gordon's shot not falling resulted in fantasy disaster. Gordon should bounce back and have some good games down the stretch, as he was playing well off the bench with Harden in the lineup previously, but with guys like Harden, Chris Paul, Trevor Ariza and Clint Capela doing the heavy lifting in Houston, Gordon has the potential for low-scoring games at any time. Additionally, while tonight was likely just a fluke, owners have to hope this isn't the start of a shooting slump for Gordon.

            James Harden (knee) returned from a one-game absence and hit 6-of-17 shots and 14-of-14 free throws on his way to 28 points in Monday's 109-93 win over the Spurs.
        
        
             The score got out of hand early, so Harden got some valuable rest for his knee down the stretch. He added six rebounds, six assists, two triples and three turnovers, and he may have already won the free throw category for his owners on the first day of the week. The Rockets still have a 2.0 game lead over the Warriors for the top seed out West and Harden is locked in as a top-5 fantasy asset regardless of the format, assuming his knee doesn't act up again.

             Yuck. Gasol has scored a grand total of 14 points in his last three games and had a DNP last Thursday. He's been a fantasy disaster for the last four games for the Spurs, but if they're going to make the playoffs, he's going to have to step up the rest of the way. If the playoffs started tomorrow, the Spurs would be out, so don't be surprised if Gasol plays heavy minutes and starts producing again immediately. Having said that, he's still not the most trustworthy guy, especially playing for Gregg Popovich and dealing with a sore shoulder. But the bottom line is that they need Gasol to start going off if they're going to make the playoffs.

             He finished 7-of-13 from the field and continues to pick up the slack for a Memphis team that has been hit by the injury bug. Andrew Harrison (wrist) still isn't close and who knows when Tyreke Evans (ribs) will be back, so Brooks will continue to provide scoring for his fantasy owners. He's currently having arguably the best stretch of his season, averaging 20.2 points, 2.8 rebounds, 1.2 assists and 2.4 triples over his last five games.

             Gay was the only Spurs' starter in double digits, as Kyle Anderson scored six with an empty line, Pau Gasol had four points and four boards in just 15 minutes, Patty Mills had three points in nine minutes, and Dejounte Murray had seven points, four boards, three assists and a steal in 20 minutes. Even with the Spurs fighting for their playoff lives, Gregg Popovich is still completely unpredictable, and with Kawhi Leonard reportedly returning this week, Gay's value will be iffy going forward. But given the fact that he's one of just a few fully healthy Spurs, Gay should continue to see about 25 minutes a night, with or without Leonard.

             You can see the frustration all over his face and he even heaved up a 3-pointer from nearly halfcourt early in the shot clock. However, he played well for the most part, hitting 8-of-17 shots with seven rebounds, three assists, one steal and one block. The Grizzlies have made it painfully obvious that they are tanking, so Gasol's owners will have to constantly be on the lookout for DNPs.

             The Thunder are hanging in the playoff hunt in the West, but their schedule's about to get very difficult and the Thunder will rely on Westbrook heavily down the stretch. He should be highly motivated to get his 100th triple-double against the lowly Hawks on Tuesday, but the Thunder will likely win that one in a landslide, meaning Westy might not play the fourth quarter. After the Hawks, the Thunder's next 11 games will come against teams in, or just on the brink of, the playoffs. And that's when Westbrook should really take off.

             It's a strange decision for Memphis to go back to their 3-big lineup of Martin, JaMychal Green and Marc Gasol, but Martin's owners aren't complaining because it widens his path to minutes. He's played 29 minutes in three straight games since returning from injury, averaging 14.0 points, 4.0 rebounds, 2.7 assists, 0.7 blocks and 0.7 triples. He's getting the job done for deep-league owners and it helps that the Grizzlies are going to rest Marc Gasol quite a bit.

For a guy who's had trouble scoring in his career, Brewer has looked pretty good since joining the Thunder five games ago. And as long as he's going to continue to start and get 30 minutes a night, he might be worth adding in 12-team leagues. Don't drop a good player for him, but if you're sitting on an injured guy like Dwyane Wade, Brewer might be a suitable replacement.

            Jabari Parker never got it going offensively vs. the Grizzlies on Monday, hitting 3-of-6 shots for six points.
        
        
             The rest of his line wasn't much better with three rebounds, two assists and three turnovers. Parker's minutes are still floating around the lower 20s and he was only averaging 12.2 points, 4.6 rebounds, 2.6 assists and 1.4 treys in his previous five games in March. He'll improve, but he's not a must-own player right now.

             Hield had played at least 27 minutes in his previous 10 games, but Garrett Temple got hot tonight and Hield's shot wasn't falling. He's been all over the place lately, but as long as he's getting close to 30 minutes a night, he's probably worth using in fantasy. Tonight's low minutes were a fluke, so look for him to get closer to 30 minutes against the Heat on Wednesday night.

             Slowing down Giannis Antetokounmpo was the focus of Memphis' game plan, so Middleton found himself wide open for several looks. Not only did he shoot the ball well, but Middleton also grabbed six rebounds with four assists, one steal and a pair of triples in 35 minutes. He's flirting with top-30 value on the season and is off to a great start with two games left on the schedule this week.

             WCS has been back for two games from his back injury and is averaging 10.5 points, 7.5 rebounds, 1.0 steals and 0.5 blocks in them. It looks like he's healthy and good to go for his three remaining games this week, so hopefully you put him into your lineup. We're guessing he'll start over Kosta Koufos in the next one, but it remains to be seen if it happens or not.

             It's impossible to guess if Temple will play well or not on any given night, as he's scored 3, 2, 23, 7 and 15 points in each of his last five games. He's nothing more than a streamer in FDS leagues due to his inconsistency and even then he's a risky play, as he could do nothing or get hot on any given night. He's a gambler's fantasy option, at best, but if you played him tonight, he came through with a solid line.

             The Grizzlies were swarming him every time he got the ball, and Giannis turned the ball over six times and was in foul trouble for most of the night. He eventually salvaged his night with a strong fourth quarter, finishing 7-of-14 from the field and 5-of-7 from the line. He will have two more cupcake matchups this week against the Magic on Wednesday and the Hawks on Saturday.

             Bogdanovic has posted a couple duds recently, but bounced back tonight. He plays three more games this week and if you dropped him into your lineup for the week, he's off to a pretty good start. As long as he can stay healthy, his ceiling is high enough for him to be starting any nights he's playing for the Kings. Just expect some inconsistency along the way, as he had hit just 5-of-28 shots in his previous three games before breaking out of his slump tonight.

             Jennings looked like he lost a step in previous stints with the Wizards and Knicks (related to his Achilles injury), but since then he's been dominating overseas and in the G-League. He looked explosive tonight and had the green light for a team that is ranked 28th in 3-pointers per game, hitting 5-of-9 shots, 3-of-6 triples and all three free throws. It's worth noting that Eric Bledsoe (24 minutes) was in foul trouble and the Grizzlies aren't the most formidable team with 18 straight losses, so there are reasons to be skeptical about this line. With that said, he passed the eye test tonight and should at least be on your radar going forward.

             Fox appears to be healthy again and has played 30 and 34 minutes in his last two games since returning from his back problem. He wasn't great tonight, but the double-double was nice to see and he just missed one with 12 points and nine dimes on Sunday. He should be primed for three more nice games this week and tonight was his third double-double of the season.

The good news is that he does have three more games this week and it's anyone's guess if the Kings will rest WCS in any of them, but the only time Koufos is fully trustworthy is when WCS is resting or injured.

             Adams may have also re-tweaked his left ankle which was the reason he was on the injury report in the first place. The Thunder ruled him out during the fourth quarter of what is surprisingly a close game, so that's a bit concerning. He finished with six points, six rebounds, two assists and two steals. If he misses time, the Thunder will likely play more small ball with Jerami Grant and Patrick Patterson picking up run.

McLemore has been hot in March, averaging 14.6 points, 5.4 rebounds, 2.2 assists, 1.8 steals and 2.0 triples.

             The Grizzlies will go with Kobi Simmons, Dillon Brooks, Jarell Martin, JaMychal Green and Gasol in the first unit, so Ben McLemore will head back to the bench. Gasol is safe to deploy in fantasy leagues tonight, but expect more random DNPs going forward.

             The Rockets have been using a small-ball lineup with Trevor Ariza and P.J. Tucker at the three and four, so this is a matchup move for the Spurs. Gay has only been playing around 20 minutes per game, so he's a risky play in fantasy lineups. Expect to see more of Davis Bertans tonight as well.

             It sounds like the Grizzlies will be relatively healthy up front, but Martin is going to start at small forward next to JaMychal Green and Marc Gasol. He's a low-end streaming option, but some fantasy owners can't be too picky on a four-game Monday.

             Wall was able to get through some 5-on-0 work during Monday's practice, so going 5-on-5 will be the next major step. ""I just want him to keep doing the work that he’s put in,"" Scott Brooks said. ""We just want to make sure we’re never going to put him out there before he’s ready. Whenever he’s ready — whether it’s eight games, one game, no game — if he’s ready to play, he’s ready to play."" The Wizards might want him to get in a few full-contact practices before he gets back out there, so Wall might not play this week.

             It looks like Warren will be back out there following a two-game stint on the sidelines, and considering he wasn't out for very long, he shouldn't be operating with any sort of minutes limit. Check back for official confirmation on his status following Tuesday morning's shootaround.

             Jackson only missed one game with the knee issue, so he should be back out there without a minutes limit on Tuesday, which will result in fewer minutes for Shaquille Harrison, Davon Reed and Troy Daniels. Jackson has been hit-or-miss this season, but he offers enough upside to warrant ownership in deep leagues.

             While Williams is being listed as questionable for Tuesday's game, Phoenix beat reporter Scott Bordow indicated that it's more likely he'll get back to the court for Thursday's game against the Jazz. Williams will be eased into things and is unlikely to establish himself as a fantasy asset this season, but his imminent return isn't great news for Alex Len.

Either way, he's expected to miss ""an unspecified amount of time,"" so he's a cut candidate in most leagues. Terry Rozier is going to be very busy this week with Jaylen Brown (concussion), Kyrie Irving (knee) and Smart all out, so he looks like a solid pickup in most leagues.

             There was really no reason to rush Bazemore back for a handful of games in April, so it makes sense that the Hawks are just shutting him down, and he can be cut across the board in fantasy hoops.

However, if Dennis Schroder (elbow) and Malcolm Delaney (ankle) are unable to play on Tuesday vs. the Thunder, Isaiah Taylor could be logging heavy minutes. Morris belongs on the waiver wire in all leagues.

            Kent Bazemore (right knee bone bruise) will miss at least the next ""several weeks"" of action.
        
        
             The rules out Bazemore for the fantasy playoffs in a lot of leagues, and with no clear return date, he should be sent to the waiver wire in most leagues. Tyler Dorsey will likely be moving into the starting lineup while Bazemore is out, and with averages of 10.5 points, 5.0 boards, 4.5 dimes, 1.5 triples and 1.0 steal per game in his previous two starts this season, he could be worth a speculative add in deep leagues. Taurean Prince will also see an uptick in usage sans Bazemore.

             He's still recovering from the illness that kept him out of Sunday's game, but he does have another two full days to recover ahead of Wednesday's game vs. Washington. Owners can expect to get another few updates in the intervening days leading up to Wednesday's tip, but if Horford is forced to sit, Greg Monroe would be someone to consider in DFS. Stay tuned.

             Gordon went through the contact-practice phase of the NBA concussion protocol on Monday, but the Magic will need to make sure he doesn't show any concussion symptoms at Tuesday's morning shootaround. This sounds promising, but we'll list him as questionable as the Magic begin a 3-game week. If Gordon plays, Mario Hezonja and Jonathan Isaac won't have as much upside.

Brooks added that Wall is progressing in the right direction of taking contact, so it sounds like a return in mid-March is still on the table. For fantasy owners in the playoffs, Wall's return can't come soon enough.

He was able to do some light shooting on the side, but for now he should be considered questionable for Tuesday's game vs. the Jazz. Stanley Johnson (back), James Ennis and Luke Kennard will pick up some run if Bullock can't go, but you can't trust any of those guys in a 10- or 12-team league.

Luke Kornet thrived in the starting lineup on Sunday without Kanter, notching 18 points with four boards, two assists, one block and three triples. Kyle O'Quinn was also productive with eight points, seven rebounds, five assists and three blocks.

            Dorian Finney-Smith (knee) is probable for Tuesday's game vs. the Knicks.
        
        
             Finney-Smith made his first appearance since Nov. 12 on Saturday vs. the Grizzlies, but the Mavericks rested him the following night. He'll likely have restrictions again on Tuesday, but might pick up a few extra minutes with Wes Matthews (leg) not on the trip. DFS is only worth monitoring in the deepest of leagues.

             Mejri hasn't played more than six minutes in a game this month, so his status is irrelevant for most fantasy owners. Dwight Powell and Nerlens Noel are comfortably ahead of him on the depth chart.

To his credit, he plays within himself, but there’s going to be some growing pains that come along with that. I was just happy with the spirit that he played with (on Friday)."" While the rookie is still looking for his rhythm on offense, his defense has been terrific and he has per-36 minute averages of 2.0 steals and 2.1 blocks.

             ""You never know a guy until you coach a guy. When we got him, we looked at him as an energy guy, a guy that can play defense,"" Rivers said. ""That’s what he did everywhere he’s been. And then every practice he gets in, he keeps scoring. And scoring. And then we started thinking, ‘Maybe he can score a little bit.’ He’s been better than that. He’s been great."" Harrell has been a scoring machine and is fourth in the NBA in true shooting percentage, behind only Stephen Curry, DeAndre Jordan, and Clint Capela. He's averaging 16.2 points, 4.2 rebounds, 1.2 assists and 1.0 blocks over his last 10 games and the Clippers play four times in each of the next three weeks, making him a solid pickup.

""It’s aching a little bit more than I wanted it to now, so I’m taking the necessary time."" He had surgery on his left knee two years ago and Celtics GM Danny Ainge recently said that this is something he will have to manage the rest of his career. Boston is sitting in second place in the East, so they aren't going to take any chances, but it's worth noting that Adrian Wojnarowski reports the Celtics are confident Irving won't need to miss ""significant time."" Terry Rozier is worth a speculative add in most leagues.

Through six March games he's averaging 12.7 points, 6.8 rebounds, 2.3 assists, 1.7 steals and 1.5 triples.

Bam Adebayo got into some foul trouble in his last start, but he and Kelly Olynyk are both strong streaming options on a four-game slate. Adebayo had six points, eight rebounds and one assist, while Olynyk had 13 points, 11 rebounds, two assists, one steal and two blocks vs. the Wizards.

             The Cavs were missing Rodney Hood (back) and Cedi Osman (hip) tonight, which forced coach Ty Lue to go with a small lineup featuring Green at SF and LeBron at PF. ""If we're small, I don't see how [we can prevent offensive rebounds],"" Lue said before the game. ""We just gotta continue to keep boxing out and we gotta gang rebound."" The Cavs were crushed 51-37 on the glass anyway, and Green is too inconsistent to own even if he earns more starts.

            John Holland was a rare bright spot for Cleveland on Sunday, coming off the bench for nine points, three rebounds, two assists, one steal and two 3-pointers in 19 minutes.
        
        
             The Cavs recently brought Holland up from the G League on a two-way deal, and he took advantage of a dire injury situation tonight -- it helped that extra minutes were available in garbage time. ""We've got confidence in him,"" coach Tyronn Lue said before the game. ""Young, good player and [injuries to Cedi Osman and Rodney Hood] will give him a chance to play."" As long as Hood is day-to-day, though, there's no reason to think Holland will be worth owning.

             Rodney Hood (back) was out tonight and the Cavs needed their supporting cast to help LeBron James, but he was mostly on an island. J.R. Smith shot 1-of-7 from the field, Jeff Green shot 2-of-8 as a fill-in starter, and the result was a 127-113 road loss. Clarkson is better most nights but doesn't offer much beyond scoring and some 3-pointers.

             Lakers coach Luke Walton said afterward, ""[Randle] was pretty special ... The crazy thing is, I still think he can be better."" Randle feasted against the Cavs' decimated frontcourt tonight, but that doesn't undermine what he's done over the past dozen games with averages of 21.3 points (60.7% FGs, 75.0% FTs), 9.2 rebounds, 4.3 assists, 0.9 steals and 0.7 blocks. Best of all, he's a monster for owners in both category- and points-based leagues.

             One challenge with Lonzo and Isaiah Thomas in the same backcourt is that neither guy has shot well near the rim this season -- Ball is just 45.5% within five feet, dead last among qualifying players, while Thomas' 48.8% is third-worst. Ball is also a combined 2-of-14 from deep in his past two games -- throw in high turnovers and awful FT shooting (48.2%), and it's obvious why he's far more appealing in points-based fantasy systems.

             BroLo came in averaging 28.0 points over his past two games, so this wasn't simply the result of facing a Cavs team without Tristan Thompson and Kevin Love. Lopez's play has spiked recently due to a variety of factors, including Brandon Ingram's (groin) absence and Lonzo Ball getting healthy, but playing time is the key -- after hitting a low of 17.1 minutes per game in January, he's up to 28.0 per game in March. It's a fortuitous turn of events for patient fantasy owners, so enjoy the elite production while it lasts.

             IT opened the game 0-of-4 from the field but soon found his rhythm, finishing 7-of-16 from the field and 4-of-4 from the line. He scored 14 of his points in the second half as L.A. built a commanding lead en route to a 127-113 victory, which must have been satisfying after his disastrous stint in Cleveland. Thomas is poison for FG%, but his weighted-FT% is great and he's getting enough assists, points and 3-pointers to make up the difference.

             Brandon Ingram (strained groin) has been ruled out for back-to-back games on Tuesday and Wednesday, which ensures added minutes and usage for guys like KCP and Kyle Kuzma (14 points, 10 boards in 39 minutes). Caldwell-Pope hasn't fallen below 36 minutes in any of the Lakers' past six games, which is ridiculous, and he's peaking at an ideal moment for fantasy owners.

             Before the game, Nets coach Kenny Atkinson said it’s taken Crabbe a while to adjust to being an every-night starter in the Nets' system. He was surging in February but has been all over the place in March -- he scored an efficient 29 points last Thursday, but is a combined 29.6% from the field in the other four games. Feel free to roll with him if you need points and triples, with a handful of boards and steals, but don't be surprised if he tanks your FG%.

             Okafor hadn't played since Feb. 12 and maybe coach Kenny Atkinson wanted to give him the satisfaction of playing against Philly.

             This was a forgettable game all-around for the Nets, who were trounced 120-97 on their home court. It wasn't all bad news for Carroll's owners -- prior to the game, coach Kenny Atkinson confirmed that he likes Rondae Hollis-Jefferson and Caris LeVert coming off the bench, which should ensure that Carroll keeps his current starting job.

In Brooklyn's previous six games he was averaging 11.2 points and 1.8 triples in 24.2 minutes, but added a mere 3.8 rebounds, 1.3 assists, 0.2 steals and 0.2 blocks. The lack of supporting stats is why you'll find him on the vast majority of waiver wires.

             Not good. This is four straight games in which Allen has logged 21 minutes or less, but at least tonight's quiet line wasn't due to foul trouble (two personals) or silly turnovers (zero). He doesn't hurt you anywhere, which allows him to post top-100 roto value even when his minutes are held in check. With the Nets incentivized to develop their young guys, limited minutes shouldn't be an issue much longer.

His efforts helped Philly score 70 points in the first half for the fifth time this season, and the win pulled them within a game of the No. 5 seed Wizards. Fantasy owners have to be pleased with Saric's production, which hasn't declined since Ersan Ilyasova joined the rotation.

            T.J. McConnell had 10 points, six assists, four rebounds and a game-high four steals in 29 minutes vs. the Nets on Sunday.
        
        
             McConnell made 5-of-9 shots without attempting any free throws or 3-pointers. The steals highlight his fantasy cache for category-based owners. With 2.7 steals per 48 minutes, McConnell ranks 11th among qualifying players, behind guys like Victor Oladipo, Chris Paul, Eric Bledsoe, Paul George and Kris Dunn.

            Ersan Ilyasova tied his season-high with 13 rebounds on Sunday, adding 11 points on 5-of-10 shooting, one rebound and three steals.
        
        
             The steals were one shy of Ilyasova's season-high and he didn't commit any turnovers in 27 minutes. That's the most he's played since joining Philly, and it could have been higher if not for foul trouble (five personal fouls) and the lopsided score (120-97). He has the green-light to shoot 3-pointers but doesn't contribute enough elsewhere to be worth owning in 12-team leagues, at least while Dario Saric is healthy.

             We got the 'good' Covington tonight after seeing the flipside of the coin in an 0-of-10 stinker vs. Miami on Thursday. The asterisk is that he blew up against the Nets' lousy defense tonight (23rd in defensive rating), but fantasy owners will take what they can get. Philly's upcoming matchups are also very promising -- after hosting the Pacers on Tuesday, they get the Knicks, Nets, Hornets, Grizzlies and Magic.

             Larkin was 0-of-4 from the field, including 0-of-2 from behind the 3-point line. He continues to be under a minute restriction of 15-20 minutes due to his knee, but he is hopeful of lending a bigger hand with Jaylen Brown (concussion) out. He said he felt tightness with some fluid in his knee when out, but was able to take care of it with rest. Head coach Brad Stevens said Brown could miss a week with his concussion. If Larkin wants to see more run he'll need to shoot a lot better than this.

             Fatigue has been a consistent refrain when explaining Embiid's recent dip in production, including three straight games under 20 points and 41.0 percent shooting in March. Philly was able to keep his minutes in check thanks to an easy win at Brooklyn tonight, which should ensure that Embiid is rested and ready for an important game vs. the Pacers on Tuesday.

            Terry Rozier finished with 16 points in 34 minutes off the bench in Sunday's 99-97 loss against Indiana.
        
        
             Rozier was thrust into a larger role with Kyrie Irving checking back out early due to soreness in his knee. He has scored in double figures in a career-high 16 straight games dating back to Jan. 31, and the last 13 games of the streak have come as a reserve. With Irving ailing yet again, it might be a big week for Rozier if the team decides to play it safe with their All-Star point guard. If Irving is out, Rozier could be in line for a big game against Washington on Wednesday.

             Morris was making the start with Al Horford under the weather. It's likely a one-off, as the team has two full days off before taking the court again on Wednesday against the Wizards, so look for Morris to be back to the bench to kick off the three-game week.

             Smart hit 6-of-12 from behind the arc, finishing with 20 points, eight assists, seven rebounds and four steals across 36 minutes. The jammed thumb appeared to be pretty bad at the time, but he just shook it off and was able to finish up without any issues. He'll have a couple of days to rest his thumb before the team hosts the Wizards on Wednesday to start off a three-game week. Kyrie Irving left the game with a sore left knee, so Smart could see more run Wednesday if he is up to it.

             Collison is the first player on the Pacers to have at least 10 assists coming off the bench since Earl Watson accomplished the feat on Dec. 12, 2009. After an 11-game absence, Collison is slowly working his way back into shape. While he didn't do anything on the offensive end, the assists were nice. It appears he is good to go for the fantasy playoffs, and the Pacers will kick off a three-game week in Philly on Tuesday.

             Sabonis suffered a cut over his left eye but he was able to return and finish the game. After a couple of subpar outings, Sabonis seemed to have a fire lit under him after the injury. He entered 5-of-15 from the floor over the past two outings, but went an efficient 5-of-9 in this one. If you normally rely upon him in deeper fantasy leagues it appears he'll be just fine Tuesday in Philly to start a three-game week.

             Ingram was initially expected to be evaluated on Monday, so this is a minor setback for owners -- and it's discouraging that he's been ruled out for multiple games days in advance. Guys like Kyle Kuzma, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope and Julius Randle will continue to pick up the slack until Ingram returns, and L.A. has also been relying on Brook Lopez for an increased share of the offense. It makes sense to hold him until Thursday's evaluation, but that might not be feasible if there's a fantasy playoff on the line.

That's three outstanding games in a row, averaging 20.0 points, 8.7 rebounds and 2.3 blocked shots per game across the past three while dropping in seven triples. He'll look to keep it going Tuesday in Philadelphia to tip off a three-game week.

            Kyrie Irving (sore left knee) said after Sunday's game that his knee has been ""achy"" for the past week, and admitted that he might need time to rest.
        
        
             Irving added that he's ""not concerned"" about his injury long-term, but there's no urgency for him to play with Boston seven games up on Cleveland for the No. 2 seed. It sounds like he'll miss a few games to fully recover, but owners should obviously check for updates on Monday before locking in weekly lineups. If he does miss more games, it will primarily benefit Terry Rozier and Marcus Smart.

             DSJ wound up missing just one game with his knee injury, which is a relief with fantasy playoffs looming. The rookie's inefficiency has taken a huge toll in most formats, though, due largely to struggles beyond the arc (30.7% from deep), which is something we'll watch closely this offseason. For now, owners can at least anticipate solid counting stats while he's turned loose over the Mavs' final 15 games.

             Ferrell continues to get heavy playing time whether he's starting or coming off the bench, but his path to playing time would be easier if Matthews misses any games this week. The Mavs announced that Matthews will have an MRI on Monday, so anyone considering Yogi should keep an eye on the injury report. Just be aware that Dallas has a rather poor schedule with games on Tuesday, Friday and Saturday in Week 22.

             The former lottery pick came in averaging 15.0 points and 2.0 triples on 57.7% shooting in his previous three games. That wasn't sustainable, but we were still hoping for more with Wes Matthews (leg) getting ruled out late tonight. McDermott added three rebounds and one assist with two turnovers tonight, and it's worth noting that Dallas plays just three games in each of the next two weeks.

             Noel was rested on Saturday as a precaution but this is the second straight game he's put up impressive numbers -- he had eight points, 14 boards, one steal and one block in 26 minutes on Tuesday. His minutes are unlikely to spike while Dwight Powell is playing well, especially since Dallas seems content to keep Dirk Nowitzki on the court, but few big men have as much raw upside as Noel. If you need boards and defensive stats, you could do worse.

             Mike D'Antoni confirmed before the game that Harden will return on Monday, so this doesn't have lasting implications for Gordon's fantasy value. He came in shooting 41.2% from the field in Houston's previous three games, but that included 15.3 points, 3.3 triples, 4.0 rebounds, 0.7 steals, 1.0 blocks and a perfect mark at the FT line. He's at his best when Harden or Chris Paul are out of the lineup, but is basically a lock for standard-league value regardless.

            Kyrie Irving (left knee soreness) will not return to Sunday's game.
        
        
             Irving stayed in the locker room after halftime, with Terry Rozier taking his spot in the starting lineup. This is the same ailment that forced him to sit out Monday's game vs. the Bulls, but he said after tonight's game that he's ""not concerned"" about the injury long-term. Rozier, Marcus Smart and Shane Larkin all get a boost if he misses more games, but owners should wait for clarification before making a pickup in most situations.

             Barton was back to the pine after Wilson Chandler (hip) returned from a one-game absence. It was a decent performance for Barton, as he ended up 3-of-5 from the field with six rebounds, four assists and just one turnover. His minutes were down a little because of the lopsided nature of the game, and not really anything he did on the court. Even coming off the bench he is a solid fantasy option across most formats.

             Harris hit 9-of-16 from the field, including 2-of-9 from behind the 3-point line, and he also was 1-of-1 from the free-throw line while posting a plus-27 rating in the laugher. It was a much better outing for Harris and all of the Nuggets against the Kings after the team drew criticism from head coach Michael Malone after a Jan. 6 loss in Sacramento. The coach called that loss one of the team's worst performances of the season.

             Murray also added five assists and three rebounds, and more importantly he didn't draw the ire of the opposing coach. He drew harsh criticism from Lakers head coach Luke Walton for ""disrespectful"" behavior down the stretch in Friday's home game against L.A. As luck has it, the Nuggets meet the Lakers at Staples Center on Tuesday night to kick off a three-game week, so it will be interesting to see how the Blue Arrow responds.

             Chandler looked good, playing 26 minutes while going a very effective 6-of-9 from the field, including 2-of-3 from behind the 3-point line. He was returning from a one-game absence after having an injection in his hip, but didn't appear to play with any type of restrictions. He did catch extra rest for longer periods in the second half with the game mostly out of hand, but owners can expect to have him for all of Denver's games next week.

             Jokic recorded his seventh triple-double of the season and the 13th of his career. The team is also 6-1 in his triple-doubles this season, winning each of the past six since dropping a 124-114 decision in his first one back on Jan. 8. He was a very efficient 8-of-10 from the field, including 4-of-4 from behind the 3-point line, and he rolled up a game-high plus-33 rating, too. The Nuggets are back at it on the road Tuesday against the Lakers to tip off a three-game week.

His performance was like night and day after a nightmare 0-of-8 shooting night on Friday against Orlando. He is a decent fantasy option in plenty of leagues heading into the upcoming four-game week starting Monday in Oklahoma City.

             While he didn't start, the playing time is a good sign that Cauley-Stain's lower back strain is in the rear-view mirror. He finished with 12 points, eight rebounds, three assists and a steal while going 4-of-11 from the field. WCS said before the game he feels ""great"" but was concerned about his lungs since he hadn't played since March 1 and this game was at high elevation. He passed that test with flying colors. If you normally rely on him it looks safe to plug him back into active lineups, although he is a question mark with the back-to-back situation on Monday in Oklahoma City. The Kings have four games on tap in the upcoming week, so he should log plenty of stats either way.

             Mirotic has been seriously struggling with his jumper over the past two games, connecting on just 10.0% of his shot attempts and he hasn't connected on a single triple over that two-game span. Random cold streaks are nothing new to Mirotic, however, so it should only be a matter of time until he busts out of the funk.

             Koufos was sharp from the field, going 7-of-10, but he did end up a minus-24 as the Nuggets really started pouring it on in the third quarter. That's three pretty strong games in a row from the big man, as he is averaging 12.7 points and 11.0 rebounds per game during the stretch. He has a four-game week starting Monday and is a decent play in deeper formats while running hot.

             Fox was 4-of-9 from the field but 0-of-2 from behind the 3-point line. He didn't appear to be hampered by his back ailment, and he tied Willie Cauley-Stein for the team high in minutes played. The Kings will have a quick turnaround, playing Monday in Oklahoma City, but there hasn't been any mention of Fox being limited in the back-to-back situation. Sacramento has three additional games in the upcoming week anyway.

             Crowder operated almost entirely behind the arc offensively, which is part of the reason he shot so poorly. This comes on the heels of a 7-of-12 shooting performance (with six 3-pointers), however, and his true production lies somewhere in the middle of those extremes. He got some time alongside Derrick Favors tonight and coach Quin Snyder seems to love him, so don't sleep on Crowder if you're looking for a free agent forward.

             Z-Bo has been seeing DNP-CDs on a fairly routine basis this season, as head coach Dave Joerger and the Kings organization lean upon their younger players more, evaluating what they have for the future. Randolph, an aging veteran, is obviously not part of the team's long-term plans. When he plays, he still has a little left in the tank, but it's tough to trust him for fantasy purposes at this point.

             Davis tied his season-high in swats (six) before the first half ended, which tied a franchise record (held by Davis) for the most blocks in a half, and his 10 blocks not only set a personal best but also set the new franchise record for most swats in a single game. This was the first points-boards-blocks triple-double since Hassan Whiteside did it back in 2016, and AD is just the second player in NBA history to amass 9,000 points and 9,000 swats prior to turning 25. The other guy? Shaquille O'Neal. He did, however, exit the game during the closing minutes, but maybe he was just gassed after going wild on his birthday.

The four made 3-pointers were also his highest since late October. Rubio has reclaimed some offensive rhythm since returning from a hip injury, and is once again posting top-50 value at an ideal time for fantasy owners.

             Holiday also added six rebounds, three triples, two steals, one block and four turnovers through 39 minutes of floor time, and while the end result was a loss for the Pelicans, this was a solid bounce-back performance from Jrue following Friday's four-point disaster against the Wizards. This was Holiday's 66th game of the season, which triggered a $255K bonus in his contract, and he's on pace to play in the most games he has since the 2012-13 season.

             Rondo had a tough time staying in front of Ricky Rubio, which is why his minutes were low, and the no defensive stats were a bummer. Rondo isn't really a difference maker in fantasy hoops, but he's at least worth owning as a dimes specialist if you're okay with some lame free throw shooting.

Over the past six games sans Butler, Wiggins' usage rate has risen to 26.4 and he's responded with averages of 21.5 points, 3.8 boards, 2.0 triples, 2.5 dimes and 2.5 turnovers per game on 45.9% shooting from the field and 68.0% from the line.

             Rose got into the game for a short three-minute stint during the first quarter and had another brief four-minute stint during the second period of action, but he didn't touch the floor at all during the second half with the game being close. It's unlikely he'll be a major part of the rotation with the Timberwolves, so he can safely remain on the waiver wire in all leagues.

             Dorsey missed his first six shots and finished 1-of-7 from deep, so his line could have looked a lot better. Bazemore (right knee sprain) and Jaylen Morris (left ankle) didn't return after early injuries today, and DeAndre Bembry (groin) is already out indefinitely, which at least gives Dorsey a chance to carve out fantasy value. For now, though, most owners can watch him from a safe distance.

             This was a dream matchup vs. a terrible Bulls defense, and exaggerated stats were abundant. The rebounds and assists were season-highs, and Muscala's five 3-pointers were also a career-high, so congratulations to the handful of owners who deployed him on Sunday. We're not expecting a repeat performance, at least while Dewayne Dedmon and John Collins are healthy.

Magette earned backup PG minutes and would be worth a look if guys like Schroder, Delaney and Morris miss more time, but that's not a given. Just put him on your radar in deep leagues.

Despite his tendency for random duds, he's a must-own asset with Atlanta developing young guys down the stretch.

             Teague took a backseat to the Andrew Wiggins and Karl-Anthony Towns show in this one, and he also expended a lot of energy chasing around the Golden State guys on defense. He should be more involved in the offense his next time out, and it's worth pointing out that despite Derrick Rose making his Wolves debut today, Teague's minutes were unaffected. It doesn't seem like Rose's arrival will impact Teague at all.

            Kevin Durant scored 39 points on 11-of-32 shooting in Sunday’s 109-103 loss to the Timberwolves, adding 12 boards, five 3-pointers, four assists, three blocks and two turnovers in 39 minutes.
        
        
             Durant was ultra-aggressive in this one putting up his most shot attempts since donning a Dubs' jersey, but Minnesota did an excellent job of loading up on him whenever he touched the ball, consistently forcing him to settle for tightly contested jumpers. While his efficiency has dipped since Stephen Curry (ankle) hit the sidelines, he's been a monster with the counting stats posting averages of 39.5 points, 5.5 triples, 9.0 boards, 5.0 dimes, 2.5 swats and 3.5 turnovers per game over the past two.

             While Cook will likely continue to start for however long Stephen Curry (ankle) is out, he really hasn’t done much since entering the starting five, posting averages of 6.0 points, 2.5 rebounds, 1.0 assist and 1.5 turnovers over the past two. His hand is fine, but he’s not worth owning anywhere.

             This was actually a step in the right direction for Nwaba, who was held to two points in the first half before finding his offense. He's played 24 or fewer minutes in three straight games, however, which is reason enough to look elsewhere for a hot free agent.

             Portis struggled on Friday with two points on 1-of-10 shooting, but he rewarded faithful owners with a big line today. He's tied his career-high with five assists in  back-to-back games, which is another interesting wrinkle. We're not expecting that trend to continue, but he's still a worthy play in the Bulls' upcoming three-game week.

             Lopez played the entire first quarter but was benched the rest of the way, as coach Fred Hoiberg opted for more Bobby Portis (27 minutes) and Noah Vonleh (19 minutes). The NBA front office chastised the Bulls for resting healthy players, which could lead to more half-hearted starts for Lopez, but he's obviously not a trustworthy fantasy option.

""Just a little rest ... make sure he's ready for the next game,"" coach Mike D'Antoni said. Eric Gordon will step into the starting role and Harden's usage will be absorbed by a committee that includes Gordon, Chris Paul and Trevor Ariza.

            Troy Williams saw just six minutes off the bench in Sunday's blowout loss to the Raptors, finishing with three points, two rebounds, two steals and one assist.
        
        
             Williams popped off for a season-high 18 minutes in 26 minutes off the bench on Friday, but he didn't even get into the game until garbage time today, which isn't great for his rest-of-season outlook considering the game was a massive blowout and Lance Thomas (thumb) was unavailable. He's too inconsistent to trust in most settings.

             The Knicks were horrendous on the defensive end in this one, conceding a season-high 132 points from Toronto while allowing the Raptors to shoot 50% from the field and 46% from 3-point range. New York has now dropped seven straight, they're 1-15 over their past 16 outings, and their 43 losses on the season has them tied with Chicago for the eighth-worst record in the league.

            Kent Bazemore (sprained right knee) will not return on Sunday.
        
        
             Bazemore landed awkwardly and immediately limped into the locker room. The Hawks have already rested him as a precaution this season, so owners should prepare for some possible DNPs -- Atlanta plays three games this week on Tuesday (vs. OKC), Thursday (vs. CHA) and Saturday (at MIL). If he does miss time, Tyler Dorsey could absorb the bulk of his playing time. Until the Hawks update Bazemore's status, though, most owners should just hold tight.

            Luke Kornet came through with a career-high 18 points on 7-of-15 shooting Sunday, to go with three 3-pointers, four rebounds, two assists, one block and one turnover in 34 minutes.
        
        
             Kornet got the start with Enes Kanter dealing with back spasms, and while he has played well when given the minutes this season, Kanter’s injury doesn’t seem serious so Kornet could return to being a negligible part of the rotation on Tuesday against the Mavericks. He's someone to monitor in deep leagues, but we'd like to see a repeat performance and a timetable on Kanter before recommending him as an add in most settings.

             Beasley did a nice job on the boards, but he failed to take advantage of the increased opportunity on offense with Enes Kanter (back) watching from the sidelines, instead deferring to Tim Hardaway Jr. and Luke Kornet. Beasley doesn’t often contribute much in the way of defensive statistics, has efficiency issues and struggles in the turnover department, so he’s simply not worth the headache in most leagues.

             Mudiay’s relatively efficient outing was particularly impressive coming against the No. 3 ranked team in terms of defensive efficiency, and he also did a nice job of containing Kyle Lowry on the other end of the floor. He should close out the year as New York’s starting point guard, but he’s too inconsistent to trust in 12-team leagues with just 13 roster spots.

             Poeltl really isn't anything more than a defensive specialist in deep leagues, so when he fails to bring any defensive statistics to the box score, he's really not doing much for his owners.

Isaiah Taylor should be very busy as the starting PG, and Josh Maggette should absorb playing time as his primary backup on Sunday.

             Davis makes everyone around him better, so while Mirotic won't be starting today, we'd expect a bit of a bounce-back performance from Friday as Davis' gravity gives him more room to operate.

            Anthony Davis (ankle) will return to the starting lineup for Sunday's game against the Jazz, sending Nikola Mirotic back to the bench.
        
        
             Davis will be back out there following a one-game stint on the sidelines, and Alvin Gentry said he'll be without a minutes limit, so owners shouldn't hesitate to get him active. Mirotic tends to get his minutes regardless of how he enters the game, so the demotion to the second unit won't have much of an impact on his fantasy value.

             Taylor will make his first career start alongside Kent Bazemore, Taurean Prince, John Collins and Dewayne Dedmon. There's a good chance the Hawks are just resting Schroder to improve their draft lottery odds, but Taylor is a fine streaming option if you need a bump in assists. Coach Mike Budenholzer indicated that Josh Magette will get some run and that we could also see some no-PG lineups with Kent Bazemore, Tyler Dorsey or Jaylen Morris running the offense. On a side note, Taylor's ankle is fine after tweaking it on Friday.

             Your move, Chicago. The Hawks are racing several teams to the bottom of the standings to improve their lottery position and the Bulls are one of those teams, so this was pretty easy to see coming. Isaiah Taylor will draw the start and we could see Josh Magette, Tyler Dorsey and Jaylen Morris pick up some extra run with Malcolm Delaney (ankle) also out.

             The Cavaliers were already going to be shorthanded without Rodney Hood (back) and Cedi Osman (hip), so losing Korver on the wings would be a huge blow.

             Johnson has missed two games in a row with back spasms, but it sounds like he should be ready in time for Tuesday's game vs. the Jazz. Reggie Bullock is rolling and James Ennis played really well in Johnson's absence, so it will be interesting to see what coach Stan Van Gundy's rotation will look like. Johnson isn't a great pickup.

Kornet turned some heads back on Feb. 8 (also against the Raptors) when he scored 11 points with 10 rebounds, four blocks and three triples, so he's an interesting name to watch down the stretch for the rebuilding Knicks. Expect Michael Beasley and Kyle O'Quinn to pick up some of Kanter's slack as well.

             Jackson did some non-contact stuff at Sunday's practice and is finally on track to play at some point during this 6-game, 12-day road trip. He hasn't been a full participant in practice yet, so if he does play it will be probably be towards the end of the trip. Jackson will have heavy restrictions upon his return, so he's just a low-end pickup if you have a bye week in the fantasy playoffs or an I.R. spot.

             He was a little banged up after taking a knee the midsection, but it's not clear if this related. Either way, Kanter has missed time this season because of his back and it's not a surprise to see the Knicks play it safe. Michael Beasley and Kyle O'Quinn should hold down the fort up front, and we may get a look at rookie Luke Kornet as well. Beasley looks like a strong play and KOQ has been solid lately with nine total blocks in his last three games.

             The Knicks just placed him on the injury report less than an hour ago with a questionable tag, and he's day-to-day after X-rays came back negative. Michael Beasley will likely see a bump in minutes and is a boom-or-bust fantasy option, while Troy Williams is worth watching closely after his strong game vs. the Bucks.

             Both players were listed as doubtful, so fantasy owners saw this coming. Wright's toe has been an issue for nearly a week and it sounds like he could miss additional time. Fred VanVleet will continue to step up and has played at least 23 minutes in six straight outings, averaging 9.5 points, 3.3 rebounds, 3.8 assists, 1.3 steals and 1.2 triples.

This may explain why he has cooled off, as Burke has scored a combined eight points on 4-of-18 shooting in his last two games.

He had eight points, a season-high 14 rebounds, one steal and a block in 26 minutes in his last game, so he'll be a hot pickup if he can post similar numbers vs. Houston because of his upside in defensive stats.

             This is the same knee that had the ACL tear and he also had some swelling earlier this season. The Mavs continue to say that DSJ sat on Saturday as a precaution, but this is a little worrying with the Mavs playing for lottery balls. As for Sunday, it looks like it's safe to pencil him into lineups. Yogi Ferrell and J.J. Barea will lose some value if DSJ is cleared.

             Harris hit 8-of-15 from the field, including 1-of-3 from behind the 3-point line, while adding 4-of-5 from the free-throw line against his former team. He also added nine rebounds with two assists, a steal and a blocked shot. The only thing fantasy owners could complain about would be his streak of two or more 3-pointers coming to an end, and he turned the ball over four times, too.

             It was a weird night for Jordan, as he was just 2-of-5 from the field, but he was actually NBA-caliber from the free-throw with a 5-of-6 night. Facing Nikola Vucevic had a lot to do with his struggles at the offensive end. He continues to clean the glass at a furious rate, grabbing 15 or more rebounds in each of his past six outings, including three 20-plus efforts.

He also posted a plus-19 rating which was easily best on the team. Teodosic saw plenty of minutes with starter Sindarius Thornwell spending most of his night on the bench due to the referee's whistle.

             Thornwell was efficient in his brief time on the floor, hitting 2-of-2 from the floor and 2-of-2 from the free-throw line. However, he picked up four personal fouls to thwart what could have been a huge stat line. If he continues to start he might be a decent addition for those in deeper fantasy formats, especially with the Clippers in line for four games next week.

             Williams hit 10-of-22 from the field, including 3-of-6 from behind the 3-point line, while adding two rebounds and a steal. He saved his best for last, as he dumped in 10 points in the fourth quarter. Williams leads the NBA in fourth-quarter scoring. Regardless of his role in the lineup, Williams continues to be a major asset to fantasy players.

             Birch went 1-of-3 from the field while adding three rebounds, one steal and just one turnover. The most noteworthy part of his game was the fact he saw some time at power forward in addition to center. After disappearing for eight games, he is averaging 15.0 minutes per game over the past two outings. Perhaps his versatility will score him some addition run down the stretch, but he is only a player worth monitoring in deeper fantasy leagues at this point.

             Mack was a very efficient 6-of-11 from the floor, including 2-of-3 from the field, while adding three assists and a steal. His playing time will come and go depending on the lineups the Magic roll out. When they use no-PG lineups, it's obviously bad news for Mack, D.J. Augustin, etc. The 16 points were his most since Feb. 10, and this was just his third game with 10 or more points in the past 12 outings. He's a decent guy to stream or use in deeper leagues.

He's probably more of a 14-team guy now, but don't be shocked if he's a strong add sooner rather than later.

He should face less defensive pressure against the Kings on Monday night.

             He continues to do it for his fantasy owners and he's been hot for 14 games now. In that span, Powell averaged 13.0 points, 8.6 boards, 1.9 dimes, 0.9 steals, 0.4 blocks and 1.0 turnovers on 61.3 percent from the field. That gives him fifth-round value per game in standard leagues, so he's been tremendous for his savvy fantasy owners.

             The best part of this is he made 10-of-11 from the line. Barnes was also getting into the paint and he's really found himself as a scorer again. Over his last five, he's averaged 22.0 points, 6.4 boards, 2.6 assists and 1.2 treys. Harry B could keep it going and he gets Houston on Sunday.

Encouraging notes aside, McBuckets just doesn't do enough on the stat sheet to be counted on in fantasy.

             Anthony hit just 1-of-8 from the field, including 0-of-3 from behind the 3-point line. He added seven rebounds, two assists, a steal and a blocked shot, but he also had two turnovers and a minus-13 rating in the ugly outing. Fantasy owners expect much more from 'Melo, not just a measly deuce in the scoring column. He'll look to get untracked against the Kings on Monday.

             He helped the Mavs get an easy win with a lot of easy shots tonight. Dennis Smith Jr. (knee) didn't play, so that definitely helped. If you look at per-minute stats, Barea per-36 averages of 17.9 points, 4.9 boards, 10.4 dimes and 2.5 treys when he's not with DSJ. Barea should be owned in most leagues in competitive leagues.

             Head coach Billy Donovan didn't have any updates on Adams after the big man turned his ankle after landing on Dejounte Murray's foot. If Adams is unable to play in Monday's game against Sacramento, look for Patrick Patterson and Nick Collison to pick up some extra run. The team might even reach down to the G-League and summon Dakari Johnson for big man reinforcements.

             It was a topsy-turvy night for San Antonio, as just one starter was in double digits and three bench players connected for 10 or more points. Gay was the most consistent scoring threat, hitting 7-of-14 from the floor while adding six rebounds with an assist and no turnovers. He remains useful in most fantasy leagues, but his ceiling is rather limited as long as LaMarcus Aldridge is healthy.

The Spurs were not hitting on all cylinders, and just one starter ended up in double digits as far as scoring. Despite the off game he remains a useful fantasy option heading into the new week, particularly in head-to-head formats since the Spurs have four games on tap.

            Jarell Martin scored 13 points with three rebounds, three assists and one 3-pointer in 29 minutes against the Mavs on Saturday.
        
        
             He would have played even more had the Grizzlies not been out of it in the third quarter. Martin's position flexibility has really helped him get run and he did play 30 minutes on Friday after missing two games. He won't be a difference maker, but Martin is worth a look in standard leagues.

             That's kind of a letdown and he has looked a step slow since his ankle tweak. It wasn't minor either because he was in a walking boot. Either way, you're not counting on Deyonta.

             He did not start the second half, but he still saw big minutes because of garbage time. Simmons is going to get some competition for minutes at some point because you'd think at least one of the 1,604 injured PGs on the Grizzlies could get healthy this week. He's more of a drop than an add.

             ""These things suck,"" he said. Maybe he pulled his muscle on the last play of the third quarter, but either way this is rough news. His fantasy owners may not want to wait this out, so dropping him is probably the move. Wayne Ellington, Tyler Johnson and Justise Winslow gain some value.

             He completely dominated on both ends of the floor, and the Heat went off in the fourth with a season-high 43 points in the third quarter. Johnson also benefitted from Hassan Whiteside (hip) missing this game, and Johnson's minutes were hanging around 20 before the injury. He's more of a lukewarm hold and will have some bad games mixed in.

             On the last Miami shot of the game, Winslow drove to the basket and fell after banged knees. He went to the locker room at the end of the game with about 10 seconds left on the clock, so it's not a big deal. Coach Erik Spoelstra said that Winslow is going to be OK, though. Winslow's stat line was pretty boring in the first three quarters, but garbage time helped. He'll be trending down, but keep rolling him out there unless there's a hot free agent you have to have.

             The Heat had eight garbage minutes of Jordan Mickey, so that hurt Adebayo slightly. Kelly Olynyk is on a roll, but we could see Bam get more run if Hassan Whiteside (hip) needs to miss time. He's probably not worth adding unless we hear Whiteside is out beyond tonight.

             That's good news that the team is calling it mild, but hamstring strains really can linger. Wade took the last shot of the third quarter and he looked fine in the process. He also didn't have a limp as he went to the locker room and the Heat were up 108-76, so it doesn't look like he'll miss extended time. If he is out, that's more run for Tyler Johnson, Wayne Ellington and Justise Winslow. Rodney McGruder would get in the rotation, too.

             He looked to pull a hammy and was in a lot of discomfort. Mejri probably will miss time with this, so there should be more run for Dwight Powell and maybe Nerlens Noel when he's not resting.

            James Harden (knee) is unlikely to play against the Mavs on Sunday, according to Tim MacMahon of ESPN.com.
        
        
             It's the front end of a back-to-back set, so the Rockets probably don't need him against Dallas. Harden likely isn't dealing with anything serious after he thrived in the fourth on Friday night. This is obviously a brutal blow for fantasy owners in important matchups to lose an MVP game to end their week -- he also sat out a Sunday game during the fantasy playoffs last year, too. Chris Paul will be the man while everyone else should step up equally. Eric Gordon would likely start and may be the No. 2 beneficiary.

Plus, his specific return to play timing will be established in relation to his continued evaluation and daily recovery progress. With him out, it'll be a team effort for the Cavs. Jeff Green will start while the rest of the perimeter guys also benefit.

             First off, make sure he's not on your waiver wire. Leonard is not on the trip for the three-game stretch right now, and an additional report from the San Antonio Express News adds ""there is gathering hope he might be able to return in the middle of this month."" He'll obviously have a minutes limit, but this is awesome news for basketball fans and fantasy owners.

             The biggest takeaway from this one is start centers in DFS against the Suns.

             He had his money green light with 15 attempts from the field, making just six of them. Daniels closed this game out as the Suns cut a 22-point deficit to just two points at 2:31 left in the fourth. Obviously the Suns need offense, and Daniels should get plenty of shots while Devin Booker (triceps), T.J. Warren (back) and Josh Jackson (knee) are out, but the Suns are off until Tuesday. Just keep an eye on these injuries and leave Daniels on the wire in most leagues.

             That's somewhat low usage considering how the Suns were missing so many players. Payton also wasn't running the offense nearly as much as expected with Devin Booker out. Payton has cooled off in a big way after a strong start, but we've taken a ride on the Payton roller coaster before. He should be solid the rest of the way.

            Shaq Harrison looked good in his first NBA start against the Hornets on Saturday, scoring a career-high 14 points with two rebounds, four assists, two steals, one block and one 3-pointer in 21 minutes.
        
        
             He did almost all of his work in the first half with all 14 points coming before the 11-minute mark in the third quarter. Harrison thrived off the ball and he was able to get into the lane at any time he wanted. He also handled the ball more than expected, even next to Elfrid Payton. After playing just 17 minutes next to Elf all season, this strong game bodes very well for Harrison to get additional wing minutes. He's only worth a look in deep leagues with the Suns off for two days. Also, his 10-day deal ends on Tuesday, but you would think the Suns sign him for the year.

             He was a ghost in the first half and maybe a coach talked to him before the fourth because he scored 14 in that frame. Bender only attempted two shots in the first three quarter for two points, but he drove to the hoop and fired contested threes. The second-year forward also played small forward for the first time in a while, and he closed out at the center spot as the Suns made a run. We'll chalk this up to being a tease for now.

             It was his best game and it wasn't close. The Suns made a run early in the fourth, and it led to coach Jay Triano closing with the rookie. Reed has not played well up to this point, so we would have to see it again before signing off as a pickup. If Devin Booker, (triceps), Josh Jackson (knee) and T.J. Warren (back) are out, Reed could be a factor. Just keep an eye on him.

Whiteside didn't have any ugly falls on Thursday against the 76ers and he was terrific in that win, so maybe this is a nagging injury. While he's out, it's time for Kelly Olynyk and Bam Adebayo to step up. James Johnson and Justise also benefit because Olynyk won't take many PF minutes.

             This isn't surprising and Parsons likely will have heavy restrictions the rest of the way.

             He suffered the injury on Tuesday and hasn't been back since. The Warriors are using more traditional five-man lineups with a true center while Omri Casspi and Nick Young have also played more.

             It's a new injury for the two-way guy. He played 30 minutes on Friday and didn't do much with just eight points. If he can't play, the Warriors are going to have to roll out a lot of no-PG lineups with Shaun Livingston possibly getting extended run for most of the 48.

             He's been out for a week with his lower back strain and he was called questionable on Thursday for Friday's game before being ruled out. Shootaround will be an important update for his status. If he's out, we will probably get a good amount of Zach Randolph with possibly some Jack Cooley action.

             He had a bad fall on Friday and tried to play through it, but he was ruled out in the second half. Labissiere said he was fine and he had a heat pad on him as he was on the bench after he was ruled out, so he may not be out long. Although, this is the Sacramento Kings. If Willie Cauley-Stein is out, there should be some Zach Randolph while Kosta Koufos could rest.

             The Suns are ridiculously thin on the wing and they'll go with three players who have played minutes at PG. Harrison has been a thief in his 12.5 minutes per game at 1.3 per, so he could be getting a bunch there. He's locked down guys on defense and you can probably pencil him in for 30-plus minutes. He's worth a look in season long and we like him a lot for DFS today.

             He said he had trouble raising his arm, so there's a decent chance he's out beyond today. With him, Josh Jackson and T.J. Warren out, the Suns are now missing their best three perimeter players. Elfrid Payton is going to be busy as the primary ball-handler while Troy Daniels chucks treys. We've only seen 17 minutes of Elf next to Shaq Harrison, but you can bet that number goes up today. We'll see more Davon Reed, who is probably going to start. Hey, at least it's 75 degrees in Phoenix today.

             He wants to play and it doesn't sound like this will be serious, so he's testing it out right now. Both T.J. Warren and Josh Jackson are already out, so losing Booker would decimate their wing depth. We're probably looking at a decent amount of Shaq Harrison, Troy Daniels and Davon Reed today.

That's not much in nine-category leagues, but Green could be an option in DFS or points leagues.

             He suffered a lower back strain on Friday night and did not return. Hood doesn't need an MRI, but chances are he needs some time off. Considering his history, he's probably going to miss at least a couple games. His fantasy owners probably shouldn't bother waiting to see how long. It'll be J.R. Smith, George Hill, Jordan Clarkson, Kyle Korver and Jeff Green getting more minutes.

             He's back. Jennings had some good times with the Bucks, including a 55-point game in 2009. He may get minutes at some point because the Bucks are struggling and they lack a lot of perimeter depth. He still shouldn't be added in fantasy until he does something noteworthy.

             He missed Friday's game against the Lakers, and getting a probable tag for tomorrow likely means he was held out as a precaution. Chandler has dealt with a lot of hip injuries before and has had surgery, so it's possible this becomes an issue later. It was Juan Hernangomez picking up the most minutes on Friday, but he's not an add.

             ""He seems to be OK,"" Gentry said. Davis went through warmups on Friday and wasn't ruled out until about 50 minutes before tip time. Gentry was encouraged Davis would play in this Sunday game before and after the Friday game, so there's certainly a chance AD can get his third game of the week in here. Expect an update at shootaround tomorrow.

As is the case with all concussions, there is no way to set a timetable for his return. Each player responds differently. Brown will be able to return only after he has cleared the NBA's concussion protocol. Terry Rozier, Marcus Smart and Marcus Morris will divvy up extra minutes in Brown's absence.

He missed two games way back in October due to a left knee effusion, but has not had any reported issues with the knee since then. We should expect an update on his status later tonight when coach Rick Carlisle addresses the media at approximately 7:00 pm EST. If Smith is unable to play, J.J. Barea would likely draw the start. Kyle Collinsworth and Yogi Ferrell would also see an uptick in minutes.

             T.J. Warren (back) and Josh Jackson (knee) have already been ruled out for Saturday, so the Suns would be extremely shorthanded if Booker is also unable to play. This is shaping up a game-time decision. The Suns tip off at 5:00 pm EST, so we should have final confirmation, one way or the other, at approximately 3:30 pm, when coach Jay Triano addresses the media pregame.

If Gordon did suffer a concussion, it would be his third since April of 2016.

             Rivers ended up with six assists, three steals and three rebounds while hitting one 3-pointer and finishing with a plus-15 rating. He is hitting a respectable 50.0 percent (28-of-56) from the field in four March outings, averaging 18.0 points, 4.0 rebounds and 3.5 assists with 1.3 steals and 2.8 3-pointers per game. He continues to be a cheap source of triples, steals and assists.

             Harrell was a very efficient 8-of-13 from the field while going 4-of-5 from the free-throw stripe while adding five rebounds and a blocked shot. He also turned in a very nice plus-12 rating. Harrell has back-to-back games with 20 or more points for the first time in his career. He'll look to make it three games in a row on Saturday night against the Magic. Consider him in all deeper fantasy leagues and as a low-cost DFS option while running hot.

             Jordan took advantage of the small lineup of the Cavs, who were missing Tristan Thompson (ankle). It was his second straight 20-plus rebound game, and he has hit the mark in three of his four March outings. He now has 11 games with 20 or more rebounds this season. He'll look to keep it going against Nikola Vucevic and the visiting Magic on Saturday night.

             Green was seeing a few more minutes with both Rodney Hood (back) and Cedi Osman (hip) each checking out of the game due to injuries. If one or both remain on the shelf it will likely be Green seeing a bump in playing time on Sunday against the Lakers. He might be a decent mid-tier DFS play as a result.

He also stayed in the game and wasn't in visible pain for most of the second quarter. Labissiere has looked the part of a true power forward lately and played well for his fifth game in a row with eight points, seven boards, one assist and one block in 22 minutes on Friday. His owners should wait to see what's up before Sunday before making a move.

            Shaun Livingston came off the bench in Friday's game at Portland, finishing with six points over 18 minutes.
        
        
             Livingston was coming off the bench for head coach Steve Kerr, who elected to use Quinn Cook in the starting lineup with Steph Curry (ankle) on the shelf. He went 3-of-5 from the field with two assists and a rebound, as neither Livingston nor Cook did very much to help pick up the slack in Curry's stead.

            Quinn Cook ended up with eight points across 30 minutes in Friday's start at Portland.
        
        
             Cook went 3-of-8 from the field, including 0-of-3 from behind the arc, and he offered just one rebound among the other stat categories. He was making a start in place of Steph Curry (ankle), but failed to take advantage of the situation. Cook might make another start Sunday in Minnesota if Curry is still sidelined, but he is a risky DFS option.

             McGee was effective in his 20 minutes on the floor, adding two rebounds, an assist, a steal and a blocked shot. He is working on a season-best three-game streak with double-digit point performances, averaging 11.7 points, 4.7 rebounds and 2.0 blocked shots per game. He is shooting 16-of-22 (72.7 percent) from the field during the impressive three-game span.

             Thompson hit 9-of-19 from the field, including 4-of-7 from behind the 3-point line, while adding 3-of-4 from the free-throw stripe. After a couple of subpar outings he rebounded with a nice total, serving as the secondary scoring option behind Kevin Durant with Stephen Curry (ankle) sidelined. It wasn't a huge night for Thompson, but it was his best in a couple of weeks.

             Durant was 12-of-21 from the field, including 6-of-12 from behind the arc, while going 10-of-10 from the free-throw line. He was picked up the slack with Stephen Curry (ankle) once again on the shelf. KD has averaged 38.5 points, 8.5 rebounds, 5.0 assists, 3.0 blocked shots and 5.0 3-pointers per game across the past two outings with Curry sidelined, or missing most of the game. Next up is a trip to the Twin Cities to meet the Timberwolves on Sunday afternoon.

             As expected, the Magic used him alongside Shelvin Mack for stretches and they will have to get creative with some of their lineups while Evan Fournier (knee) and Aaron Gordon (hip) are out. Augustin was averaging 10.4 points, 5.5 assists, 0.9 steals and 1.6 triples as a fill-in starter prior to Friday, but he's just a low-end player going forward and the Magic have a terrible fantasy playoff schedule (3-3-3 over the next few weeks).

             He's not going to shoot 9-of-15 from the field every night, but this is an indication that we can expect big things from Simmons while Evan Fournier (knee) and Aaron Gordon (concussion) are out. The bad news is that Orlando has a terrible fantasy playoff schedule, playing just three games in each of the next three weeks.

             He's a solid off-ball guard and the Kings could stick with him in the starting lineup while De'Aaron Fox is out. However, there's always going to be some rest risk on Temple, so it's really tough to call him an add even if this game was a 50-point outing. If he's confirmed as the starter again on Sunday, give him a look as a streamer or DFS play. Congrats if you played him today.

             He's really struggled with his shot in his last two with this 3-of-12 and an 0-of-6 on Wednesday. However, he's really grown as a facilitator and the Kings will bank on that while De'Aaron Fox is out. He's a rookie, so he'll have some bad games. He should still probably be owned.

             He's still looking for his shot, finishing 2-of-8 from the field. On the bright side, Isaac didn't have a single foul after committing five in his last game. He's a great source of money stats and added five more of them tonight, but he's more of a defensive specialist for the time being. That could change if he starts getting 30 minutes on a regular basis, something that could easily happen with Evan Fournier (knee) and Aaron Gordon (concussion) on the shelf.

             He had one of the highlights of the night with a steal followed by a reverse slam in transition, but all in all it was a pretty quiet game. Still, you have to love the workload and we know it's going to be there as long as  Evan Fournier (knee) and Aaron Gordon (concussion) are out.  Hezonja averaged 16.9 points, 5.7 rebounds, 1.9 assists, 0.7 blocks, 1.8 steals and 2.3 triples in a nine-game stretch the last time Gordon missed action, so he has to be owned in standard leagues.

             He'll have his bad games, but overall the numbers are good on Hield before this horrible game. He should also see more chances while De'Aaron Fox (back) is out of the lineup. The second-year guard is still a hold in most leagues.

             His energy was off the charts in this game as he got into the lane all night. Of course, the layups were not going down, but overall it's a very encouraging game for usage and playing time. Mason was also gassed during this game and fell down as he was out of breath in the second half, so hopefully his conditioning is better on Sunday. He'll probably struggle in FG%, but Mason is worth a look if you need a PG while De'Aaron Fox is out.

             There he is. He made a career-high 10 free throws on his 11 attempts, and his four steals were also a career best. Murray is also a slight winner from the Wilson Chandler (hip) injury because he's lost a few late minutes to Will Barton sliding into his spot with the other starters. Murray's usage rate is down since the break and it could take a hit with Paul Millsap back, but he was shooting 22.6 percent from deep since the break before tonight and that won't continue. The Blue Arrow should be in all standard lineups.

             O'Quinn was very effective from the floor, going 6-of-8 while adding 2-of-2 from the free-throw line. He also chipped in with six assists, two rebounds, three blocked shots and a steal in his limited work. O'Quinn has been alternative solid stat lines with poor ones lately. That type of inconsistency makes him risky to use outside of deeper fantasy play.

If you have been stashing for a while, things are looking up in a big way.

The 18 points were the second most of his career, three shy of his career best 21 set on April 2, 2017 in Phoenix. He remains useful only in the deepest of fantasy formats at this juncture.

             He had a bad fall in the first half and was down for about two minutes, but Labissiere stayed in the game after that. Presumably, Labissiere is dealing with some lingering pain from the bad fall and the Kings pulled the plug here. It's too bad because he was playing the best ball of his career over a multiple-game stretch. His owners should hold for now and he was sitting on the bench in good spirits. While he's out, Jack Cooley and JaKarr Sampson are probably headed for more run.

            Gary Harris scored 19 points with five rebounds, five assists, three steals and five 3-pointers in 39 minutes against the Lakers on Friday.
        
        
             He still doesn't get the credit he deserves for his shooting as he's one of the best jump shooters in the NBA. Harris had said his goal was to shoot 45 percent from deep this year, and now he's up to 40.7 percent on his 371 attempts. He's sitting on a 60 TS% and he's looking at early-round value in standard leagues for a long time.

            Lonzo Ball notched 15 points with eight rebounds, eight assists, four steals, one block and one triple in 38 minutes in a 125-116 loss to the Nuggets on Friday.
        
        
             What a difference a couple months can make. Ball was putting up some historically bad shooting numbers to begin the year, but he's starting to find the shooting touch he showcased at UCLA and continues to make his teammates around him look better. He's now played 33+ minutes in five straight games, averaging 13.4 points, 6.6 assists, 5.8 rebounds, 1.0 blocks, 3.0 steals and 3.2 triples. He's only hitting 43.1% of his shots and is 1-of-4 from the line in that span, but his fantasy owners will live with that if he keeps putting up numbers like these.

             Not good. Hood has a really tough time shaking injuries, but he hasn't had noteworthy back issues since 2016. His fantasy owners almost have to drop him because his upside isn't great anyway. It'll be a team effort with George Hill, Jordan Clarkson, Cedi Osman and J.R. Smith getting a few extra minutes.

             The Jazz are suddenly hot again with another five game winning streak. Add that to their 11-game win streak, and they're at 17-2 over their last 19 games. Mitchell hasn't had any ""wow"" games in this new stretch, but he's still solid with averages of 20.8 points, 4.4 boards, 4.6 assists, 1.0 steals and 2.6 treys in the five wins. He's shaping up to be a third- or second-round pick next season.

             Muhammad didn't play much, but he had the six points while going 2-of-2 from the free-throw line with a rebounds and a steal. It will likely take an injury or two before Muhammad has any kind of meaningful role in Cream City. Still, his presence might carve into the minutes of Ian Snell, especially if he goes scoreless across 27 minutes like he did Friday.

             He has really figured it out again and he's been one of the best backup power forwards in the league since joining Utah. In fact, when he's with the other four starters not named Derrick Favors, that unit has a +31.2 net rating to make them one of the best units in hoops over their 76 minutes. Crowder is worth a long look in standard leagues.

             Beal has been logging a ton of minutes lately including 43 in each of his last two games, but he got some valuable rest down the stretch of this one, playing just 29 minutes in the blowout. That's huge with the Wizards traveling to Miami for the second night of a back-to-back. His durability was really the only big question mark entering the season but he's putting those concerns to bed and hasn't missed a single game all year.

             Bledsoe wasn't a big part of the offense, as Giannis Antetokounmpo and Khris Middleton were accounting for 58 of the 79 points by the team's starting five. He didn't have a banner game, turning it over five times while going 0-of-2 from the free-throw stripe, too. He'll look to pick up the pace in Monday's road game against the Grizzlies.

             Anthony Davis (ankle) sat this one out and no one else was hitting shots, so Miller stepped up. He does have some low-end appeal when Davis is on the shelf, but coach Alvin Gentry was optimistic that AD would be back on Sunday. For that reason, Miller is only worth monitoring unless we get bad news.

             He's playing a ton with 38 minutes in each of his previous two games with a DNP-Personal in between. McLemore looks like he's ticketed for big minutes all year and he's been scoring the ball well, but it wouldn't be a total shock to see him be a DNP-Rest on Saturday. He's a low-end hold in deeper leagues.

             Henson was a very effective 5-of-7 from the field when called upon at the offensive end, but suffered a minor knee tweak when Frank Ntilikina's knee caught the inside of Henson's knee. He was in pain for about a minute, but he stayed in the game and looked fine. He also chipped in with four rebounds, four blocked shots, two assists and a steal. Henson tied a season best with the four swats. Next up is a trip to Memphis on Monday, kicking off a three-game week.

             He's been as hot as he has been all year with 25.0 points per game over his previous two games. However, Brooks continues to do little else on the stat sheet, so he's basically a cheaper version of Reggie Bullock in standard leagues. He could be busy on Saturday, though.

             The Grizzlies are probably going to rest Gasol on Saturday, so his fantasy owners will have to be looking out for that.  If he's active, he should be able to produce with the Grizzlies not dialing his minutes back with only a 0.7 minute-per-game drop post-break.

            Khris Middleton ended up scoring 30 points on 11-of-16 shooting in Friday's game against the Knicks.
        
        
             Middleton came alive going 2-of-4 from behind the arc while going a perfect 6-of-6 from the free-throw stripe. The 30 points tied for his most since he dumped in 31 points on Dec. 8 against the Mavericks. He entered the game shooting just 12-of-34 (35.3 percent) from the field over the past three contests, so fantasy owners hope this will spur him on. Next up is a trip to Memphis on Monday to start a three-game week.

            Nikola Mirotic couldn't get his shot to fall on Friday vs. the Wizards, hitting 3-of-11 attempts for nine points.
        
        
             He burned a lot of fantasy owners tonight because expectations were extremely high without Anthony Davis (ankle). To be fair to Mirotic, only one starter scored in double digits for the Pelicans (Rajon Rondo with 11). Mirotic still managed to grab 12 rebounds with one assist and a steal, and he'll look to get back on track vs. the Jazz on Sunday.

            Jrue Holiday matched his season-low of four points on Friday vs. the Wizards, hitting 2-of-8 shots in 28 minutes.
        
        
             He was a popular target in DFS, as Anthony Davis (ankle) sat this one out and Holiday has per-36 averages of 29.2 points, 3.8 boards, 8.1 assists, 1.3 steals, 1.1 blocks and 3.1 treys with both AD and DeMarcus Cousins (Achilles) off the floor. Holiday couldn't salvage his line either, adding just three rebounds and two assists. He did have three blocks, though. Holiday has second-round value on the season and is crushing his ADP, so his fantasy owners should just chalk this up as an off night.

             Antetokounmpo ended up hitting 7-of-15 from the field, while a majority of his scoring was done at the free-throw line. He was 14-of-18 from the charity stripe, his most made free throws and most attempts since he was 17-of-22 from the line back on Dec. 2 against Sacramento. He'll have a couple of days to rest before the Bucks head to Memphis on Monday to start a three-game work week.

             He beat the Rockets at their game with plenty of treys, especially in the early going. In fact, Lowry at one point had six 3-pointers while the Rockets only had one make at that time. Lowry's scoring was actually way down coming in at just 13.9 points per game since the break, but basically every other stat was just fine. We've seen Lowry take a couple usage dips, but obviously his fantasy owners don't care as long as he's out there for 32-35 minutes.

             The game was a blowout and Diallo played the entire fourth quarter with 10 of his 14 points in that span, so he could've had a much bigger night if coach Alvin Gentry went to him earlier. Diallo only played more than 20 minutes in one other game this season and put up 13 points, 15 rebounds, one assist and three steals, and he also averaged 13.4 points, 10.6 rebounds and 0.8 blocks in the five games that he played more than 22 minutes as a rookie last season. It sounds like Anthony Davis (ankle) will likely be back on Sunday, so he's not an add unless we get bad news.

He has a +14.1 net rating on the season and continues to bury opponents. It's been a Nightmare on L Street for their foes when scary Freddy is out there. Lame reference aside, he should be owned in standard leagues.

             This was a nice parting gift to his fantasy owners, as he's not going to be able to hold onto his value when he moves back to the bench in the near future. Darren Collison looked excellent and saw more minutes than expected (21 minutes) in his first game back, so Joseph can be dropped in standard leagues for a hot free agent.

             He got all his damage done early with the score getting out of hand late. Dipo hit 7-of-9 shots tonight, a huge relief after hitting just 11-of-38 in his previous two games. Oladipo's true shooting percentage and EFG% are higher when Darren Collison is on the floor, so apart from a small dip in usage rate his fantasy value shouldn't change much. He's locked in as a first-round stud for the fantasy playoffs.

             He was so tired at the half that he said he struggled to get through the halftime interview, but he looked solid and it's a great sign that he was on the floor in the fourth quarter with the Pacers up big -- he was also only expected to play 10-15 minutes. The Pacers only have one more back-to-back set this season and it's not until April, so they will be able to ramp up his workload without any DNPs. He might not be ready for a full workload for a couple more games, but it's good to see him back with most fantasy playoffs starting up after this weekend and he should be back in the starting lineup in a game or two.

             He played down the stretch and was on James Harden for most of his playing time. Powell seems to have coach Dwane Casey's trust, so he may be getting a few more starts. Of course, this stat line leaves a lot to be desired. He's more of a stream while OG Anunoby (ankle) and Delon Wright (toe) are out.

             The Rockets' 17-game streak finally comes to an end, and it had a lot to do with their terrible start in the first with Toronto going up 32-16. Harden almost willed the Rockets back with some crazy clutch buckets including a game-tying trey at 2:10 left, but the Raptors had some answers. Clutch has been a trend for the Rockets on the year, entering tonight with a league-leading +21.9 net rating in the clutch. The clutch time is rare with a league-low 82 minutes, and again they played well down the stretch tonight to almost pull off another comeback -- they never led besides a 2-0 start. Harden has MVP in the bag.

             The Hawks were a disaster tonight and no one in the starting lineup did anything notable. Schroder's low minutes were a result of the lopsided score, but at least he wasn't put into coach Mike Budenholzer's doghouse tonight -- Taurean Prince took care of that this time around. The Hawks will face a team on Sunday (Bulls) that they are racing to the bottom of the standings for lottery balls, so it will be interesting to see if they do anything shady (they rested Kent Bazemore vs. the Suns recently).

             The Raptors looked like they had a game plan to keep Capela off the glass early, but he still had a solid line. Capela also had six offensive rebounds and that aspect of his game has been big time with 3.3 per game on the year, which helps on all those boards from treys. He's had a great year and there's no concern about that calf issue that put him on the injury report today.

             Chicago coming to town certainly helped to get the Pistons off their four-game losing streak. They're still 4.5 games behind the Heat for the No. 8 spot, so chances are they'll be giving up a lottery pick in the Blake Griffin trade -- the odds are currently just 2.5 percent that they keep the pick. As for Blake, he's heating up again with 25-plus points in four straight, so his fantasy owners have to feel better. The Pistons are off for three days now.

             Taurean Prince was benched for poor play and the game was a complete blowout, so we can't put too much stock into this.

             He cleaned up in garbage time with 12 points in a three-minute span of the fourth quarter, so it's hard to get too excited about this line. The Hawks have shown that their willing to rest their key guys such as Dennis Schroder and Kent Bazemore, so Dorsey could be a sneaky play on the nights when Atlanta is shorthanded. He's also on the deep-league radar, playing 25+ minutes in three straight games with double-digit points in each.

Mason is worth a look if you need a guard and he's serious chalk in DFS tonight.

             Detroit hasn't been kind to LaVine with this dud and also tearing his ACL against the Pistons on Feb. 2 of last year. LaVine is still expected to have a minutes limit and back-to-back restriction from that injury, but he doesn't appear to be a part of the rest movement. He obviously needs to hit shots and is down to just 34.2 percent from the field in his last five.

             His minutes were dialed back a bit, and somewhat surprisingly Dunn picked up one minute in garbage time. Cameron Payne was actually decent on the offensive side, and it's possible this becomes closer to a 60/40 minute split. Still, Dunn is playing well enough to still hold value at around 30 minutes per game.

             The Hawks haven't bothered to update his status since he went back to the locker room after six minutes of playing time. He's currently Dennis Schroder's backup, and with Malcolm Delaney (ankle) also out we got to see fourth-string PG Josh Magette get some run tonight. We'll consider Taylor questionable for Sunday's game vs. the Bulls, but he belongs on the wire in standard leagues.

             Yikes on the shooting here, but it was a good sign for Portis with Robin Lopez only playing in the first quarter.

             Despite the bad game, the rotation was slightly encouraging with Justin Holiday not playing beyond the first quarter in his start. Nwaba got the start in the third quarter, but he was all out of whack on the offensive side. He will probably need to hit 30 minutes to be valuable for most fantasy owners, so this may not be a situation fantasy owners will want to pursue.

             He played the whole first, and he didn't play at all after that with David Nwaba starting the third. Holiday is likely not going to play at all in the second and fourth quarters after just playing the first and third Wednesday, but now it may not be past the first. It'll be interesting to see how the NBA feels about this, but this plan to not play Holiday beyond the first should be more than enough to satisfy the league. Holiday can't be trusted in fantasy.

            Cameron Payne scored a season-high 17 points with one rebound, two steals and four 3-pointers in 23 minutes against the Pistons on Friday.
        
        
             It was his best game on the season with a hot start, scoring his first 11 points on 110.0 eFG%. The Bulls are preaching youth development and they gave up way to much to get Payne last year, so maybe they up him to minutes in the mid 20s. He's been strong in steals with eight in his last two, but it's really tough to rely on him beyond that. Just keep an eye on him in deep leagues or consider him as a stream some days.

            Taurean Prince was benched for the entire second half of Friday's blowout loss to Indiana, finishing with three points, one rebound, one assist, one block and one triple in 18 minutes.
        
        
             He's healthy according to the Hawks broadcast, meaning this was a coach's decision. Prince didn't show much effort on the defensive end, was invisible on offense and coach Mike Budenholzer has called him out in the past, but hopefully this doesn't become a trend. He was playing really well in his previous three March games with 15.3 points, 5.3 rebounds, 2.0 assists, 1.0 blocks, 1.7 steals and 4.3 triples, so it will be interesting to see if he can get back on track vs. the Bulls on Sunday.

             This has shutdown written all over it. Bradley may need offseason surgery and there's a good chance we don't see him again this season. This is terrible timing with Bradley hitting free agency this summer. Drop him if you haven't already.

             He has a fracture in his hand and is out for at least two weeks, so he's still going to be out until at least the 16th.

             The Magic are shorthanded with Evan Fournier (knee) and Aaron Gordon (concussion) on the shelf. Isaac should be a great source of defensive stats, but we'll be watching to see if he can find his rhythm on offense. He's played about 16 minutes per game since returning from his ankle injury, but that number is expected to rise to 25 tonight. If he puts together a strong line tonight he'll be a hot pickup off the wire.

             This is an expected move with Evan Fournier (knee) and Aaron Gordon (concussion) out. We don't know how long those guys are going to be out, but the Magic may be very cautious given their position in the standings. Hezonja was putting up early-round numbers the last time AG went down, so he has to be picked up everywhere and can be considered a must-start player.

He's worth a look if you're targeting steals, but he's been disappointing for the most part this season.

             The Pelicans will also start Rajon Rondo, Jrue Holiday, E'Twaun Moore and Emeka Okafor. Coach Alvin Gentry was optimistic that Davis would return on Sunday, but Mirotic will get all the touches he can handle tonight and has monster upside.

            Wilson Chandler (right hip soreness) is questionable to face the Lakers on Friday.
        
        
             This is the same right hip that required surgery and kept him out for a season, so this is something to watch. Chandler has been great lately, but the Nuggets may choose to hold him out. Will Barton should see a few more minutes and is a good bet to start. We could see more Malik Beasley or Darrell Arthur help out, too.

We haven't heard about any restrictions, but the Wizards will be watching him closely. He's safe to deploy in season-long leagues, while Kelly Oubre loses some streaming appeal.

             OK then. While AD is doubtful to play today and Gentry said he's unlikely this afternoon, the coach did say he's ""optimistic"" on AD playing Sunday. ""I don't think think it's that big of a deal,"" Gentry said. ""It's a sprained ankle. It'll be OK."" With him likely out, we'll see a slew of guys stepping up.

            Anthony Davis (ankle) could be going through pregame warmups to feel out whether or not he’s able to play against the Wizards on Friday.
        
        
             Translation: AD is probably a game-time decision. He doesn't have structural damage in his ankle, and he is technically doubtful to play. We'll obviously be watching this closely with updates along the way. If he's out, there will be more Darius Miller, Emeka Okafor, Ian Clark and hopefully Cheick Diallo.

             He's coming off a 17-point game and was a big part of a comeback win over the Pistons. Powell is going to have to stay hot to get minutes late in the game, but two other closing candidates, OG Anunoby and Delon Wright, are out. If he plays well and maybe if Fred VanVleet doesn't start rolling, Powell could be a solid DFS play. While it's an attractive matchup, there's risk, of course.

             Kerr also said the team previously mapped out a plan to make sure he was available late in the season, so this confirms the Warriors could be looking to rest players later. He's headed for some consistent minutes, especially with how the Warriors won't play Shaun Livingston too much. Cook is still only an add in very deep leagues.

With him out, the Kings would be less likely to rest Zach Randolph and Kosta Koufos, but both are not on the table for DFS cash. We'll see a lot of Skal Labissiere and perhaps JaKarr Sampson gets pulled out of the garage.

             He was listed as questionable yesterday, but there's not much value in that report. This report is somewhat bad news for Fox to get ruled out well before warmups, especially with the Kings track record. He could miss multiple games. With him out, it's Frank Mason III season. In his last NBA start, he played 34 minutes with seven points, for boards, five dimes and two steals. Even if he doesn't start and it's Garrett Temple, Mason is the guy you want.

The injury occurred with 4:05 left in the second quarter of Charlotte’s game at Toronto on March 4. Malik Monk has not played well at all, but he'll be getting an opportunity for the rest of the season.

             It was a surprise Thursday afternoon that Warren had back spasms, but it's certainly not a surprise he's likely out again. He's taken a while to recover from injuries and the Suns are in a race for lottery balls, so we're expecting Warren to miss multiple games. If Josh Jackson is out and Booker as well, get ready for some wacky lineups with more Shaq Harrison, Davon Reed and Troy Daniels filling wing minutes.

             Well, we mentioned how Chandler was in discomfort after a fall under the basket last night, so that probably explains this. Chandler's injury may not be too bad, but the Suns aren't going to play him at less than 100 percent. Alex Len's fantasy value could be revived here, but it was very noteworthy that Alec Peters played with the rotation 1-4 guys last night. Feel free to add Len again, but be prepared for disappointment.

             That's not good after Booker scored 30 points on Thursday against the Thunder. While he's said he wants to play and doesn't want to rest, the Suns are likely going to ask him to do a lot to get him cleared as they fight for the top spot in the lotto. If he's out along with Josh Jackson and T.J. Warren, the Suns are going to be ridiculously thin. It'll be Troy Daniels, Davon Reed and plenty of Shaq Harrison at the SG spot to fill the wing minutes.

            The Thunder announced on Friday that Terrance Ferguson has a concussion and is in the NBA's concussion protocol.
        
        
             Ferguson collided with Steven Adams in the second half of Tuesday's win over Phoenix and dropped to the floor. As is the case with all concussions, the Thunder don't have a timeline for his return. However, he's not a significant part of the Thunder's rotation even when fully healthy. Thus, he should be left on waivers.

            Otto Porter (bruised right hip) participated in shootaround and is a game-time decision for Friday's matchup against New Orleans.
        
        
             Porter initially injured his hip in Tuesday's win over the Heat. He took a shot to the right hip in the fourth quarter, retreated to the locker room, and was unable to return. However, he avoided a serious injury, with the Wiz calling him day-to-day. The fact that he was able to partake in shootaround is a welcomed sign. We should have confirmation of his status for Friday's game at approximately 6:30 PM est, when coach Scott Brooks addresses the media pregame. Kelly Oubre and Markieff Morris will see extended minutes if Porter can't play.

             Noel, who is working his way back after being sidelined by thumb surgery, played well in the Mavs win over Denver on Tuesday. He finished with eight points, a season-high 14 rebounds, one steal and a block in 26 minutes. If he continues to see 25-plus minutes a night, he could hold some value over the final month of the season.

             Kennard started for Detroit on Wednesday and finished with nine points (3-of-8 FGs, 1-of-2 FTs), six rebounds, three assists and two 3-pointers in a career-high 31 minutes. Despite coming off the bench on Friday, there should still be plenty of minutes available for Kennard, as Stanley Johnson (back) is unlikely to play.

             Lopez started each of the Bulls first 57 games this season, but was a healthy scratch in each of Chicago's first seven games after the All-Star break. However, the NBA issued a warning to the Bulls on resting healthy players earlier this week, prompting Hoiberg to re-insert RoLo into the lineup. Lopez averaged 27.7 minutes per contest in the first half, but will likely see far fewer minutes over the final month of the season, which limits his fantasy value. Bobby Portis and Cristiano Felicio will also see their minutes reduced.

             After missing 11 straight games, Collison has been optimistic about his chances of suiting up on Friday night. And, despite likely coming off the bench in his first game back, Collison could start again as early as Sunday's game vs. the Celtics.

            Coach Steve Clifford labeled the Hornets performance during their loss to the Nets on Thursday night as ""totally unacceptable.""
        
        
             Brooklyn easily beat the Hornets 125-111 in Charlotte on Thursday. ""We owe it to each other, to the organization, to [owner] Michael [Jordan], and to our fans that we don’t play like that,"" Clifford said after the game. Several veterans were also critical of the team's effort and execution. The Hornets will look to shake up their roster this offseason, but are hamstrung by a number of cumbersome contracts.

             Collison has missed 11 straight games due to knee surgery, but appears to be on track to return to the lineup Friday night. On Thursday, Collison told reporters that ""throughout this whole week when I was getting up and down, I didn't feel any pain."" We should have an update from the team by Friday afternoon. Cory Joseph and Lance Stephenson will see fewer minutes at point guard once Collison returns.

            The Lakers plan to sign Derrick Williams to a 10-day contract, according to Shams Charania of Yahoo Sports.
        
        
             Williams split time between the Heat and Cavs in 2016-17. However, he was unable to find a team willing to sign him last summer and played in China. He will only see spot minutes in L.A. and should be left on waivers in all fantasy formats.

             He's not even going to travel to allow him to recover from his right ankle sprain in the Bay Area. We've seen Curry have recurring ankle issues before and he's needed surgery before his MVP run, so making sure he's 100 percent is easily the Warriors' top priority right now after his fourth right ankle issue since December. He could miss more games, which would be a massive blow to fantasy owners when it counts the most. Expect it to be a team effort to step up with Quinn Cook possibly starting.

             It was the KD show with 14 straight points late in the fourth to get the Warriors even after a rough start in the second half. Stephen Curry (ankle) only playing two minutes was a factor here, and of course KD has been awesome without Steph. In his previous minutes without Curry, Durant has per-36 averages of 28.7 points, 7.8 boards, 5.7 dimes, 2.5 blocks, 0.9 steals and 2.6 treys. His fantasy value could be seeing a slight uptick in the short term.

             He earned the 22nd career triple-double on a putback to help the Warriors get a 107-105 lead. Besides his assists, all of Green's counting stats were down after the break compared to before in points, treys, boards, blocks, steals and having more turnovers. He'll be asked to do more while Stephen Curry (ankle) is out, but it's possible Green gets a night off at some point in the next month.

             ""It's nothing serious,"" he told ESPN. Thompson scored 13 points with two boards, six dimes and one 3-pointer against the Spurs on Thursday. He gets a massive usage rate boost when he's not with Curry, sitting at 26.8 without him and just 19.8 with him. Thompson's rebounding rate, assist rate and defensive rating also improve in that time, but his efficiency has dropped. He could see additional shots if the Dubs do take it easy on Curry, but keep an eye out for rest on Friday.

             Coach Steve Kerr summed up Pierre pretty well during his in-game interview, saying he's really tall and he jumps really high. The Warriors are thin up front and they could be thin again on Friday, so McGee could get close to 20 minutes again vs. Portland. He's still only a punt play in DFS or a stream.

             This wasn't the LMA that scored just 11.3 points per game in his final three games against the Dubs in the postseason last year, and the version that scored just seven on Monday. He'll likely be the lone Spurs big when he's on the court, so his boards could see a nice increase. Plus, this should relieve some concerns about any lingering ankle or knee issues.

He should be owned in standard leagues.

             No surprise here at all in a back-to-back set. Curry is going to travel to Portland, and he didn't have his ankle wrapped after the game as he celebrated with his teammates. This is his fourth right ankle injury since December, so the Warriors will want to be absolutely sure his stability is 100 percent before he is back out there. Quinn Cook is probably going to start and could see more minutes, especially if Shaun Livingston rests. We'll see more Nick Young and the rest of the rotation will obviously have to step up, too. Keep an eye out for more rest, though.

             The minutes were surprisingly low, but maybe the Spurs had a limit on him from an ear injury. Gay was heating up in his two previous games before Monday with 17.0 points per game in 25.0 minutes. He should be better than this, but it's not like the Spurs will totally unleash him while LaMarcus Aldridge is healthy.

             He was LaMarcus Aldridge's backup in this game and that should continue while Pau Gasol (shoulder) is out. There's very little to like here while LMA is healthy.

            Russell Westbrook scored 27 points on 11-of-14 from the field during a 115-87 win over the Suns on Thursday, adding eight rebounds, nine assists and two turnovers in 29 minutes.
        
        
             The elixir known as the Suns will cure a lot of ailments, so the Thunder also snapped a two-game losing streak. Most of their issues have been on the defensive end lately, but Westy has been strong on O. Westbrook's usage rate is way up to 36.0 over his last five with a 58.8 TS%, so he's shaping up to be the top DFS play most nights.

             He didn't play at all in the fourth quarter, so his first start really couldn't have gone better. Brewer is still going to have a tough time getting to 10 attempts from the field, so he'll certainly trend down from this and his 10-point Tuesday night. He's more of a shot-in-the-dark add in deep leagues.

Adams is locked in on efficiency with his 71.1 percent from the field over his last five, averaging 12.8 points, 9.2 boards, 1.4 dimes, 1.4 blocks and 1.6 steals.

Booker also busted out a headband tonight, but after the game he said it was more for function and not form to cover up a cut on his head. He doesn't want to rest, so his fantasy owners should feel pretty good about his value the rest of the way.

He did log more minutes next to Marquese Chriss today and that could continue while the Suns are banged up. Still, Bender is in another slump, so he can't be trusted in most fantasy leagues.

             It was all good just a week ago. Len had a six-block Friday against this OKC team, but he's been unfathomably bad since. In those three games combined he had just 11 points, eight boards, one block and one steal in only 25 minutes. Maybe Tyson Chandler is dinged up again, but it's almost impossible to hold him in fantasy through these struggles. Len's fantasy value has been falling off cliffs so much that it probably should come with a parachute.

             Irving did not play Monday, and coach Brad Stevens told reporters Kyrie was in danger of missing a full week.

Irving was 9-of-15 from the floor, including 3-of-7 from 3-point range, and 2-of-2 from the charity stripe. GM Danny Ainge said he thinks Irving will need to manage his knee pain going forward and hinted as possible rest days, but Kyrie should be ready to roll on Sunday when the C's host the Pacers.

Just keep an eye on Peters, especially with Alex Len falling off a cliff again.

             And he's cold as a scorer again. Over his last four, Payton made just 32.7 percent from the field with averages of 11.0 points, 7.5 boards, 7.5 assists, 1.3 steals, 1.0 blocks and no treys. He's still doing plenty besides the poor shooting and he's making free throws, so his fantasy owners shouldn't worry. He may have to score more with the wing injuries, too.

             The Suns slid Devin Booker to small forward a ton today, which opened up the minutes for Daniels. If both Josh Jackson (knee) and T.J. Warren (back) are out for Saturday, Daniels is probably going to have what his former coach David Fizdale called as a ""money green"" light. He's only a speculative add for now, but he's on the radar for DFS or as specialist. He won't have value if Jackson or Warren are a go, though.

In the Celtics first six games following the All-Star break, Horford averaged just 8.2 points, 5.8 rebounds and 2.8 assists, while converting only 38.0 percent of his field goal attempts. Thus, Thursday's performance was greeted with a welcomed sigh of relief from Horford owners.

The Suns still may choose to be careful with their rookie, but fantasy owners may still want to hold him in just about all leagues.

             He went through some functionality tests to check on his ankle, but the team apparently didn't feel like they needed him to get back out there. Curry wasn't limping too bad when he went to the locker room and the team did call it a ""tweak"" in this recent update. While it wasn't bad, we're still fully expecting him to sit out against the Blazers on Friday night. That'll likely get Quinn Cook called up while the others step up.

             Brown went up for a dunk in the third quarter, but his hands slipped off the rim and he fell backward onto his head. It was a frightening fall, with the arena growing grimly silent and doctors rushing to Brown's side. Fortunately, it appears Brown avoided a serious injury to his neck or back. However, he is going to be tested for a concussion. Here is the full quote from coach Stevens: ""[Brown] felt pretty good leaving the arena. He went to get a CT scan. He’s with [Minnesota’s] team doctor, so he’s in good hands."" We should have further updates on Friday morning.

             His 13 attempts from the field matched a team high and he didn't turn the ball over either.

Wade had his fingerprints all over it with a game-sealing, alley-oop dunk with 51 seconds left, which certainly impressed his coach.

             Ferguson was able to walk back to the locker room under his own power but was clearly disoriented. Now that he's under the concussion protocol, it's unlikely he will be cleared to play Saturday vs. San Antonio. Considering he's not a significant part of the Thunder's rotation even when fully healthy, he belongs on waivers in all fantasy formats.

            Karl-Anthony Towns tallied 15 points, 11 rebounds, three assists and one block in Thursday's loss to the Celtics.
        
        
             The Wolves hadn't played since last Friday, allowing them a very rare six-day break in between contests. However, they looked more rusty than rested on Thursday, as the Celtics jumped out to a 20-point lead in the first half. After the game, Towns had his left hand wrapped. However, KAT told reporters it wouldn't be an issue. ""I'll be fine,"" he said. ""Don't worry about me.""

             He's basically been Hassan Whiteside's backup recently, but of course Kelly Olynyk will be seeing a lot of center minutes to go with the PF run Adebayo isn't worth owning in most leagues with so much competition.

             He wins his second battle in a row with Joel Embiid, and he was clearly pumped on his post-game interview on Heat TV. ""I love it. I love it. I love it. Let's keep it going. I love it,"" he said about the win. Whiteside's minutes were down coming into this game, and he's still going to have to deal with coach Erik Spoelstra sitting him in some fourth quarters. That said, the stats are still there for him overall, so there's nothing to worry about from a fantasy perspective.

            Stephen Curry (right ankle) went to the locker room in the first quarter on Thursday.
        
        
             He rolled his ankle on a drive to the basket as he stepped on Dejounte Murray's foot and was in pain near the tunnel. Curry did come in to shoot the free throws, but the Warriors fouled after that to get him out of the game. He wasn't limping too bad going to the locker room, but of course this is the same right ankle he's now rolled four times since December. He is probably sitting out tomorrow against the Blazers, but this doesn't look bad.

             He will probably be sticking in the starting lineup, but there are a ton of guys that could take minutes from him. Johnson's usage rate should also be in the teens while he's not going to add much else on offense besides some streaky scoring. He has late-round upside, so he's still an OK hold in 12-team leagues.

             Bjelica was on fire all evening, almost singlehandedly keeping the Wolves within striking distance of the Celtics. Bjelica was inserted into the starting lineup in place fo Jimmy Butler back in late February and averaged 10.0 points, 7.8 rebounds and 2.0 assists in 36.5 minutes over the first four games after Butler injured his knee. However, this was Belly's breakout performance. He's logged at least 33 minutes in each start, which gives him a relatively high fantasy floor going forward. He will be a hot pickup this week.

             Coach Erik Spoelstra trusted Winslow late in this game and put him on Ben Simmons a bunch. He also had a slow start with some sloppy play, so getting minutes in the upper 20s is a great sign for him. He'll certainly be falling off from his hot stretch he had while Wayne Ellington was out, but maybe Winslow can still hold value in deeper leagues. Although, his fantasy owners shouldn't be clinging too tightly, but maybe just hold him until he cools off.

             The second unit had it working today, so Richardson's minutes did take a small hit. That said, he's been awesome all season, he was out there on some key late defensive possessions, and it's not like this stat line was bad anyway. He leads the team in minutes, he hasn't missed a game and he continues to put up early-round value for the last three months.

Ellington's volume isn't going to be nearly as high as it was before the break with Dwyane Wade in the mix and the Heat having their depth back. He's not really an add.

             Monk shot 6-of-14 from the field, including just 1-of-6 from downtown. Nonetheless, it qualifies as his best game in quite some time. It is only the second time this season he has dished out more than four dimes. It's also the first time he has scored in double-figures since early November. Coach Steve Clifford said that Monk would see additional minutes with Michael Carter-Williams (left shoulder sprain) sidelined. We'll see if Monk can somehow salvage his rookie season by finishing strong over the final month.

             The Heat get a lot of credit for keeping him contained and not dunking it so much like he has recently. His shot selection has been great lately and he hasn't slowed down too much after his career-high 32 points back on Feb. 22. Since the break, he's been filling it up across the board with averages of 16.4 points, 7.0 boards, 9.2 dimes, 1.0 blocks and 0.9 steals on 61.8 FG%. His free throw totals are also way down recently, so that's another positive.

             He probably isn't getting enough credit for one of the best shooting seasons in the NBA. Over his 15 previous games, Saric sports an elite 63.5 TS% on his 21.1 usage rate to help him to a +9.1 net rating. If you're wondering why the 76ers aren't missing Markelle Fultz at all, look no further than Saric after he probably should've won Rookie of the Year last season.

            Nicolas Batum was disappointingly unproductive in a loss to the Nets on Thursday, finishing with just six points, four rebounds, two assists, one steal and two turnovers in a team-high 33 minutes.
        
        
             Batum had been posting solid all-around numbers prior to this contest. He came into Thursday night averaging 10.6 points, 7.0 rebounds, 9.6 assists, 1.4 steals and 1.4 3-pointers over his last five games. We'll chalk this up as a rare off night. Batum will look to get back on track Saturday vs. Phoenix.

             Howard was 5-of-8 from the floor and was surprisingly efficient from the charity stripe as well, knocking down 9-of-11 from the line. Howard's scoring has been solid, but his rebound numbers have dipped of late. He's averaging just 6.4 boards over his last five contests. The Hornets next game is Saturday vs. the Suns.

             He blew up on Tuesday with 22 points and he was at 48.7 percent from the field in his previous March games, but perhaps no player is more prone to these mega shooting duds than Lord Covington. Still, he's just too good in the other areas on the stat sheet and coach Brett Brown will play him through even the most brutal of slumps, so keep him locked in for all formats.

He shot 7-of-11 from the floor, including a perfect 3-of-3 from deep, and also knocked down all four of his free-throws.

             Dinwiddie didn't grab a single rebound but did have one steal and a block. He has seen his scoring totals drop of late as he tries to find his rhythm playing alongside D’Angelo Russell. However, Dinwiddie has still been racking up the dimes. He's averaging 8.4 assists over his last five.

             He tried to hang on the rim and he slipped off, causing his body to land awkwardly to put a lot of force on his head and neck. He looked dazed just after the fall, but it took a long time to get him off the floor. Brown was able to walk off under his own power and he waved to the crowd on his way out. Hopefully, he's not going to miss time. If he does, we'll see more Terry Rozier, Marcus Smart and Marcus Morris.

             Before the game, coach Kenny Atkinson talked about getting RHJ more involved with more run, so the stat line doesn't disappoint at all. Hollis-Jefferson was running the offense more and his switching on defense was top notch. He's been frustrating to own for about a month, but he had a strong line on Sunday and this line should move the needle on him as a pickup in all standard leagues.

             The Nets continue to use him as a high screener to set up their offense on the vast majority of possessions. Allen also used his body well on defense throughout this game and handled Dwight Howard better than expected despite how the Hornets fed him a bunch, so it looked like he was headed for more minutes until it got to garbage time. Allen is going to struggle against teams like the Warriors, but he's still too solid as a fantasy asset for his owners to worry too much. He's been a sixth-round player over his last 19 games, so keep plugging him in there.

             That's not good and the Suns are now down to Davon Reed to start the third quarter. T.J. Warren (back) is out tonight and Jackson was looking at a huge opportunity, but it's certainly possible he misses time with this injury. The Suns are in the mix for the No. 1 spot in the lottery, and they won't be rushing him back. There could be a pickup to make in deep leagues but we haven't seen enough out of guys like Reed to sign off on him as an add in shallower leagues.

            Aaron Gordon is in the concussion protocol and he will not play on Friday against the Kings.
        
        
             He collided with Julius Randle last night and was experiencing concussion symptoms after the game. Gordon also had a concussion back in November, so that suggests he's likely looking at multiple games on the sidelines. This makes both Jonathan Isaac and Mario Hezonja hot pickups in 12-team leagues.

             The Magic also confirmed that Augustin did suffer the injury on Wednesday, and it's not a lingering issue. He did return to the game on the last possession, so there was not much doubt on the severity. If for some reason he can't go, that means plenty of Shelvin Mack with more Aaron Gordon and Mario Hezonja running the offense.

             ""That would be really disappointing to end my season like that,"" Fournier said about his MCL sprain he suffered on Wednesday. It's almost always discouraging when a player is talking about hopes to play later this season, especially when the Magic have high lottery position. If you need games right now, he's a drop candidate. Meanwhile, Jonathan Isaac, Jonathon Simmons and Mario Hezonja will be stepping up with more fantasy value headed their way.

             Bell sprained his right ankle Tuesday night when he landed on the foot of Rondae Hollis-Jefferson in the Warriors win over the Nets. He had already been ruled out of Thursday's game vs. the Spurs. Coach Steve Kerr said that Bell would also sit out this weekend's contests as well (Golden State plays Friday and Sunday). JaVale McGee and Kevon Looney should see an uptick in minutes with Bell sidelined.

             This is good news after the Kings have been ruling him out early since last week. Cauley-Stein has had back problems before and the Kings have little incentive to play him now. If he's back, that means either Kosta Koufos and/or Zach Randolph would be much more likely to sit.

             He had some stiffness in his back on Wednesday in the first quarter, and he was ruled out about a minute after he went to the locker room. It's still tough to trust how a player was listed on the injury report the day before, but we'll have a better idea at shootaround tomorrow. If he's out, Frank Mason III would be looking at his biggest opportunity is almost two months.

Jackson should be owned in every fantasy leagues because the Suns likely won't be rushing Warren back. He's also played some center, so guys like Marquese Chriss, Alex Len and Dragan Bender benefit. They probably need to play better to be added, though.

             That's not good with the Suns falling to No. 2 in the lottery. Warren has been a slower healer than most, and he's been playing huge minutes with 42 in three of his last four active games. Josh Jackson's fantasy owners hit the jackpot here while other rotation players benefit because Jackson has played some PF and C.

             Huestis has started ten games this season for OKC this season, but is averaging just 3.3 points, 3.8 rebounds and 0.4 assists in 20.8 minutes over those ten starts. He belongs on waivers in all fantasy formats.

             OKC has a lot of options to play next to their four studs, but Brewer looks like the top choice after his 23 minutes on Tuesday. He's still not going to get enough shots most nights and probably won't have value unless he's racking up steals or open treys. Leave him on the wire.

             Miami has some options in the second unit and Justise Winslow is playing the best he has all season. Ellington should still get minutes, but coach Erik Spoelstra has a lot of options to fill out his rotation 6-10. Ellington probably isn't an add in most leagues.

             He suffered the injury on Wednesday and did not return. The severity of the injury isn't known, and it's possible he's only day-to-day. Although, the Magic sit in the No. 4 spot in the lottery and chances are they'll be bringing back Fournier slowly. Fantasy owners can consider dropping him in certain situations, assuming they need him for the next week or so and don't have an IR spot. With him out, it'll be Jonathon Simmons, Mario Hezonja and Jonathan Isaac seeing more run, and are all worth a look depending on what you need. Wes Iwundu could be getting more minutes, but he's not a fantasy option.

             He hasn't played in the last two games with the Grizzlies calling him probable for Monday and questionable for Wednesday up until warmups. If he's out again, JaMychal Green would be busy with more Ivan Rabb, Myke Henry and Ben McLemore getting more run.

             He's been out since the first game since the break and the Grizzlies continue to rule him out early. Clearly, they're not in a rush to bring him back with their 15-game losing streak helping them rise to the top lottery spot. It'll be Kobi Simmons likely getting another start next to Ben McLemore with Xavier Rathan-Mayes and Wayne Selden also getting some extra run. All of those guys could be worth using in fantasy with a back-to-back set coming up.

             He was out for Wednesday for personal reasons, but now he's out for rest. The Grizzlies are on a back-to-back set, so presumably Parsons is going to play on Saturday against the Mavs. If not, they might be hearing from the NBA.

             The MRI was negative for any ligament damage, and he's only day-to-day. This is good news for the Pelicans after AD rolled his ankle as he stepped on Kosta Koufos' foot and he was unable to return on Wednesday. The Pelicans have a huge game coming up against the Jazz on Sunday, so the team may choose to be careful on Friday. If he's out, we'll see more Darius Miller, Emeka Okafor, Ian Clark and Cheick Diallo. Jrue Holiday and Nikola Mirotic will get more shots, too.

            Courtney Lee (personal) is out for Friday against the Bucks.
        
        
             He should be ready to go for Sunday against the Raptors. Lee did not play on Tuesday against the Blazers, which led to Frank Ntilikina getting his first NBA start next to Emmanuel Mudiay. Those two and Trey Burke were a disaster in that loss on Tuesday, combined for 13 points on 5-of-28 from the field. It's probably best to avoid this situation in fantasy.

             ""If it happens, it happens,"" he said. We'll find out just how much the No. 1 seed means to the Warriors this week with a back-to-back set tonight and Friday. Tonight is a national game, so it makes more sense that they'd sit players against the Blazers tomorrow. Fantasy owners will want to check back tomorrow.

             It's a 10-day deal for Purvis after he had a partially-guaranteed deal back in August. Purvis is more of a scorer at 20.5 points per game in the G League, and he'll provide some depth on the wing. If you wanted to read between the lines, this could mean Evan Fournier (knee) is set to miss games.

             He suffered a wrist injury on Tuesday night when Dante Cunningham pushed Jordan Bell into Iguodala, and he'll be missing the first game of a back-to-back set. Iggy was giving high fives after the injury happened and he didn't look to be hurt right away, so this is likely just a day-to-day thing. With him out, that should mean more Nick Young, Shaun Livingston and possibly more lineups with true centers out there because we won't see the Hampton Five.

             Coach Nate McMillan didn't go into many details, but we know he practiced with the second unit and won't be back in the starting lineup until he gets his conditioning up. He was given a 2-3 week timetable on February 5, so he's obviously behind schedule and that's why Indiana is being extra cautious. If Collison returns, expect heavy restrictions for at least the first couple games. Cory Joseph and Lance Stephenson will lose some value once Collison is cleared.

             The Mavericks are off until Saturday vs. Memphis, so Matthews has another full 48 hours to recover. There's a good chance he plays, but you never know with the Mavs tanking. If Matthews is a go, Yogi Ferrell and J.J. Barea will lose some fantasy appeal.

            The Suns are unlikely to keep Alex Len when he becomes an unrestricted free agent this summer according to Scott Bordow of azcentral sports.
        
        
             Bordow says that Len's offensive limitations and tendency to get into foul trouble makes him a poor fit going forward. His durability can't help his case either. Len has done a fine job as the starting center with 10.0 points, 8.8 rebounds and 2.0 blocks per game, but he's played a combined 14 minutes in his last two outings with Tyson Chandler back.

             ""He’s simplifying things out there,"" Carlisle added. ""It’s pretty clear he’s getting some rhythm back and he’s getting some familiarity with the guys he’s playing with."" Coach Carlisle has kept his word about giving Noel a chance and the big man is coming off a 14-board game with eight points, a steal and a block in 26 minutes. The Mavs are off until Saturday, so if you want to take a flier on him fantasy owners should probably wait another day or two.

We'd expect Jeff Teague's job as the starter to be safe based on Rose's play in recent seasons, and there's no guarantee that he takes Tyus Jones' backup job either. Fantasy owners would be wise to leave Rose on the wire. He's expected to be available on Thursday vs. the Celtics.

             ""I thought those guys [the reserves] earned the right to play,"" Bickerstaff said. ""You know, they cut the lead down. I didn’t want to disrupt the rhythm of that group, so I just let them run."" Gasol left the locker room before it was opened to the media and ""wore headphones and walked by reporters while whistling as he made his way to the team bus."" He's clearly frustrated with the tanking in Memphis and there's a good chance he sits either on Friday vs. the Jazz or Saturday vs. Dallas.

             ""Everybody tells me he is working out eight, nine hours a day, just religiously working out, doing everything they ask of him and more,"" Gorman said. ""It seems to me if Gordon Hayward thought his next basketball game he was going to play in was going to be in next October, he might not be working out nine hours a day right now."" This sounds like pure speculation and coach Brad Stevens has already shot down the idea of Hayward returning this season. We'll continue to list him as out for 2017-18.

             It's hard to argue with that. Not only did James score seven of his 39 points in the final minute of Wednesday's win over the Nuggets, but he's averaging 30.0 points, 9.8 assists and 9.7 rebounds since the Cavaliers shook up their roster at the deadline. He's fourth in the league in points per game, second in the league in assists per game, 17th in rebounds and 21st in steals, and he's yet to miss a single game because he said he wants to lead by example. Life is good for LeBron and his fantasy owners.

             The Joker had been struggling and coach Mike Malone even benched him in the fourth quarter on Monday to send a message. ""I told [Jokic] we need to get him back being a lot more aggressive and stop deferring to everybody,"" Malone said. ""He’s our best player and we need him to step up in these last 18 games."" The recent return of Paul Millsap (wrist) has done Jokic no favors, but tonight's huge line cements our lack of concern. Jokic is a fantasy dynamo.

             Murray sat out late in each of Denver's previous two games, but coach Mike Malone suggested that Murray was sidelined tonight after taking a knee from LeBron James. The good news is that he will not be in the concussion protocol. Murray is still producing late-round value in most formats, and we've seen him go through extended lulls before, so owners should keep the faith.

             The seven shot attempts tied Barton's fewest since Jan. 27. Tonight's game was also the first time he'd gone without a 3-pointer in 10 games, and the rebounds were his fewest since Feb. 5, so there are plenty of reasons to write this off as a fluke.

             Chandler played the final eight minutes tonight, which is a great sign. Nuggets coach Mike Malone said after Monday's loss to the lowly Mavericks, ""If you’re not going to go out there and give it your all, you’re not going to play ... What each player owes is to go out there and play as hard as you can."" Chandler's shots weren't falling tonight, but as long as he's getting 32+ minutes and has the faith of his coach, he should be a reliable fantasy play.

             Brandon Ingram (strained hamstring) is out until at least Mar. 12, which means he'll spend at least two more games on the sidelines -- and it's debatable whether L.A. would play him in back-to-back games on Mar. 13-14. That leaves Kuzma in a terrific position, at least short-term, and his patient owners can safely deploy him in active lineups.

""I hit [my knee] one time coming off a screen,"" Ball said. ""Just had to run it off and keep playing."" He stuffed the stat sheet tonight and has been terrific in four March games, averaging 13.0 points, 3.8 triples, 5.3 rebounds, 6.3 assists, 2.3 steals and 0.8 blocks. He continues to be a drag in percentages, but you already knew that.

             The King went 4-of-8 from the line with three turnovers, but those were the only smirches on an otherwise phenomenal line -- he also shot 15-of-25 from the field.

             Hood has replaced Cedi Osman (three points in 12 minutes) as the starting SF, and it's a move that could stick -- the Cavs have won two straight games since coach Ty Lue made the switch. Even as a starter, Hood is just a low-end fantasy option as a source of scoring and 3-pointers with a trickle of supporting stats.

             The Lakers were on a five-game winning streak before losing to Portland, and coach Luke Walton was committed to maintaining that success. ""We have to regroup, refocus and not let this turn into a losing streak,"" Walton said after the loss. That bodes well for the veteran Thomas, whose role was already solidified with Josh Hart (wrist) out indefinitely. IT didn't get to the FT line tonight, which is a minor disappointment -- he's a combined 32-of-34 since the All-Star break (94.1%), which has buoyed his roto value.

             Vuc made 11-of-18 field goals tonight and this was his highest-scoring game since Dec. 17, just before the hand fracture that sidelined him for roughly six weeks. The 27-year-old center only needs 30+ minutes for early-round value, and his role is solidified with Orlando having no incentive to give minutes to Bismack Biyombo or Marreese Speights.

             Isaac started ahead of Jonathon Simmons for the second half on Monday, but coach Frank Vogel kept him in his usual reserve role tonight. That could change soon, however, since Evan Fournier (knee) got hurt tonight and Vogel indicated that Isaac's minute-limit might be lifted. Don't be surprised if Isaac finds himself starting in the near future, as the Magic shift entirely toward player development, at which point his defensive upside alone would be worth the price of admission.

             He's streaking again with this 10-game streak after he was part of a seven-game streak to start his season with the Bulls. Mirotic continues to hoist treys with 7.7 per game with the Pelicans, averaging 14.8 points, 7.8 boards, 1.3 blocks and 2.4 treys in his previous games with New Orleans. He may have to shoot the ball more if Anthony Davis (ankle) is out, too.

             If Anthony Davis (ankle) is going to miss time, Miller could be looking at a few extra minutes. On the other hand, he's left a lot to be desired on the stat sheet over his last five, averaging 4.8 points, 2.0 boards, 2.2 assists and 1.2 treys. He's only a speculative add in very deep leagues for now.

             The Pelicans have gone 10-2 since Okafor debut, so serious credit to their front office for this pickup. Okafor could be looking at a few extra minutes if Anthony Davis (ankle) needs to miss time, but chances are he likely wouldn't see more than 24 or so. He's only a specialist for blocks in deep leagues.

             Make it four good games in a row for Skal, averaging 12.8 points, 6.5 boards, 2.8 assists, 2.0 blocks and 0.5 treys on 47.8 percent from the field and 81.8 percent from the line over 30.1 minutes per game. Before this stretch, he struggled to even put two good games together, so his consistency speaks volumes. He's been hanging around mid-round value in standard leagues, so he should be owned in 12-team formats.

             He'll get minutes when he's active, but the question will be whether he's rested or not. Randolph didn't play in two of the previous three, which is even worse considering Willie Cauley-Stein is hurt.

             If you missed it, he rolled his left ankle in the third quarter and did not return. Davis did not appear to be on the bench after he limped to the locker room either. He did try to stay in the game at first, but the sprain was clearly bothering him and he went straight to the locker room as he left the court. He'll get Thursday off before Bradley Beal comes to town for Friday. Meanwhile, there isn't a great speculative pickup until we get word on his MRI.

Plus, the Kings having a late start makes it tough to use him in DFS, too.

             Revenge game? Besides that, he could be looking at additional ball-handling responsibility with De'Aaron Fox (back) getting hurt today.  Hield's assists have been down on the year at 1.6 per game, but just about all of his stats are up since the break. He's been hanging around top-100 value in nine-category leagues recently, so he's already been worth owning in most leagues.

             De'Aaron Fox strained his back in the first quarter today, which explains the increase to Mason's playing time. The game before Mason got hurt in January, he played 34 minutes in a start, so maybe he's headed for big minutes until Fox is back.

             The Pistons came in 2-8 in their previous 10 games and they've struggled to get consistent production on the wings, which prompted coach Stan Van Gundy to turn to his prized rookie. ""I’m not worried about [Kennard's] numbers,"" Van Gundy said. ""He’s probably our most skilled wing player. We need him to be aggressive."" Stanley Johnson (back) was out tonight, which opened up the wing rotation, and Kennard is only worth watching if he begins averaging 25+ minutes on a regular basis.

             Bullock barely caught the rim on a wide-open 3-pointer at the end of overtime, but fantasy owners aren't complaining. He's averaging 15.1 points per game since the All-Star break, which is worth admiring -- only 67 players in the league are averaging 15+ points this season. He's a viable fantasy play as long as he's getting substantial minutes and offensive volume.

            Blake Griffin had 31 points, four assists, three rebounds, two assists, one block and three 3-pointers during Wednesday's 121-119 home loss.
        
        
             Griffin sank a 3-pointer to tie the game with 37.2 seconds left in overtime, finishing 12-of-21 from the field and 4-of-8 from the line. Since Blake joined the Pistons, they had been 6-0 vs. opponents on the second night of a back-to-back set -- tonight's loss snapped that streak, but it did come against the Eastern Conference-leading Raptors. Roto owners haven't been thrilled with Griffin's percentages, turnovers and lack of defensive stats in Detroit, but he's getting it done in most points leagues.

             Ennis was bumped from the starting lineup by Luke Kennard, who logged 31 minutes tonight. Ennis came in averaging a modest 9.0 points, 1.1 triples, 2.9 rebounds, 0.7 steals, 0.6 steals and 0.4 blocks with the Pistons, which relegates him to the wire in nearly any format.

             After tonight's tough home loss in overtime, Detroit has won just two of their past dozen games. They're still No. 9 in the East, but sit 5.0 games behind the Heat with 17 games left in their regular season. It's not a good situation in reality, but should give Detroit just enough incentive to prevent any precautionary DNPs for their key veterans.

             Lowry came into this game averaging 5.4 fewer minutes compared to last season, with corresponding dips in scoring (-6.1 points per game), 3-pointers (-0.3), assists (-0.5) and steals (-0.3). The biggest issue is that he's shooting 41.9% from the field, compared to 46.4% last season, but his unique fantasy value is still evident -- tonight's line was the first time all season that a player has notched at least 15 assists, seven rebounds and four steals in a game. Throw in a mere three DNPs this season, and his owners should be satisfied.

             JV hit 6-of-13 shots with one 3-pointer in one of his most well-rounded lines of the season. There were plenty of extenuating circumstances -- the matchup worked in his favor (vs. a true center in Andre Drummond), the Raptors lost Serge Ibaka to an ejection in the first half, and this game went to overtime. Nevertheless, he's an automatic start with Toronto in the midst of a favorable stretch of busy four-game weeks.

             Siakam's fantasy value hinges on his ability to chip in defensive stats and we're not reading into tonight's line -- Ibaka will play his usual role on Friday, which limits Siakam to deep-league ownership. As a footnote, he did make his first 3-pointer in three weeks tonight, snapping an 0-of-7 slump from long distance.

             Poeltl had blocked at least one shot in 13 consecutive games, and he came in averaging 2.7 swats since the All-Star break. Owners relying on him for specialist appeal should stay the course, with the understanding that low playing time makes him susceptible to occasional duds.

             Toronto clawed their way back from an early double-digit deficit, and DeRozan had clutch and-one baskets at the end of both regulation and overtime. The Pistons missed Stanley Johnson (back spasms) defensively tonight and had no answers for DeMar, who continues to quietly put up top-50 value in 8-cat and 9-cat formats -- he's even better in most points leagues.

             Nothing ruins your tank plans like the Grizzlies coming to town. Even with the NBA warning the Bulls about resting healthy players, Dunn should still be fine as the starter and he talked about winning games after this victory. ""We got to find a way to build that chemistry,"" Dunn said. ""It starts now. Don’t try to wait too long. Try to get it going now and let it resonate through the summer and try to come back and try to be better."" He should be busy for the last mont of the season.

             Delon Wright (sprained toe) and OG Anunoby (ankle) were both out of commission tonight, and Powell took advantage to score more points than he had in the previous nine games combined. Anunoby (ankle) didn't travel with the team for this road game and his return date is unclear, which sets the stage for more potential starts from Powell. Still, most owners should wait to see him reproduce this line before cutting anyone of value for him.

            Anthony Davis (left ankle) went to the locker room in the third quarter on Wednesday.
        
        
             He stepped on Kosta Koufos' foot to cause his foot to roll. Davis tried to walk it off and stayed in the game for a possession, but he checked out and hobbled to the locker room under his own power. Considering the Pelicans are up 20, he may be held out.

            David Nwaba moved to the bench against the Grizzlies on Wednesday, scoring eight points with four rebounds, one assist and one turnover in 24 minutes.
        
        
             While he did play more than Justin Holiday's 17 minutes, Nwaba's six-game streak of hitting 30 minutes was snapped today. With the NBA warning the Bulls to ease up on their rest, Nwaba is likely going to be closer to 24 minutes and not the 32.0 per game he had since the break. He'll probably have a tough time holding top-100 value with the minutes hit, but he's still somewhat fantasy friendly for hustle stats.

             He'll probably be moving out of the rotation on Friday with Brook Lopez set to start. Felicio has been one of the worst defensive bigs in the NBA, so this move would likely hurt the Bulls tank mode.

             The lineup tweak didn't affect Payne and he looks to be ahead of Jerian Grant for the foreseeable future. Payne has actually been decent with 1.6 steals per game over his last five, but he's not scoring well and doesn't do much else. He's more of a desperation streamer.

             He played a nine-minute stint in the first quarter and an eight-minute stint in the third for all of his playing time. Holiday got hot early with nine points in his first eight minutes, and had his jumper working in limited playing time. He's expected to start again on Friday night, but he's likely looking at around 17 minutes again. Considering that is half of his average from before the break, Holiday doesn't look like much of an add.

            Marc Gasol was benched down the stretch of Wednesday's 119-110 loss in Chicago, finishing with 17 points, seven assists and six rebounds in 27 minutes.
        
        
             Jarell Martin (knee) and Chandler Parsons (personal) joined the parade of DNPs for Memphis tonight, and the 2017-18 season can't end soon enough for the Grizzlies or their fans. The team has shown no inclination to shut down Gasol outright, but there's a good chance he'll miss games during back-to-back sets on Mar. 21-22 and Apr. 8-9. Plan accordingly.

             Brooks also played 28 minutes without a single turnover tonight, and he's scored 20+ points in two straight games for the short-handed Grizzlies. The second-round pick hasn't offered many supporting stats this season, and percentages have been an issue, but he's at least worth a look with Memphis turning him loose at the end of a lost season.

             The Grizzlies are in the midst of a 15-game losing streak and they were missing four primary ball-handlers, so it's no surprise to see Rathan-Mayes getting serious run off the bench. He's averaging 6.0 assists over the past two games, which alone merits fantasy owners' attention -- assists are in rare supply on the waiver wire, so feel free to grab him if you need dimes. Just don't get too attached.

             Simmons is essentially the default starting PG with so many injured guards, and he joined a lineup that included Ben McLemore, Dillon Brooks, JaMychal Green and Marc Gasol. Heavy minutes will be coming his way until Memphis gets some healthy players back, so feel free to deploy him if you need a cheap source of scoring with uncertain upside.

             Green came in with six straight double-doubles and he wasn't a total disappointment tonight, going 5-of-6 from the field with just one turnover in 27 minutes. He did get benched down the stretch, along with Marc Gasol, and at age 27 he's one of the elder statesman on a tanking team. There's some risk involved but fantasy owners might as well keep him active unless his minutes fall off.

             He scored 21 points in the first half to give him a whopping 25 games with at least 20 points in a half on the season. The Rockets continue to coast with their 17th-straight victory, and they're an incredible 34-1 when Harden, Chris Paul and Clint Capela all suit up for a game. Their streak will be tested in Toronto on Friday night, so you'll want to tune in for that one. Harden basically has MVP locked up at this point.

             McLemore missed Monday's game and his availability was welcome news for a decimated Grizzlies team without guards Mike Conley, Mario Chalmers, Andrew Harrison and Tyreke Evans. He did commit six turnovers in 38 minutes tonight, but most owners will happily accept that caveat for solid across-the-board production from a waiver-wire scrub. The Grizzlies' injury woes aren't going away any time soon, making McLemore a reasonable pickup if you're in need of a scoring guard.

             This was a small-ball fest and Mbah a Moute continues to thrive in that role as an undersized five man. He's also been pretty decent in fantasy over his last five, averaging 10.8 points, 3.2 boards, 0.8 blocks and 1.2 treys on 70.4 percent from the field and 90.9 percent from the line. He's still more of a guy to stream in season-long leagues, but he has decent value until Ryan Anderson is back.

             He was used at center more than usual in this game and that combo may be used more as Jabari Parker sees more run. Antetokounmpo took some bumps in this game, including a Clint Capela elbow to his chin. On the whole, Antetokounmpo is back to his stat-stuffing ways since the break, averaging 4.9 dimes, 2.3 blocks, 1.9 steals and 0.7 treys in his previous outings since the All-Star Game. His efficiency is slightly down, but his owners can't complain. The Bucks are 3-7 in their last 10 games and sit in the No. 8 spot.

             He still seems to be stuck at the minutes limit in the mid 20s, and he didn't get key minutes late in this game. Part of that could be due to defensive play, but either way he should start to get closer to 30 minutes soon. Although, Parker isn't really doing much besides score with a few boards here and there, so he is likely just going to be a later-round fantasy guy going forward.

             Tyler Zeller didn't play and Thon Maker was a DNP-CD in this game, so the Bucks went with a ton of no-C lineups. The matchup was obviously a factor, but the Bucks will likely be looking to go with more Giannis Antetokounmpo at the five. Henson has been fairly quiet since the break, so he's a drop candidate in most leagues.

             The minutes were a big bump from just 18 minutes combined in his last two, and it was likely matchup based against the high-powered Rockets. Brown took a few minutes away from Jabari Parker and John Henson in this one, so that probably won't continue most nights. He's not really an add in even deep leagues.

             He went to the locker room just about one minute before this announcement, so the Kings didn't waste any time to rule him out. He was in some discomfort as he went to the locker room and Fox continues to suffer these smaller injuries. He should be considered doubtful to play on Friday, which could mean Garrett Temple and Frank Mason get more run. Mason is worth a speculative add in deeper leagues.

             Favors resumed his usual starting job alongside Rudy Gobert, with Jonas Jerebko heading back to the second unit.

Considering his health issues in recent years, that's already a big win for everyone who drafted him.

Favors was back in action tonight, however, so Jerebko's role took a predictable dive -- prior to Monday's game, he'd scored double-digit points just three times since Dec. 1.

The supporting stats have been there all along, so it's great to see him staying aggressive offensively.

He's been one of the more unlikely top-50 values over the past month.

             Oladipo had 10 turnovers during Monday's game, to go along with 14 points on 5-of-19 shooting. The good news is that he salvaged tonight's line with seven assists, five steals, three rebounds and one block in 34 minutes. He also gets a delectable matchup vs. the Hawks' defense on Friday, so this mini-slump isn't likely to last another game.

             The sharp-shooting forward has been on fire lately and he was coming off a season-high-tying 29-point eruption vs. the Bucks on Monday. Bogdanovic went scoreless in a game on Jan. 29, but since he's hit double-digits in every game since. ""I was really, really pissed off [about the scoreless game] ... I just tried to tell myself that I have to be aggressive,"" he said. The message has obviously been received and he's rolling as a mid-round fantasy value since the All-Star break.

            The Pacers' three-game win streak was snapped on Wednesday, despite Myles Turner putting up 24 points, four rebounds, three blocks and one assist.
        
        
             Turner made 10-of-14 FGs and 3-of-4 FTs, with one 3-pointer and just one turnover in 30 minutes of action. Considering the difficult circumstances -- a blowout loss vs. a surging Jazz team -- it's hard to ask for more from Turner for fantasy purposes. He was coming off a 1-of-3 shooting dud on Monday, and hopefully this will give him some elusive momentum for the season's final weeks.

             Booker wasn't expected to play more than 10 minutes tonight, as he got his feet wet in coach Nate McMillan's rotations. It'll take a few games to see exactly where his playing time comes from, but presumably T.J. Leaf will fall out of the rotation with Thaddeus Young and Domantas Sabonis potentially giving up a few minutes also. Regardless, Booker isn't a fantasy asset.

With him out, it'll be Norman Powell, Malcolm Miller and Fred VanVleet getting a few extra minutes. Pascal Siakam also started the third quarter for the ejected Serge Ibaka.

On the plus side, he'll be very well rested for Friday's showdown with the visiting Rockets.

             Despite OG Anunoby (ankle) going down, Powell hasn't seen much of a boost in value regardless of how he enters the game, so it's tough to trust him in most leagues.

             This will be Nene's standard rest day on the second night of a back-to-back, and with Ryan Anderson (hip) and Brandan Wright (knee) also unavailable, Clint Capela could be logging heavy minutes tonight. Nene will be back in action for Friday's game in Toronto.

             In case you missed it yesterday, he took a shot to his ribs in the first half and X-rays were negative, but returned for the second half with 31 points to get him to 41 total. Davis is on an epic heater right now and should be in for another monster game tonight.RotoGrinders.com Daily Slant: For those concerned about pulling the trigger on Davis on a B2B with a minor injury scare, he's absolutely dominated in his last two B2Bs, posting an average just shy of 94 FPs. He's continued to be a usage hog with DeMarcus Cousins out and that doesn't figure to change with the Pelicans playing well, so Davis once again is an elite upside target.

Iguodala hasn't played in both games of a back-to-back set since January, and hopefully it's just a precaution. Nick Young and Shaun Livingston could be looking at a few extra minutes.

Ellington's return should take minutes from Winslow and Rodney McGruder, and Ellington's chances to score will likely drop now that Dwyane Wade is playing well in the second unit.

            Pau Gasol (shoulder) will not play against the Warriors on Thursday.
        
        
             Tony Parker dropped a hint that Gasol's shoulder injury was ""bad"" and Gasol did not practice on Wednesday. With Gasol out, it'll likely be Joffrey Lauvergne and Davis Bertans picking up a few extra minutes. Considering the Spurs stance on injuries, it's possible Gasol misses more time, so he's a drop candidate in fantasy leagues.

             He would likely start over Jonathon Simmons after Isaac started the second half over him on Monday. Isaac is expected to have a minutes limit for another week, but he's been effective in limited playing time with a combined four steals and six blocks over his last three. The Magic do play three games in the next  four nights, so adding Isaac makes sense if you're looking for some extra defensive stats until Saturday. He's worth a look in 14-team leagues overall, too.

             He was listed as questionable yesterday due to knee soreness, but apparently Labissiere is feeling better today. The second-year forward is off to a solid start to his post-break run, averaging 11.6 points, 5.1 boards, 1.7 assists, 1.6 blocks and 0.4 steals in those seven games. He's worth owning in standard leagues right now and hopefully he can keep up the consistency.RotoGrinders.com Daily Slant: With Skal now considered probable, the DFS upside of all three Kings bigs - Randolph and Koufos in addition to Skal - comes down some. Sacramento's rotations are about as unpredictable as any in the league, but it's worth noting that Randolph did rest on Sunday which gives him a nice shot to upend Koufos in terms of minutes, and it's not out of the question that Koufos sits out entirely in order to rest. If that happens, Skal and Randolph would become elite targets.

While this is an encouraging quote from Kawhi, it's worth noting that he still wasn't able to practice in full on Wednesday, and ""soon"" without an official return date is a painfully vague description. He's fine to stash away if you've got an open IR-spot, but know that he'll likely have heavy restrictions upon his return and that back-to-back sets will likely be out of the question.

""It’s hard to say you’re fully back when you don’t really have the proper rest and the proper tools to get there. You just have to work with what you have."" Russell has been better over the past month, but efficiency and turnover issues remain a problem for the third-year guard.

             Booker is slated to make his Pacers' debut tonight, but 10 minutes of floor time won't be enough for him to make a meaningful impact in fantasy hoops. He'll likely take away some run from Domantas Sabonis and Thaddeus Young, but Booker belongs on the waiver wire in all leagues.

My first thought was to get Rondae into the starting lineup, but we’ll see how that evolves. We’ve got to get a better sample size to get a grip where we’re going to go permanently."" RHJ is still worth owning as a reserve player, but his value would be much improved as a starter.

             This was Green's first game of more than 11 points in his last four, but his rebounds, assists and steals have been stellar all year. Green got his dunk attempt blocked by Joe Harris, and will surely be catching some heat from his teammates about it, as it was a pretty amazing play by Harris. Despite his lack of scoring, Green is still returning early third-round fantasy value this season.

             He started the second half in place of Wes Johnson and finished with a +/- rating of +16 in the 5-point loss, adding eight rebounds, two assists and one steal. This was the third-highest scoring game of his career and Harrell has been very productive recently, averaging 18.6 points, 4.6 rebounds, 1.8 assists, 0.6 blocks and 0.8 steals in 23.0 minutes over his last five. If Harrell moves into the starting lineup (Tobias Harris could slide to SF) or continues to see minutes in the 20s, he'll be worth an add if you can live with his free throw shooting.

             He was a little iffy coming in with a sprained ankle, but it obviously wasn't a problem. Curry's scored between 21 and 44 points in his last six games and the Warriors have won all six of them, which is being lost in the bustle of the Rockets (16) and Pelicans (9) winning streaks. The Warriors are still the champs and are probably happy to give up the spotlight to the Rockets right now, after being under a lot of pressure the last few years to set regular-season records. Draymond Green, Kevin Durant and Klay Thompson, as usual, were all effective in tonight's win.

His minutes have been down a bit with Caris LeVert coming on, but the problem appears to be more related to Crabbe's ineffective shooting than the emergence of LeVert.

             He bounced back nicely from his six-point game on Sunday and has played very well in three of his last four games. The Nets have no reason to keep playing their veteran studs, but they keep doing it. DAR could get a rest at any time, but he's looking good and playing well, so just keep rolling him out there until further notice.

            Anthony Davis returned from a rib contusion to score 41 points in a 121-116 win over the Clippers on Tuesday.
        
        
             He needed X-rays at halftime, but came back and dropped 31 points in the second half and hit a clutch fadeaway jumper to give the Pelicans a two-point cushion with 30 seconds left. He finished 17-of-31 from the field and 3-of-3 from the line to go with 13 rebounds, two assists, three steals, three blocks and four triples in 37 minutes. He has eight games with 40+ points this season and six of those have come after the DeMarcus Cousins injury. He's the best player in fantasy basketball at the moment and it's not close, but owners will want to make sure he's playing on Wednesday night. When asked if he'll play on Wednesday against the Kings, Davis said ""We'll see at 7:00 o'clock."" Stay tuned.

             We give up. He was showing serious signs of life, scoring 18, 13 and 15 points in three straight with solid boards and some blocks, then disappeared in his last two games, totaling just 11 points, five rebounds and one block in them. He wasn't in foul trouble in either game, but he wasn't engaged in the offense, either. Allen still has plenty of time to start going off, but he's been more of a headache than anything this season. He'll get Dwight Howard on Thursday night and anything is possible, but if you have options, Allen is not a must-start player right now, and he's barely clinging to must-own status.

             Despite the Nets having nothing to play for, they're effectively losing games (albeit competitively) with Carroll out there, and he's kind of on fire, averaging 19 points, 7.2 boards, 3.0 assists, 0.6 steals and 3.6 3-pointers on 52 percent shooting over his last five games. The run could come to a halt at any time, but he's been killing it, and should be in all fantasy starting lineups until further notice.

             This game sums up why he's a toxic fantasy player. Mudiay has been so bad that coach Jeff Hornacek has considered putting Jarrett Jack back in the rotation, but it sounds like he will continue to prioritize ""development"" for now. His job is far from safe, though.

Keep an eye on him to see if he can string a few good games together.

             He was 2-of-7 from the field and was quiet on offense, but he did have some great moments on defense. He'll need to hit the 3-point shot more consistently if he's going to play off the ball and coach Jeff Hornacek expects that to happen sooner rather than later. ""He’s got the length to shoot over guys. So he’s going to be just fine,"" Hornacek said. ""He’s got to go back in the summer and continue working. He’s going to be a dynamite shooter."" We'll see what happens when Courtney Lee (personal) comes back, but it makes sense for the Knicks to play the rookie as much as possible. He's not a standard-league pickup.

             He was already dealing with a left ankle sprain and some back problems, so this is officially his third different injury he's dealing with.

Harrell has been a per-minute monster lately and would be very intriguing if he had a larger role. He's making a strong case for more playing time tonight.

             He had 10 points and two 3-pointers in his previous game and is benefitting from the absence of Wesley Matthews (hip), while Yogi Ferrell scored a season-high 24 tonight. McDermott is worth keeping an eye on in deep leagues, but he'll need for Matthews to continue to rest and for Ferrell to crawl back into his hole for it to come to fruition.

             Barea's line would have looked much better had he hit some shots, but he's finally starting to cool off for the Mavs. Over his last three games, off the bench, he's averaging 8.7 points, 3.3 boards, 4.3 assists and 2.0 3-pointers. That's a far cry from his five-game averages of 16.8 points, 3.0 rebounds, 10.0 assists, 0.8 steals and 3.0 3-pointers a week ago. Yogi Ferrell and Dennis Smith Jr. appear to be coming on for the Mavericks, which could be bad news for Barea down the stretch.

             He came through against Nikola Jokic, who was benched down the stretch, but this was really one of the first solid games he's played since opening night. If he continues to get heavy minutes the rest of the way, Noel could make some noise for the Mavs, so think about taking a flier on him if you're hurting at center. But be prepared to be disappointed, as he's had a lost season up to this point. We'd still rather own Dwight Powell for now.

Did we mention that the Nuggets are in ninth place and fighting for a playoff spot? Yikes.

             Ferrell hadn't scored more than nine points in his previous four games, but shot it lights-out tonight and was largely responsible for the Mavs getting the unlikely win over one of the league's hottest teams. With nothing left to play for, the Mavs could just turn Yogi loose the rest of the way, making him at least worth a look going forward. But just beware that his scoring lines in his previous four games were 5, 2, 4 and 9.

             Coach Michael Malone has done things like this in the past and isn't exactly loved by the fantasy community. What makes this benching even worse is that the Nuggets are sitting in 9th place with the Thunder, Clippers and Jazz all within a couple games of each other. Jokic added nine rebounds with five assists, one block and two steals and has seen his production fall off a cliff since Paul Millsap returned. Malone even said on Monday that his offense still revolves around Jokic, but that wasn't the case tonight.

            Kelly Oubre (foot) played through his injury on Tuesday vs. the Heat, scoring 14 points in 28 minutes.
        
        
             He hit all six of his free throws and 3-of-8 shots, adding one rebound, one assist, two steals and two triples. Oubre's foot has been bothering him for a while, but it's likely a wear-and-tear issue because an MRI came back clean. Otto Porter tweaked his troublesome right hip in the win, so Oubre may be asked to step up. In 10 fill-in starts this season, Oubre put up 10.9 points, 5.1 rebounds, 1.1 assists, 0.9 steals and 1.8 triples.

             The Thunder are currently the No. 7 seed, but sit just 1.0 games ahead of the No. 8 Clippers (In action right now) and No. 9 Nuggets, and just 2.0 games ahead of the streaking No. 10 Jazz. The good news for Thunder fans is that they get the Suns on Thursday, the banged-up Spurs on Saturday, then the Kings on Monday and Hawks on Tuesday. They'll need to win those games, as things tighten up with the Clippers, Raptors, Celtics, Heat, Blazers, Spurs and Nuggets to close out March. The Thunder clearly have their work cut out for them if they're going to make the playoffs, as April doesn't look any better: They finish the season at New Orleans, vs. Golden State, at Houston, at Miami and at home against the Grizzlies on the final day of the season. Yikes!

             Morris logged 42 minutes in the overtime win and played some small-ball center as well, hitting 6-of-12 shots and 2-of-3 free throws. He's starting to get into a rhythm with at least 12 points in each of his last five games, averaging 14.6 points, 7.6 rebounds, 2.6 assists, 0.8 blocks, 0.6 steals and 1.8 triples in that span. He's one of those guys that is hard to get excited about on your roster but is too good to be on the wire. He'll get a matchup vs. the Pelicans on Friday.

             The day off apparently did him some good, as he had failed to score more than 14 points in his previous three games. His lack of peripheral stats tonight was disappointing, but at least he scored and hit some threes. The No. 7 Thunder are clinging to playoff life right now, sitting just a game ahead of the No. 8 Clippers and No. 9 Nuggets, with the red-hot No. 10 Jazz just 2.0 games back, so they'll need to continue to get strong play from Melo down the stretch.

            Tomas Satoransky scored 19 points (6-of-12 FGs, 6-of-8 FTs) with seven assists, three rebounds, one steal and one triple in Tuesday's overtime win vs. Miami.
        
        
             Satoransky was one of three Wizards to log 40+ minutes (Bradley Beal and Markieff Morris), yet another indication of how much coach Scott Brooks trusts him. John Wall (knee) has progressed to light shooting and could be back at some point next week, but Satoranksy surely has earned himself a significant role in this rotation when the Wizards are back at full strength -- Satorasnky has led the Wizards to an 11-6 record since Wall went down.

             Batum's scoring leaves something to be desired, as he just doesn't take a lot of shots, but he's hot, scoring in double figures in three straight games and five of his last six, and racking up at least seven assists in nine straight games. He's averaging 10.6 points, 7.0 rebounds, 9.6 assists, 1.4 steals and 1.4 3-pointers over his last five, despite shooting just 38 percent over that stretch. He was a bit disappointing throughout much of the season, but has really turned it on of late.

             Beal dished out seven assists with six rebounds and six triples with four turnovers. He played a game-high 43 minutes in the win and came into tonight's game tied with Anthony Davis and LeBron James for the most minutes per game (37.9) since John Wall went down. Coach Scott Brooks said that ideally he'd like to keep Beal around 36 minutes, but it doesn't sound like he has any rest days planned for the SG. Beal has admitted to being tired, but now he gets a few days off before Friday's game vs. the Pelicans.

I'll go to my grave - and I will go to my grave - with Dwyane Wade shooting with the game on the line,"" coach Erik Spoelstra said after the game. His move back to Miami has rejuvenated him and he already has three games with 20+ points in 10 games for the Heat compared to just three such games in 46 appearances for the Cavs.

             Embiid dominated Dwight Howard on Friday with 23 points, 15 rebounds, four assists, three steals and a 3-pointer, but Howard turned the tables on him tonight, going off for 30 points, six boards, a steal, three blocks and a 3-pointer. Embiid has played in 10 straight games and the Sixers don't have a back-to-back set until March 15-16. It's possible he finishes out the season for the Sixers, but it would make sense for them to take it easy on him, as the No. 6 Sixers appear to be locked into the playoffs. Starters Dario Saric, Robert Covington, Ben Simmons and J.J. Redick all joined Embiid in double figures in the win.

             Coach Erik Spoelstra's rotations are all over the place and Johnson played just 18 minutes on Monday, but his workload should be in the high 20s most nights. While not the most consistent player, Johnson usually gets the job done for fantasy owners even as a reserve and is flirting with top-100 value in 9-category leagues on the season. He'll stay in that range unless Goran Dragic or Josh Richardson ever needs to miss time.

            Robert Covington hit 7-of-11 shots and five 3-pointers for 22 points, four rebounds, two assists, two steals and two blocks, and also hit 3-of-3 free throws in Tuesday's 128-114 win over the Hornets.
        
        
             RoCo had 16 points on 5-of-10 shooting on Friday, and is finally shooting it better, hitting 19-of-39 (49%) shots over his last four games. It's worth a look to see if he was dropped in your league, as his poor shooting had fantasy owners in despair in many cases. He's hot, averaging 14.3 points, 5.3 rebounds, 2.0 steals, 1.3 blocks and 3.0 3-pointers over those four games. He will likely go into another slump any day now, but he's playing much better than he did in January and February right now.

             He was benched at halftime and never came back in. There's a good chance he falls completely out of the rotation when Wayne Ellington (thigh) gets back because his floor spacing won't be needed.

             He was on fire coming into tonight's game, averaging 12.2 points, 6.0 rebounds, 2.8 assists, 2.2 steals and 1.4 triples over his last five while shooting 53.5% from the field and 7-of-12 from beyond the arc. ""Just finally catching a rhythm, finding my spots in the flow of the offense and staying aggressive,"" Winslow said of his strong play. His minutes and production are both trending in the right direction and he's too hot to leave on the wire, but he won't be able to sustain these shooting percentages.

             He was iffy coming in, but was able to go. He also looked better than he has recently, as he scored a grand total of just eight points over his previous three games. He's not really worth owning and now that the Hornets have fallen 7.0 games out of the final playoff spot in the East, they could easily turn to Frank Kaminsky down the stretch.

             He had two nine-point games earlier in the season, but had scored in double figures in 36 straight before tonight's super-dud. Walker also missed 3-of-6 free throws and it was tough to see this one coming, as he had scored at least 23 in his previous four games. His shot just wasn't falling and the size of Ben Simmons, who just missed a triple-double for the Sixers, might have been too much for Walker tonight. He'll try to right the ship on Thursday against the Nets.

             Dwight was trying to show off for Joel Embiid after being dominated by him on Friday and easily outdueled the young big man tonight. But he also picked up his 14th technical foul of the season tonight, putting him just two away from an automatic one-game suspension, assuming tonight's isn't rescinded. Howard's having a fantastic season for the Hornets and tonight's game was nearly flawless. He'll try to teach Jarrett Allen a few things on Thursday when the Hornets play the Nets. Additionally, the Hornets fell a full 7.0 games out of the final playoff spot in the East, so it might not take much of an injury to Dwight for them to give him some time off. Just keep an eye on the situation, as the Hornets don't appear to ready to give up just yet.

            Otto Porter has been diagnosed with a bruised right hip and is considered day-to-day.
        
        
             He took a shot to the hip in the fourth quarter, went back to the locker and wasn't able to return in the overtime win vs. Miami on Tuesday. Any time we see Porter suffer a hip injury it's concerning because of his history with them, but hopefully he dodged a bullet here. For now, we'll consider him questionable for Friday's game vs. the Pelicans, but at least he gets a few days off. Kelly Oubre and Markieff Morris will pick up the slack if Porter can't go. Porter finished with 12 points, five rebounds, five assists, one steal, one block and two triples.

             Lowry essentially took the night off without actually taking the night off. DeMar DeRozan and Jonas Valanciunas did the heavy lifting for the Raptors, who blew the game open by winning the fourth quarter 30-13. While Lowry hasn't been scoring a ton of points lately, he has been putting up very effective numbers, and the Raps knew it wouldn't take much to beat the Hawks at home tonight. Lowry left the court with about a minute left in tonight's game, but there are no reports of an injury. Look for him to bring his A Game Wednesday against the Pistons.

            Taurean Prince hit 3-of-6 shots and two 3-pointers for nine points, eight rebounds, three assists, a steal and two blocks in 29 minutes of Tuesday's 106-90 loss to the Raptors.
        
        
             John Collins also played 29 minutes, but wasn't much better, hitting 6-of-12 shots for three rebounds, three assists and a steal. Both of these guys are equal parts frustration and potential, and still haven't fully broken loose for the Hawks. But the tank is on, these guys are locked into big minutes the rest of the way, and they can only get better from here.

             In other words, the Warriors are resting the veteran forward. Jordan Bell and Kevon Looney are the candidates to pick up a few extra minutes.

             Coach Steve Kerr has talked about using him at both the four and five, so maybe he picks up some run with David West (arm) sitting out. Bell isn't worth owning in standard leagues unless he can carve out a 20-minute role.

             He checked out with 4:14 left in the fourth quarter, but the game was well over by that point. Wright finished with 10 points, three rebounds, one assist, one block and three steals in 18 minutes. This was his first productive game in a while and Fred VanVleet's strong play is the reason he hasn't been playing much.

             He's only averaging 14.9 minutes per game this season, so his return means Nikola Mirotic (back to the bench) and Cheick Diallo will lose a few minutes. Okafor isn't a fantasy option outside of the deepest of leagues.

             He hasn't played since Jan. 20 and there was even some talk about Evans needing offseason surgery. He's unlikely to play much unless the Clippers fall out of the playoff race.

             He went down in obvious pain, but he briefly carried on before heading back to the locker room during a timeout. Porter has a long history with hip injuries, so hopefully it's nothing serious. He checked out in the fourth quarter, so we should have an update soon.

             He's had a tough time staying healthy this season but at least it's not his troublesome shoulder. Labissiere is starting to play really well and is averaging 12.3 points, 7.3 rebounds, 2.3 assists and 2.3 blocks over his last three games, so fantasy owners should hold him for now unless you're in a tight spot. With Willie Cauley-Stein already ruled out, expect to see a lot of Zach Randolph and Kosta Koufos if Skal can't go.

             The rookie will make his first career start with Courtney Lee out for personal reasons. The Knicks are grooming Ntilikina as a shooting guard and it wouldn't be surprising if he held onto the starting job with a nice game tonight. Most fantasy owners should use a wait-and-see approach here because Ntilikina's offense is still coming along. He should be a good source of dimes and steals, though.

Jonas Jerebko started in his place on Monday with 12 points, four rebounds, one steal and three triples, while Ekpe Udoh entered the rotation and played 11 minutes with five rebounds and three blocks.

            Ryan Anderson (hip) said he plans to give his hip a ""more extensive test"" Wednesday in Milwaukee. It is doubtful that he will play Wednesday vs. the Bucks, but he's ""hopeful"" he'll return Friday vs. Toronto.
        
        
             Anderson has already been ruled out of Tuesday's game vs. OKC and has not suited up since February 25th. However, it appears he is making progress and is inching closer to a return. Trevor Ariza, Luc Mbah a Moute, and P.J. Tucker will continue to divvy up extra minutes in Anderson's absence.

            Justin Holiday will be a part of the rotation to close out the season.
        
        
             The NBA reportedly issued a warning to the Bulls this week regarding resting healthy players, so Robin Lopez and Holiday will be more involved in the rotation moving forward. It's unlikely that Holiday will be earning enough minutes to matter, though, so he can remain on the waiver wire in most leagues.

            According to Shams Charania of Yahoo, the NBA issued a warning to the Bulls on resting healthy players and the team now plans to play Robin Lopez and Justin Holiday more extensively to close the season.
        
        
             Lopez started each of the Bulls first 57 games this season, but has not played a single minute since the All-Star break. That will change after commissioner Adam Silver put his foot down in attempt to prevent teams from blatantly tanking. While Lopez will obviously see in his playing time increase, he likely won't see anywhere close to the 27.7 minutes he was averaging over the first half of the season. Thus, he can be left on waivers in most standard-sized leagues for now. He may be worth a look in deeper leagues.  Rolo's return will cut into the playing time of Cristiano Felicio and Bobby Portis.

Over New York's last five games, Lee is averaging just 7.4 points and 1.2 rebounds in 18.2 minutes per contest. Depending on whether the Knicks decide to go big or small vs. the Blazers, Frank Ntilikina or Troy Williams could see an uptick in minutes on Tuesday. It's also possible that Damyean Dotson gets back in the rotation.

             The Grizzlies continue to rule out Evans a full day in advance, which suggests he's not all that close. There's just zero incentive to rush Evans along in the recovery process with Memphis playing for Ping-Pong balls, so it's quite possible that he won't be available when the fantasy playoffs begin. If you're fighting for a post-season spot and don't have an open IR-spot, cutting Evans is an option.

             Oubre did not play Sunday and coach Scott Brooks told reporters that Oubre's foot had been bothering him for several days. Fortunately, the MRI came back clean. This is a situation to keep an eye on moving forward. We'll see how he moves and how many minutes he plays vs. Miami Tuesday night.

             ""[He] moved around pretty good. Not a lot of reps, got a good sweat,"" said Scott Brooks of Wall's first workout since going under the knife in late-January. ""Good workout. That’s another step in the progress in his return, see how he feels tomorrow."" If all goes well, Wall's earliest possible return date would be on March 13 for a home game against the Timberwolves. He's worth stashing if you've got an open IR-spot.

             Williams was unable to participate in shootaround and was listed as questionable heading into this contest. Williams has been struggling of late, averaging just 2.7 points over Charlotte's last three games. Frank Kaminsky could see an uptick in minutes if Williams has his evening cut short due to the migraine. This is a situation to avoid from a fantasy perspective.

Coach Dwane Casey has said that OG Anunoby (knee) will be reinserted back into the starting lineup once he is healthy. Miller should be left on waivers.

             This will be the second straight game on the sidelines for Matthews, who had missed just one of the Mavs first 60 contests this season. It is not surprising that Dallas is playing it safe with Matthews, as they are in Tank Mode and have no reason to rush him back. Doug McDermott was the primary beneficiary of Matthews' absence in Sunday's game. Dougie McBuckets scored 10 points and logged a team-high 34 minutes off the bench.

             MCW sprained his shoulder in the first half of Sunday's loss to the Sixers. He played the second half with a brace. However, he has already been ruled out Tuesday's game vs. Philly. Coach Steve Clifford said that the Hornets would determine a timetable for his return after a decision is made on whether or not to have surgery or address the injury through rehab. Coach Cliff said that Malik Monk would see additional minutes on Tuesday. MCW belongs on waivers.

             Matthews was sidelined for Sunday's game against the Pelicans. It was only the second game he has missed all season. With the Mavericks looking to improve their lottery position over the final five weeks of the season, they have no real motivation to bring Matthews back until he is 100 percent healthy. Doug McDermott logged a team-high 34 minutes off the bench on Sunday and would likely be in line for extended minutes again on Tuesday is Matthews is ruled out.

Hornacek did say that he would continue to find plenty of minutes for Trey Burke and Frank Ntilikina.

Kaminsky has been surprisingly unproductive in his previous starts this season. He has started four games and is averaging 9.8 points (on 39.4 percent shooting) 3.8 rebounds and 2.8 assists in 25.8 minutes over those contests. Treveon Graham will back up Kaminsky if Williams is sidelined.

             Monk has struggled through an awful rookie season and has been a DNP-CD in each of the Hornets previous two contests. On the year, Monk (who was selected two picks ahead of Donovan Micthell in the 2017 draft) is averaging 4.5 points and 1.1 assists in 11.4 minutes per contest, while shooting just 32.3 percent from the floor. The Hornets will likely look to get Monk extended playing time over the final five weeks of the season, but he should still be left on waivers in standard fantasy leagues.

The Blazers have a one-game lead on the Pelicans, Spurs and Timberwolves for the No. 3 seed in the West and are going to try to win every night out in hopes of grabbing home-court advantage in at least the first round of the playoffs.

             CJM uncharacteristically missed 5-of-13 free throws, including two straight with a 106-103 lead that would have sealed the game for the Blazers with seven seconds left. McCollum and Damian Lillard (especially Lillard) got hot in the fourth quarter and scored most of the Blazers' points, as they were able to grab their sixth straight win since the All-Star break.

             Nurk Alert is averaging 14.4 points, 10.2 rebounds, 0.8 steals and 1.0 blocks on 52 percent shooting over his last five games, all Blazers wins. In fact, they're one of the NBA's hottest teams, winning six straight since the All-Star break and clinging to the No. 3 seed in the West. As long as Nurkic is healthy and the Blazers are fighting for playoff position, he should be ready to finish up very strong in Portland.

             His lone missed free throw was massive, as he had a chance to cut the Blazers' lead to one point and get the ball back with seven seconds remaining. However, he missed the free throw, and then had his 3-pointer blocked by Shabazz Napier to seal the win for the Blazers. The good news is that Thomas has been rolling over his last three games, averaging 23 points, 6.7 assists and 2.7 3-pointers. But he doesn't have a steal in his last five games and has struggled with his shot, hitting just 11-of-37 over his last two. But as long as the Lakers keep trying to win games, Thomas should continue to put up solid numbers for the Lakers, although some steals would be nice.

The Lakers are trying to win every night out and KCP is a huge part of what they're doing. He should be owned everywhere, obviously.

             He wasn't great tonight, but a couple of the 3-pointers were big, especially the one he hit to tie the game at 103. Unfortunately for the Lakers, those were the last points they'd score in this one. The Lakers lost their first home games since Jan. 5 and lost their first game since the All-Star break, but all this winning is doing is probably going to keep them out of both the lottery and the playoffs. But the home fans have to be happy with all the wins they've got to witness over the last two months. Ball's been playing well and should bounce back on Wednesday against the Magic.

             Ingram's going to miss at least a week with a groin injury and Kuzma should continue to start, making him look like a short-term, must-add player right now. The Lakers hadn't lost at home since Jan. 5 and were 5-0 since the All-Star break. Both of those streaks came to an end tonight, but it was a great game to watch.

Dejounte Murray is the starting point guard and that isn't going to change. Leave Parker on the wire.

             He went back to the locker room followed by team trainers, but quickly returned to the bench and played in the second half. Given the circumstances, the Spurs obviously didn't go to him much in the second half which explains the low minutes. He will get checked out on Tuesday and we'll put him on the injury report to be safe. The Spurs could really use him on Thursday vs. Golden State with Pau Gasol (shoulder) considered doubtful.

             Crowder had scored in double figures in nine straight games before tonight's disaster and he had a big opportunity with Derrick Favors being a late scratch due to neck spasms. He didn't answer the call, but should bounce back in his next game. Crowder was playing well enough to be owned before this disappearing act, so hanging onto him might be the way to go for now.

Lauvergne may be asked to step up in Gasol's absence and could have some short-term value. In his only start of the season, Lauvergne had 11 points and six rebounds in 26 minutes. Just keep an eye on him in 14- and 16-team leagues and there's no guarantee that Lauvergne would get the nod in the first unit.

He's catching Ben Simmons in the ROY race and it should be fun to watch down the stretch.

            Pau Gasol injured his shoulder on Monday vs. the Grizzlies, putting his status for Thursday's game vs. the Warriors in doubt.
        
        
             ""He told me it was bad,"" Tony Parker said. ""So we will see, but I'm pretty sure he's not going to play against Golden State."" Hopefully the injury isn't as bad as Parker is suggesting, but expect the Spurs to run some tests on him Tuesday or Wednesday. The last thing the Spurs need is another injury, but look for several guys to step up if Gasol misses time such as Joffrey Lauvergne, Davis Bertans and maybe even Rudy Gay with the Spurs having to go smaller. To be clear, there are likely better options on your wire in a standard league.

             Rubio hasn't been the same guy since returning from his hip injury, but has scored in double digits in four straight and is averaging 11.2 points, 5.0 rebounds, 6.4 assists, 1.6 steals and 0.6 3-pointers on 37 percent shooting over his last five games. The Jazz are hunting the playoffs, playing amazing defense and have gone 8-2 over their last 10 games, and Rubio's shot was falling tonight. He could be getting ready to get hot, which would be a welcomed sight from his fantasy owners.

            LaMarcus Aldridge (ankle) returned from a one-game absence on Monday vs. the Grizzlies and struggled, scoring seven points on 2-of-8 shots.
        
        
             Coach Gregg Popovich said Aldridge looked rusty, but the good news is that he played 31 minutes and was moving around fine. He grabbed eight rebounds with one assist, one steal and one block, but look for him to bounce back on Thursday in a primetime matchup vs. the Warriors. The last time these two teams met, Aldridge hit 9-of-14 shots for 20 points.

             The Jazz have been one of the best defensive teams in the league since Gobert got healthy and they are rolling, currently sitting as the No. 10 seed in the West, just 1.5 games behind the Nuggets for the final playoff spot. The Jazz have won three straight and eight of their last 10, and Gobert's a big reason why. The Clippers, Nuggets, Thunder, Timberwolves, Spurs and Pelicans are all within striking distance for the Jazz (3.0 games behind the No. 4 Pelicans), but they'll have to keep winning consistently just to get in. It should be a wild race down the stretch, but we wouldn't bet against a healthy Jazz team right now.

             The Grizzlies rode Marc Gasol tonight for 37 minutes, so Davis didn't get much of a chance. The Grizzlies may rest Gasol with three games in four nights from Wednesday to Saturday, so maybe Davis can pick up a fill-in start. He's not worth deploying when Gasol is active.

             Jingles scored 16 in the first half but was held in check after the break, in part due to the strong defense of Jonathan Isaac. He's been a bit hit-or-miss lately, but is still averaging 11 points, 4.4 rebounds, 5.2 assists, 1.8 steals, 0.8 blocks and 2.4 3-pointers over his last five games, despite hitting just 39 percent of his shots. He's been worth a seventh-round fantasy pick this season and should be owned in all leagues, despite the recent shooting slump.

             Derrick Favors was a late scratch with neck spasms, so Jerebko got the start. Favors is day-to-day and the Jazz have a lot to play for, so Jerebko still belongs on waivers for now. But he played fairly well tonight, especially with the 3-point shooting.

             Brooks finished one point shy of his career-high and played 35 minutes for a Memphis team that has been devastated by injuries. Apart from the scoring, Brooks was quiet in the other categories, adding four rebounds, one assist, two triples and five turnovers. He scored in single digits in four of his previous five games, so he'll need to string a couple more good games together before he becomes more than just a deep-league asset.

             With Aaron Gordon, Jonathon Simmons and Evan Fournier all healthy, and Jonathan Isaac finally getting some solid run, it might be tough for Hezonja to do much if he's only going to get 20 minutes a night. He's averaging just 10.2 points, 2.2 rebounds, 1.8 assists, 1.6 steals and 1.4 3-pointers on 43 percent shooting over his last five games, and you might be able to do better off the wire with the Magic having so many options to use along with Mario.

             The Grizzlies were missing several players including Jarell Martin (knee), so Green put on a show against his former team. He hit 6-of-12 shots and played big minutes despite picking up five fouls, but did turn the ball over five times. He's been stuffing the stat sheet lately with 14.3 points, 12.8 rebounds, 3.3 assists, 1.5 blocks, 0.8 steals and 1.3 triples over his last four games, meaning he shouldn't be sitting on your waiver wire.

             He actually looked good out there and it's easy to see why the Magic are so excited about him. He also played some good defense on Joe Ingles after the break tonight, holding him to two points after he scored 16 in the first half. Isaac has played in three straight games after his ankle injury and is still on a minutes limit, and hasn't done enough in his three games to make us tell you to hold him. But he could come on over the last couple weeks of the season, so just keep an eye on him in case he gets hot.

             Even with the Grizzlies banged up, Selden may not be able to get much run because he's having trouble staying on the floor himself. The opportunity is there with Tyreke Evans (ribs) day-to-day and Andrew Harrison (wrist) and Mario Chalmers (hamstring) expected to miss at least a week, but Selden can be left on the wire for now.

             He hit 4-of-10 shots and even closed the game for Memphis. It was evident that XRM has some talent and the Grizzlies will need him to play a good bit of minutes during his 10-day deal with Tyreke Evans (ribs) day-to-day and Andrew Harrison (wrist) and Mario Chalmers (hamstring) expected to miss at least a week.

             Bobby Portis will start at center for the next four games, so Felicio might struggle to produce for fantasy owners in that role. He could move back into the starting lineup four games from now, but for now, he's a risky fantasy center for the next 10 days or so.

             He picked up a couple early fouls and the Spurs took advantage of his defense late in the game, but all in all it was a solid shift for the rookie. He hit 6-of-10 shots, only turned the ball over once and made a couple highlight plays, and the Grizzlies may continue to ride him in the short term -- Tyreke Evans (ribs) is day-to-day, Mario Chalmers (hamstring) will be re-evaluated in a week and Andrew Harrison (wrist) is expected to miss a week or two. He's worth a look if you need a PG in deeper leagues and is coming off a 14-point game in 20 minutes vs. the Magic on Saturday.

             He scored just seven points in 22 minutes on Friday, but helped pick up the slack for Zach LaVine (1-of-11) and Kris Dunn (3-of-10) tonight. He's averaging 12.6 points, 5.6 rebounds, 3.0 assists, 1.0 steals and 2.2 3-pointers in 28 minutes over his last five games, and is worth a fantasy look, despite coming off the Bulls' bench.

             He was 0-for-4 from downtown and hit just 2-of-4 free throws in one of his worst games of his short season. LaVine played much better in his previous two games after getting a night off to rest, but is struggling with his shot right now, hitting just 14-of-44 (32%) in his last three games. He'll look to get back on track on Wednesday against the Grizzlies, but owners have to be a little concerned the Bulls might shut him down at some point toward the end of the season. For now, just keep rolling him out there and make sure he's going to play, especially when their next back-to-back set comes around on March 23.

             Dunn had scored in double figures in previous four games and played very well in two of those, but struggled against the Celtics' tough D tonight. He'll look to bounce back against the Grizzlies on Wednesday, when he should have an easier time against one of the league's most banged up backcourts.

He's not likely to score a ton of points, but he's doing enough across the board to be used in 12-team leagues right now, as long as you can live with the 10 points a game.

Booker hit 12-of-22 shots with five assists, two rebounds and four triples, but uncharacteristically finished 3-of-6 from the line -- he was hitting 88% from the line prior to Monday. Other than that, it was business as usual for Booker as he racked up his fifth game with 30+ points out of his last six.

             He gets a 3.5 usage rate bump when Kyrie Irving (knee/rest) is out and his low minutes were mainly due to the fact the Celtics were playing the Bulls.

             Monroe, who has hit 17-of-25 shots over his last three games, is suddenly becoming relevant for the Celtics, averaging 14 points, 6.3 rebounds, and 1.3 blocks over that stretch, playing 20 minutes per night. He's impossible to trust, especially in just 20 minutes a night, but appears to have carved out a spot in Brad Stevens' rotation. And as the Celtics rest their younger (and more important) big men down the stretch in preparation for the playoffs, there's a chance Monroe could see even more minutes. Just keep an eye on him.

             He was one of just a few Suns who showed up to play along with Devin Booker and T.J. Warren. Perhaps the best part of this line is that he only picked up two fouls, and this performance comes on the heels of a 17-point effort on Sunday with four 3-pointers, five rebounds, one assist, one steal and four blocks. He's easily been one of the most frustrating players to own/stash/monitor this season, but maybe, just maybe he can keep this momentum going.

             Brown had just nine points in 24 minutes on Saturday, but bounced back with one of his best shooting performances of the season.

             He didn't play down the stretch, but that was due to the lopsided score. The Suns have allowed the fourth most fantasy points to centers this season and are currently starting a washed-up veteran in Tyson Chandler, so this was the perfect storm for Whiteside. He hit 10-of-13 shots and 4-of-5 free throws as Miami picked up their second straight win, and he should be relatively fresh for Tuesday's game vs. the Wizards on the second night of a back-to-back.

             Kyrie Irving is talking about sitting out the rest of the week and Shane Larkin is starting at point guard, but it's Rozier who is the most intriguing replacement for Irving, especially since he gets a 4.6 usage rate bump when Irving is out. Marcus Smart's also worth a look after his seven points and four assists, but Rozier seems to be the best bet for success on nights when Irving isn't playing.

            Shane Larkin started at point guard with Kyrie Irving (knee/rest) sitting out and played just 16 minutes, but still managed to finish with nine points, four rebounds, four assists, two steals and three 3-pointers.
        
        
             Irving might be shut down for his two remaining games this week, meaning Larkin could be worth a streaming look. He only took three shots tonight, they were all 3-pointers and he made all three of them, but he's going to need more minutes than this on most nights to be effective. We'd rather roll with Terry Rozier while Irving is out.

             He didn't have a minutes limit, but the Heat were probably being cautious due to the lopsided score. With that said, Miami does have more depth at their disposal and Justise Winslow has been terrific lately, so Johnson may have a tough time hitting 30 minutes consistently. He's a low-end hold while we see how the rotation sorts itself out.

             He had a nine-turnover game as a rookie and he's averaging just 2.8 turnovers on the season, which is really good considering how much he has the ball in his hands. Oladipo was due for an off night and it couldn't have worked out better for the Pacers, as he and Myles Turner both struggled, yet they still got a huge win over the Bucks in a close game.

             This is a coach's decision with Orlando losing by double digits. Isaac didn't hit a shot in the first half, but did have a couple of big blocks and has looked strong on the defensive end all season. He still has minutes restrictions, so it will be interesting to see how many minutes he finishes with.

             This game was over in a hurry, but Olynyk did some serious damage during his brief time on the floor. It's notable that Olynyk played 20 minutes compared to just five garbage-time minutes for Bam Adebayo, but this rotation is almost impossible to predict from night to night. With that said, this was Olynyk's second strong game in a row after scoring 17 points with five rebounds, four assists, one steal and three 3-pointers in 23 minutes on Saturday. With the Heat playing again on Tuesday, it's not a bad idea to pick him back up to see if he can keep it going.

             He did play all 12 minutes of garbage time to help his line and put an exclamation point on his big night with a monster dunk in the final seconds (link below). We're a bit skeptical of adding Winslow because he's a career 40.3% shooter from the field, 31.4% from 3-point range and 66.8% from the line, but he's becoming hard to ignore -- he averaged 12.3 points on 55.9% shooting with 4.5 rebounds, 2.3 assists and 1.8 steals in his previous four games. He will eventually cool off, but give him a look while he's hot.

             Surprisingly, he didn't check into the game until garbage time. ""There's a lot of guys. We're still working through the rotation,"" coach Erik Spoelstra said of Adebayo's limited run. ""The rotation will be whatever is necessary."" The addition of Luke Babbitt only makes things more complicated in Miami, and while Adebayo is capable of some big nights, he's too unreliable when the Heat are healthy up front.

             Henson has hit double figures in scoring just once in his last five games, and the same can be said for his rebounding. He's averaging just 5.8 points, 6.4 rebounds and 1.0 blocks, and if you want to drop him for a hot big man it makes sense.

             Not a monster line from the Freak, but he had a season-high six blocks last Tuesday and is now averaging 3.0 of them over his last five, his best stretch of the season. He's healthy and the Bucks are fighting for playoff position, so he should be out there getting it done from now until the end of the season.

             Fantasy owners finally have a timetable to work with. Thompson's ankle is ""incredibly swollen"" and he's in a walking boot, so this isn't a big surprise. Larry Nance is a strong pickup and had a monster game in the starting lineup on Monday with 22 points, 15 rebounds, one assist and two steals.

Harkless is safe to drop in most fantasy leagues, but consider him day-to-day. Evan Turner will draw the start and is a low-end fantasy option, while Shabazz Napier could pick up some run off the bench.

             Hill was a hot pickup after he exploded for 26 points, five assists and three 3-pointers last Tuesday, but he's still a highly inconsistent player for the Cavs. Hill has now played nine games with the Cavaliers and four of those have been good, where he's scored in double figures and done something to help fantasy owners. However, the other five of them haven't been great, featuring poor shooting, a lack of peripheral stats, and a lack of scoring. In his five single-digit scoring games he's scored a total of just 25 points, or one less than he had last Tuesday. He's worth holding, but expectations should be tempered with Hill playing alongside LeBron James.

             LeBron didn't have a flashy triple-double or set any historic NBA milestones tonight, but he still racked up some big fantasy numbers, got some rest in a blowouts and got his team another win.

             Tristan Thompson is out with a sprained ankle and Nance should put up some pretty big numbers for as long as Thompson is out. Thompson is in a walking boot and is expected to at least two weeks of time, so if Nance is available and you've been thinking about picking him up, it's officially time.

             Andre Drummond and Reggie Bullock were the only other two Pistons in double figures and neither of them had a stat line worth writing home about. Griffin's slump is over after scoring 56 points over his last two games. Prior to that, he went into a three-game funk when he scored a total of 32 points, so hopefully he's set to coast home with big lines every night.

             Traditionally, Brad Stevens has gone with either Marcus Smart or Terry Rozier when Irving has hit the sidelines, but he said he was going with Larkin tonight because he doesn't want to disrupt the second unit's rhythm. Larkin has eclipsed the 20-minute mark just three times this season but has never really produced an impressive stat line with the Celtics, so we'd still recommend rolling the dice on someone like Smart or Rozier tonight in DFS.

             Tyler Johnson (quad) remains questionable to play, but if he's forced to join Ellington on the sidelines tonight, it'll be Dwyane Wade, Justise Winslow and Rodney McGruder picking up the majority of their minutes. If your playoffs have begun, or you're battling for a post-season spot, cutting Ellington is an option.

             Collison was hit with a 2-3 week timetable on February 5, but now he's at the beginning of Week-4 and doesn't seem to be making much progress towards a return. There's nothing wrong with stashing him if you've got an open IR-spot, but it's getting tougher to justify that decision if you're battling for a playoff spot. Basically, he's just a luxury stash for high-seeded teams at this point. Corey Joseph, Joe Young and Lance Stephenson will continue to pick up the slack in his absence.

             Hood will replace Cedi Osman in the starting five, which is a lineup change head coach Tyronn Lue said he'll be going with for ""a while.""  Nance will be starting in place of Tristan Thompson (ankle) for however long he's out, which will make it easier for him to consistently see his minutes in the mid-20s. Joining Hood and Nance in the starting five will be George Hill, J.R. Smith and LeBron James.RotoGrinders.com Daily Slant: With Thompson and Green out, the Cavs have very little front-court depth which should lead to upwards of 30 minutes for Larry Nance, who is neck and neck with Terry Rozier as the top value play on the slate. Rodney Hood also picks up some appeal entering the starting lineup for Cedi Osman, as Ty Lue stated he's hoping to get Hood some extra open looks playing alongside LeBron.

             He's a negligible part of the rotation in Orlando, so his playing stats has no impact in fantasy hoops.

            Frank Vogel said that Jonathan Isaac will remain on a minutes limit this week.
        
        
             Isaac logged 15 minutes on Friday and 17.5 minutes on Saturday, and Vogel said he'd like to keep him in that range, so it doesn't sound like Isaac will be touching 20 minutes anytime soon. He's on the radar as a potential low-end defensive specialist in deep leagues, but those in most 12-team settings can do better.

             Ingram will miss at least the next three games for the Lakers, with his earliest possible return date coming Sunday vs. Cleveland. Owners in weekly settings should just go ahead and bench Ingram, and while he's out, there will be more minutes for guys like Kyle Kuzma, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope and Julius Randle.

            Ryan Anderson (hip soreness) is listed as out for Tuesday's game vs. the Thunder.
        
        
             This will be his fourth straight game on the shelf and it's not a good sign that he keeps getting ruled out a day in advance. Standard-league owners should have already moved on with fantasy playoffs starting up. Trevor Ariza, Luc Mbah a Moute, and P.J. Tucker will continue to soak up his minutes, but Ariza is the only fantasy asset in 12-team leagues.

            Tyler Johnson (left thigh contusion) is still listed as questionable for Monday's game vs. the Suns.
        
        
             The good news is that he went through the morning shootaround, so he'll likely warm up and be a game-time call tonight. The Heat could certainly use him with Wayne Ellington (thigh) expected to miss a third straight game. If Johnson can't go, Goran Dragic and Josh Richardson will be locked into heavy minutes and we could see more of several players like Justise Winslow, Rodney McGruder and Dwyane Wade.

             It sounds like Ellington will miss his third straight game, while Tyler Johnson (quad) is still considered questionable. Assuming Ellington is out, Dwyane Wade should see minutes in the mid-20s off the bench, while Justise Winslow and Rodney McGruder will have to step up on the wings, especially if Johnson can't go as well. Ellington did go through shootaround, so he should still be considered day-to-day.

The Celtics were probably being cautious with Theis and Greg Monroe had it going, but it will be interesting to see what happens tonight because Theis was playing really well before the injury.

             According to coach Brad Stevens, Irving aggravated his knee during the Houston game. He was feeling better on Sunday, but woke up on Monday morning with soreness. This is the first game Irving will miss this season due to left knee soreness (Stevens said Irving could miss Thursday's game as well), but it might be worth a mention that this is the knee that he reportedly threatened to undergo offseason surgery on if the Cavaliers didn't trade him. Check to see if Marcus Smart and Terry Rozier are available on your wire, as Smart should start, Rozier gets a 4.6 usage rate bump and Jayson Tatum also gets a 3.5 usage rate bump.

            Knicks coach Jeff Hornacek is hopeful that Michael Beasley will find the form he had before the All-Star break.
        
        
             ""We want to see Michael play as he did before the break, he was active, played with great confidence,’’ Hornacek said. ""He’s got to put some points on the board for us and defensively help out as much as he can.’’ He's been ice cold since the break, averaging 7.4 points, 4.8 rebounds, 2.0 assists and 1.0 blocks over his last five. Fantasy owners can't be too patient with playoffs starting up, so he's a drop candidate if there's a hot free agent available.

             ""Caris was great. That’s it. There was no way with the game he was having [that he was coming out],"" Atkinson said. ""There’s only so many spots out there. So, we felt like we had to go with Caris."" LeVert had a career-high 27 points with 10 of those points in the fourth quarter, so Russell's owners should shake off the quiet night and expect a bounce-back performance on Tuesday vs. the Warriors.

""Nikola is still the focal point of our offense,"" Malone said. ""I don’t want Nikola thinking that he has to play second fiddle to anyone. I want him to shoot the ball more and be more aggressive."" He was on a tear before Millsap returned with four triple-doubles in February, but his fantasy owners will be hoping that Jokic takes Malone's advice with the fantasy playoffs starting up.

Jawun Evans (abdomen) and Avery Bradley (groin) are both questionable to play again this season, while C.J. Williams and Tyrone Wallace are in the G League.

            Austin Rivers finished Sunday's win vs. the Nets with 27 points, five rebounds, four 3-pointers and three assists in 37 minutes of action.
        
        
             In his highest-scoring game since Dec. 23, Rivers went 10-of-15 from the field and 3-of-4 from the line. The win bolstered the Clippers' playoff hopes while giving Rivers' fantasy owners even more cause for optimism. At worst, he should be a cheap source of 3-pointers, steals and assists.

             Harris has never been known for his across-the-board contributions, but he's taken on new dimensions with the Clippers. Through a dozen games, he's averaging career-highs in scoring (18.4), assists (3.2) and steals (1.5), with a solid 2.1 triples, 6.6 rebounds and 0.6 blocks. L.A. moved to within 1/2 game of the Nuggets for a playoff spot tonight, so Harris' rest-of-season outlook is terrific.

             Johnson was filling in for the short-handed Clippers tonight but he missed his lone shot attempt and went scoreless without any assists or blocks. He hasn't scored more than four points in the past month, which is about all fantasy owners need to know.

             Carter also chipped in four rebounds with just one turnover. Due to the Kings' full-on youth movement, though, he's unlikely to see this much playing time on a regular basis down the stretch. Sacramento is respecting the 41-year-old veteran by letting him show what he can do, while also trying to balance using their younger players more while in tank mode. It's a tricky dance.

             RHJ also went 3-of-4 at the FT line without any turnovers in 32 minutes.

             Allen is among the qualifying league-leaders in fouls per minute, and he even fouled out of Thursday's loss vs. the Kings. He averaged 24.0 minutes in February, however, and that number should only trend up over the Nets' final 18 games. Occasional duds aside, Allen projects as a high-upside center the rest of the way.

He finished 7-of-11 from the field, including 3-of-5 from behind the 3-point line, and a perfect 5-of-5 from the free-throw line.

             Carroll shot 6-of-12 from the field with all of his makes coming beyond the arc -- that tied his career-high for made 3-pointers. At age 31, Carroll has the distinction of being the Nets' oldest player, yet he's thriving at a time when most veterans on bad teams are fading away. Over the past four games, he's averaged 19.0 points, 4.0 triples, 7.3 rebounds, 3.3 assists, 0.5 steals and 0.3 blocks, with 57.8% FGs and 80.0% FTs.

             Koufos hit 6-of-10 from the field and he also chipped in with an assist and only two turnovers in a starting role, as Willie Cauley-Stein (back) was resting his injury. It's uncertain if WCS will be ready to go by Wednesday, but at least he'll have a couple of days to mend. If not, Koufos is likely to draw another start. He might be a decent low-priced DFS option in the middle if he is plugged into the starting five again.

             Labissiere? 3-pointer? He's made just 11 triples all season, and this was the biggest since it clinched the victory with just 1.6 seconds remaining in regulation.

He has scored in double-digits in each of his three games in March, averaging 12.3 points, 7.3 rebounds, 2.3 assists and 2.3 blocks.

             Savvy owners who've had LeVert stashed since his return on Feb. 26 were richly rewarded tonight, and his 27 points were the most by a Nets' reserve since Sean Kilpatrick last March. LeVert was in attack mode early tonight and it paid off -- he challenged the Clippers' guards to prevent him from getting into the paint, and when they gave him space he drained 5-of-7 triples. He won't be on your waiver wire 24 hours from now.

             Nets coach Kenny Atkinson said before the game that he wants Russell to improve his shot selection while limiting turnovers. He had two turnovers to go along with his three dimes tonight, and half of his shot attempts were from 26 feet and beyond. It didn't help that Caris LeVert caught fire off the bench tonight, and Russell should be back in the 30-34 minute range vs. Golden State on Tuesday.

             Dinwiddie attempted one shot inside 16 feet tonight, which is an ongoing issue. ""Spencer only had five drives [Thursday],"" coach Kenny Atkinson said before the game. ""He’s top 10 in the league in drives overall."" Atkinson was suggesting that Dinwiddie lost his aggressive edge while playing alongside D'Angelo Russell, but fantasy owners can't be too upset thanks to his all-around contributions in 36 minutes of action tonight. More drives would be nice, but he also needs to make some perimeter shots -- he's a combined 3-of-23 over the past five games.

             O'Quinn hit 4-of-6 from the field while going a perfect 6-of-6 from the free-throw line, while adding eight rebounds, four assists, three blocked shots and two steals while turning it over just twice. It was quite the bounce-back game after he was scoreless on an 0-of-3 shooting night on the road against the Clippers on Friday night. The erratic production makes him a risky fantasy play in most leagues.

             Mudiay finished 0-of-6 from the field, including 0-of-3 from behind the 3-point line, and he was even 0-of-2 from the free-throw line. Mudiay had looked semi-effective in his first six games with the Knicks since coming over from the Nuggets. However, since moving into March, he is just 2-of-16 (12.5 percent) from the field while averaging just 4.5 points, 5.0 assists and 2.0 rebounds. The March version of Mudiay is the reason he fell out of favor in the Mile High City.

He wasn't so great with his ball movement, as he was credited with five miscues.

Next up is a road game vs. the Pacers on Monday.

             Parker played only six minutes in the first half, for some reason, but interim coach Joe Prunty basically couldn't go without him after halftime.

            John Henson struggled with fouls on Sunday but still scored 11 points on 5-of-9 shooting with four rebounds, two steals and one assist.
        
        
             Tyler Zeller was playing well off the bench and coach Joe Prunty continues to take a fluid approach to his three-center rotation. Henson played 22 minutes tonight, Zeller played 20 minutes, and Thon Maker was limited to just five minutes. Despite the competition, Henson is still a decent source of FG%, rebounds and blocks.

             Saric opened the game 7-of-7 from the field and the entire Sixers' offense was clicking, as they shot 55.7% as a team and 50.0% from downtown. Philly built a commanding 20-point lead early in the game but wound up falling, 118-110, after giving up a stunning 36 points off turnovers. The good news for Saric's fantasy owners is that his role hasn't been impinged by new arrival Ersan Ilyasova.

             During one incredible sequence early in the third quarter, the Sixers repeatedly drew fouls by posting up Embiid -- they got four fouls on a single possession, and were in the bonus less than a minute into the quarter. He had a slight limp after banging his knee on a screen early in the game, but he didn't miss time and appeared to be fine. Still, it can't hurt to double-check his status prior to Tuesday's game in Charlotte.

            Ersan Ilyasova struggled with fouls vs. his former team on Sunday, scoring seven points on 2-of-6 shooting with three rebounds and one assist in 18 minutes.
        
        
             Ilyasova has played for six different teams in the NBA, but his first seven seasons were all with the Bucks. His minutes were limited as he picked up five fouls tonight, but even in a best-case scenario he's unlikely to play more than 20-24 per night as Dario Saric's backup.

             Redick has been a natural fit in Philly, and he hopes to re-sign as an unrestricted free agent this summer. ""This is something that I’ll reiterate ... I want this to be a long-term thing [with the Sixers],"" he said. ""I love playing here. I love playing with these guys. I love playing for [coach Brett Brown]."" Redick projects as a stable top-100 dynasty option if he does re-sign with the Sixers, and his rest-of-season value is safe thanks to a competitive playoff race.

             Simmons didn't attempt any free throws tonight, which is the first time that's happened in nearly six weeks. Considering he shoots nearly as well from the field (53.4%) as the FT line (57.4%), his lack of attempts was a blessing in category-based leagues. Simmons is still just 21 years old and it's scary to think what he's capable of long-term.

             Scott hit 4-of-8 from the field and he added three assists and a steal with just two turnovers while adding a pair of 3-pointers. He was seeing about 10 more minutes of playing time with Kelly Oubre (foot) on the shelf resting his ailing left foot. Scott has some short-term fantasy appeal in deeper leagues, and he might be a decent low-cost punt option in DFS on Tuesday against Miami if KO remains out.

However, he picked up four personal fouls in his 22 minutes and was nailed to the bench for huge chunks of time. Chalk it up as one bad game, as he remains a must-start fantasy option as long as John Wall (knee) remains sidelined. He'll look to bounce back Tuesday against Miami to kick off a three-game scoring period.

Ian Mahinmi was quite a bit more effective at both ends of the floor, so he chipped into Gortat's playing time. It's uncertain if Mahinmi will continue to carve into Gortat's minutes, but head coach Scott Brooks hasn't been shy to get away from his starters when they're struggling or not pulling their weight.

             The Wizards were searching for a playmaker with Bradley Beal struggling with his shot, and Mahinmi was an unlikely hero off the bench. He shot 3-of-5 from the field with an assist, a blocked shot and a plus-11 rating to keep his team in the game while flirting with a double-double in his brief playing time. Despite the solid effort he remains useful only in the deepest of fantasy leagues heading into the new week.

Despite his struggles, the Wizards put the ball in his hands late, and he had a drive and finish for a three-point play. He also added a step-back jumper to chop the lead down to four late, but the Wizards couldn't get over the hump. Beal also had a late turnover which proved costly down the stretch.

            Dirk Nowitzki went 8-of-13 from the field and 4-of-4 from the line for a season-high 23 points in 26 minutes on Sunday.
        
        
             In the process, Dirk moved ahead of Elvin Hayes for 8th all-time in made field goals (10,980), with Wilt Chamberlain next on the list. He added seven rebounds, one assist and one block tonight, while hitting three 3-pointers, and it's still amazing that he's only had one DNP this season. As a veteran on a lousy team, Dirk is playing on borrowed time. Let's see what happens during the Mavs' next back-to-back set on Mar. 10-11.

             The Mavs were playing without Wesley Matthews (left hip), which bumped Ferrell into yet another new-look starting unit. Dallas isn't going anywhere and they're likely to play it safe with the veteran swingman, so Ferrell could plausibly earn another start vs. Denver on Tuesday. As this line shows, though, that's no guarantee he'll help fantasy owners.

             The undrafted rookie stepped up with Wesley Matthews (hip) unavailable tonight. Yogi Ferrell moved into the starting unit and Collinsworth joined J.J. Barea as the primary backup guards, but he's still not worth touching outside of the deepest leagues.

             Noel came in averaging just 15.5 minutes in his previous two games. Conditioning might be part of the problem, but he played more than 20 minutes just once while healthy earlier in the season and the Mavs simply seem reluctant to turn him loose. That could change if Harrison Barnes (31 minutes) or Dirk Nowitzki (26 minutes) are rested at some point, but for now Noel remains little more than a luxury stash.

             DSJ had four turnovers without any 3-pointers, but he also went 5-of-6 at the FT line -- that's critical in roto leagues, since he's just 68.7% on the season. The No. 9 pick has scored 20 points in 12 games this season, tying Sean Rooks for the fifth-highest total by any Mavs rookie, and he's picking up momentum as the Mavs enter the final stretch of the season. With averages of 24.0 points, 5.5 assists, 3.0 rebounds and 1.0 steals in March, his owners' patience appears to be paying off.

             Miller fills his role admirably as a 3-and-D bench option, but it's not a role conducive to reliable fantasy value. Nevertheless, he's been an integral part of the Pelicans' recent success -- they've scored 118+ points in a franchise-best eight straight games, all of which have been victories.

             Holiday's career-high 49.5% shooting ranks eighth in the NBA among guards -- among players averaging at least 30 minutes, he trails only Klay Thompson, Darren Collison, Ben Simmons and teammate E'Twaun Moore (seven points, two assists in 30 minutes). Jrue has made at least half of his FG attempts in six consecutive games, and he's tied a career-best streak with 20+ points in eight straight. He's carrying plenty of owners into the fantasy playoffs.

             Diallo fell one rebound shy of his career-high, and his efforts helped the bench maintain and extend leads while Anthony Davis and Jrue Holiday rested. That was even more important since Nikola Mirotic was starting tonight for Emeka Okafor (ankle), leaving the bench particularly thin. He might fall back into the 10-15 minute range once Okafor returns, but this eye-opening performance will at least give coach Alvin Gentry some food for thought.

             Emeka Okafor (right ankle) was out tonight, although Mirotic may have started anyway against a team that starts Dirk Nowitzki at center. He was firing on all cylinders offensively and it's a welcome sight for fantasy owners -- Niko's rebounds (8.1), steals (1.3) and blocks (1.4) are all up with New Orleans, but he'd been averaging 14.0 points on 39.6% shooting. He's poised for a big finish no matter where he begins games.

             Sabonis was nailed to the bench with Myles Turner doing a good job, particularly at the defensive end. When Sabonis got into the game, he was just 2-of-6 from the field and he turned it over four times in his brief time on the court to zero miscues for Turner. He remains a hold for most fantasy owners, but he obviously has a lot less fantasy appeal as long as Turner remains healthy.

             Turner wasn't terribly efficient from the field, going just 4-of-12, including 1-of-5 from behind the 3-point line. But he stuck with it and was a solid 3-of-3 at the free-throw line while also adding three assists and a steal with no turnovers and a plus-20 rating. His offensive production has yo-yoed a bit lately, but he continues to post nice rebound and blocked shot totals for his fantasy owners. He'll be back at it again Monday to start a four-game scoring period.

We'll pass along test results once they're available, and it sounds like Oubre is questionable at best to play vs. the Heat on Tuesday. The Wizards play three times next week, so owners should weigh their options carefully. Jodie Meeks stands to gain the most if he misses more games, with Otto Porter also playing as many minutes as he can handle.

             Ibaka played 30 minutes tonight and this was a welcome sight after two single-digit scoring performances. Part of the problem is that Toronto's bench is thriving and they're blowing out teams on a routine basis, but Ibaka is still holding mid-round roto value for the past month. With four games on the schedule this week, he's an obvious lock in active lineups.

             Powell didn't fare well as a fill-in starter for OG Anunoby (knee) on Friday, and coach Dwane Casey replaced him with Malcolm Miller tonight. There was considerable buzz around Powell this preseason as a potential starter or sixth-man, but he's been a disappointment in fantasy leagues with just 5.8 points, 1.7 rebounds and 1.4 assists in 15.9 minutes per game.

             JV didn't get to the FT line tonight, but he went 2-of-3 from deep and generally outworked Dwight Howard in an eventual 103-98 home win. Toronto swept their season matchup vs. Charlotte for the first time in 11 years, and they're rolling again with four straight wins. Even though his minutes are typically in the 20-24 range, JV is a safe every-night play in typical leagues.

             Batum has now dished out 7+ assists in a career-high eight consecutive games, the longest such streak for the Hornets since Raymond Felton in 2009. After some early struggles and concerns about his elbow, which may require offseason surgery, he's come alive over the past month with 11.8 points, 2.0 triples, 4.9 rebounds, 6.9 assists, 1.6 steals, 0.3 blocks and just 1.4 turnovers. That's good for mid-round value in almost any format.

He also had four rebounds and two steals with just two turnovers across 38 minutes. Bogdanovic is averaging 19.8 PPG with 4.8 RPG over the past four outings while hitting 2.5 3-pointers per contest.

             Carter-Williams dealt had surgery to repair a torn labrum in his right shoulder in 2014, so at least this issue involves his left shoulder -- which he also strained in late January. His return tonight is a great sign, but it wouldn't be surprising if he's on the injury report prior to Monday's game vs. the Pacers. Anyone relying on him in deep leagues should check back after Charlotte's shootaround.

             Zeller missed the previous two games, both losses, and his return wasn't enough to beat the East's top seed on the road in Toronto.

             C.J. Williams and Tyrone Wallace are both in the G League, and the Clippers just signed Sean Kilpatrick earlier on Sunday, so they'll turn to Johnson to fill out the starting lineup. He's a decent source of 3-pointers and defensive stats when he gets enough minutes, but it's a recommended pickup.

             We'll pass along updates but if he can't return in the second half, coach Steve Clifford could use Jeremy Lamb as a ball-handler more often with the second unit.

             Foul trouble was an issue for Collins in this one, and he also got stuffed a few times at the rim, which probably hurt his confidence a bit. It wasn't a great game for the rookie, but there's not an obvious threat to his minutes in Atlanta, and we'd expect a bit of a bounce-back performance on Tuesday in Toronto.

             Things got very chippy towards the end of Sunday's win over the Suns, as Josh Jackson and Taurean Prince got into a brief shoving match under the hoop, which Elfrid Payton and Taylor joined in on. Both Payton and Taylor were ejected, while Prince and Jackson received technicals, but there shouldn't be any further disciplinary action from Sunday's relatively minor altercation. Malcolm Delaney left the game with an ankle injury, so Taylor could see more minutes moving forward.

             Dorsey did an excellent job on defense against Devin Booker throughout the game, never backing down, and forcing Booker to take a tough fallaway jumper on Phoenix's final possession which clanked off the rim. As good as he was, he'll likely head back to a limited bench role on Monday with Kent Bazemore (rest) set to return to the starting five, so he's not a great add in most settings.

             Prince finally came through with an efficient outing, going 8-of-16 from the field and 6-of-8 from beyond the arc, which is the first time he had hit at least 50% of his shots since February 8. He was cold blooded to close the game, scoring 13 of his 22 points through the fourth quarter of action, including an off-balance, game-winning triple (link below) to seal the deal for Atlanta. As good as he was, we're not totally willing to say he's busted out of his shooting funk, considering this efficient stat line came against one of the worst defenses in the league.

             Thompson stepped on someone's heel during Saturday's game and although he continued to play, he experienced ""significant swelling"" overnight. He's a poor fantasy option even at full strength, so this should impact many 12-team lineups, but it leaves the Cavs with a glaring hole in the middle. Without Kevin Love (hand), they could start Larry Nance Jr. at center, and may even dust off Ante Zizic for some frontcourt minutes.

             Schroder had the hot hand early for Atlanta and was very aggressive in seeking out his own shot, but he was strangely sent to the bench when the fourth quarter came around and never got back into the game despite Isaiah Taylor getting ejected and Malcolm Delaney leaving with an ankle injury. Schroder didn't appear to suffer an injury during the game, so maybe he did something that put him in Mike Budenholzer's doghouse, which wouldn't be all that surprising.

Hopefully he'll feel fine during shootaround and convince the Spurs' staff to let him play, but we should know more late Monday afternoon.

             Chriss racked up two swats immediately upon entering the game, and he also provided some nice floor spacing for Phoenix, knocking down a career-high in triples while the Suns struggled from beyond the arc as a team. This is Chriss' upside, but as we've seen before he tends to follow up solid performances with a string of duds, so we'd like to see him do this again before recommending him as an add in most 12-team leagues. Additionally, he appeared to tweak his right wrist while blocking John Collins (link below), so that's something we'll be looking out for on Monday in Miami.

             Mario Chalmers (right hamstring) and Tyreke Evans (ribs) are also unavailable, which means Kobe Simmons could be pressed into the starting PG role vs. San Antonio. Ben McLemore should also handle the ball more often, and the Grizzlies' rotations are simply a mess due to injuries and tanking.

Gasol sat out Saturday's game as a precaution in the second half of a back-to-back set, and details about his injuries are non-existent. Owners should check for updates after the Grizzlies' shootaround. Deyonta Davis would be busy if Gasol can't go, assuming Davis can play through his own ankle injury.

             Warren had a semi-slow start to this one going 2-of-5 from the field through the first quarter of action, but he caught fire during the second quarter, netting 17 of his 35 points on 8-of-9 shooting and never really slowed down after that. This was also Warren's fifth 30-point performance of the season, which is something he had done just once through his first three years in the league.

             He added three triples, one rebound, three assists, one steal and an unfortunate five turnovers while he was out there, and he was fairly pretty sloppy with the rock through the first half of action, ending the first quarter with back-to-back turnovers. This wasn't the best game from Booker, but he came into this one riding a four-game streak with at least 30 points, so we'll give him a pass and expect a bit of a bounce-back performance on Monday in Miami.

             The defensive stats were an anomaly for Chandler, who is averaging just 0.3 steals and 0.6 blocks per game on the season, but his return to active roster nearly pushed Alex Len out of the rotation entirely. He did have a fairly hilarious moment in which he hit a mediocre layup and flexed on Dennis Schroder (link below), but the reality is, Chandler isn't worth owning in most leagues.

            Alex Len saw just two minutes off the bench in Sunday's one-point loss to the Hawks, scoring two points at the line without recording any other statistics.
        
        
             Len checked in for a short two-minute stint at the beginning of the second quarter, but with Marquese Chriss playing well and Atlanta using a lot of small-ball lineups, he just never got back into the game. Len tends to play well when Tyson Chandler isn't available, but his minutes are far less consistent with Chandler in the rotation, and it will only get worse if Alan Williams (knee) is able to make it back to the court this season.

             Payton got involved in a shoving match with a few Atlanta players towards the end of regulation (link below) and was booted, but his actions likely weren't enough to warrant a suspension. Before being ejected, Payton showed some great hustle on the defensive end and did an excellent job of running the floor and picking his spots in the offense. He’s in a great spot to produce in Phoenix, and shouldn’t have any trouble finishing the year as a top-70 player in 9-cat leagues.

            Malcolm Miller will be in the starting lineup for Sunday's game against the Hornets, sending Norman Powell back to the bench.
        
        
             Miller will earn his first career start in his seventh NBA outing, and he'll be joined by Kyle Lowry, DeMar DeRozan, Serge Ibaka and Jonas Valanciunas. Dwane Casey said that the starting small forward position will be ""fluid"" while OG Anunoby (ankle) is out, so while Miller will start tonight, he could head right back to the bench for his next game. This is a wait-and-see situation.

             Delaney rolled his left ankle on a drive to the hoop, and while he initially stayed in to attempt his free throws he went straight back to the locker room afterwards and was quickly ruled out for the remainder of the game. He'll end his evening with 12 points, three triples, three assists, one rebound, two steals, one block and zero turnovers in 15 minutes off the bench. If he can't play Tuesday in Toronto, expect more minutes for Isaiah Taylor.

             It sounds like Zeller will be back out there following a two-game stint on the sidelines, which will result in fewer minutes for guys like Frank Kaminsky and Willy Hernangomez. That said, as long as Dwight Howard is healthy, Zeller won't earn enough minutes in Charlotte to make a meaningful impact in most leagues.

             The Hornets want Zeller to go through his pregame routine before an official decision is made, which is encouraging, but it's also worth noting he was a game-time call on Friday and wasn't able to get out there. Check back closer to tip-off for official confirmation on his status.

Joining Chandler in the starting five will be Elfrid Payton, Devin Booker, T.J. Warren and Dragan Bender.

            Bulls coach Fred Hoiberg said the plan is to keep David Nwaba in the first unit.
        
        
             The Bulls are making lineup changes every five games, but as expected, Hoiberg has no interest in moving Nwaba out of the first unit for now. He averaged 12.4 points, 8.4 rebounds, 2.2 assists, 1.8 steals and 1.0 triples in 32.6 minutes over his last five starts, and Hoiberg has called him an ""underrated playmaker"" and loves his ""rebounding and ability to push the pace.""

             His return is based on his comfort level with managing the injury, and he's expected to see the court at some point in March. ""He's doing what he's supposed to do. He's working hard at it,"" coach Gregg Popovich said last week. ""He wants to be back. When and if he feels like he's ready to go, he'll be there."" If/when he is cleared, it's fair to expect heavy restrictions.

             Beasley hasn't been happy with the Knicks ball movement and blasted his teammates after Friday's loss to the Clippers. Knicks coach Jeff Hornacek didn't like those comments and also singled out Beasley for his lack of defense in the loss. Beasley has been cold since the break, but we'll see what happens on Sunday. His tweaked ankle may be a reason for his poor play.

             The Grizzlies have a ton of injuries to their backcourt right now with Tyreke Evans (ribs), Andrew Harrison (wrist), Mario Chalmers (hamstring) and Wayne Selden (knee) banged up. That means both Xavier Rathan-Mayes and Kobi Simmons could get some burn going forward. In 39 G-League games, Rathan-Mayes has made a strong impression with 16.6 points, 7.2 assists, 6.4 rebounds, 1.9 steals and 1.6 triples.

""That to me is a dynamic, game-changing lineup that I want them to continue to gain confidence in, get more comfortable with."" After two strong games with a combined 52 points, Wade cooled off on Saturday with 11 points, six rebounds and one assist in 23 minutes. We expect him to stick around that workload going forward, limiting his upside in fantasy leagues.

""Not only is he a solid player and a solid team player, his character fits with our team and what we are trying to accomplish."" The Pacers are already strong up front with Myles Turner, Thaddeus Young and Domantas Sabonis, so Booker is only looking at a handful of minutes off the bench. He's not expected to make his debut until Monday.

He remains useful only in the deepest of fantasy formats.

             Collins ended up holding down the fort at power forward with Ed Davis in the middle, and the duo did a great job down the stretch subbing for an ineffective Al-Farouq Aminu and Jusuf Nurkic. Despite the solid 5-of-6 shooting night, including 2-of-2 from behind the arc, Collins isn't going to force Nurkic to the bench anytime soon. He remains useful only in the deepest of fantasy formats at this time.

             McCollum entered the game with shooting woes over the past three outings, hitting just 20-of-66 (33.3 percent), so this was a nice game. The Blazers are on a six-game winning streak, so the shooting woes have likely only been noticed by his fantasy owners. He'll look to keep things going in a positive direction on the road Monday against the Lakers to kick off a three-game week.

Nurkic entered averaging 15.8 PPG with 9.6 RPG over his past five outings, so chalk this up as just one bad game. He is going to be replaced in the lineup anytime soon.

For those people who rolled the dice on him in DFS, he did a decent enough job.

             Aminu's shot wasn't falling, as he hit just 1-of-7 from the field. He was able to salvage the line somewhat with six rebounds and a steal while committing just one turnover, but he was an ugly minus-13 despite the fact his team won at home by eight points. Luckily for the Blazers they had Zach Collins, Ed Davis and Pat Connaughton all coming off the bench and hitting shots.

The bad news is the poor shooting performance, but the good news is that he added seven assists, a rebound, a steal and a blocked shot and his team picked up a sixth consecutive victory to move 11 games over .500.

He added four rebounds, two assists and two blocked shots to give his fantasy owners in deeper formats a pretty decent line. He was seeing a bit of a bump with Carmelo Anthony resting, but look for his production to decrease with 'Melo likely back on Tuesday against Houston.

            Skal Labissiere came off the bench with 12 points, 12 rebounds, three assists, three blocks and one 3-pointer in 29 minutes during a 98-91 loss to the Jazz on Saturday.
        
        
             He still played down the stretch in this loss and his minutes are back up. Labissiere's shot selection is a lot better and continues to be aggressive on the defensive end to help out his blocks total. Consistency has been a thorn in his side in his young career, but that's three good games in his last four with 26-plus minutes in each. He's trending up as a pickup in standard leagues, but beware of some duds.

             Anderson also tacked on five assists, four rebounds and two steals with just one turnover across 22 minutes. Rudy Gay saw more minutes off the bench, but he wasn't nearly as effective. Even though Anderson outplayed Gay statistically, there is no way he'll see more minutes than the veteran. He'll look to keep it going on Monday against the visiting Grizzlies, the first contest in a three-game week.

             His minutes continue to climb and it's nice to see that two-PG lineups are on the table. Mason isn't going to shoot the ball well, but he has upside for threes, dimes and steals. He's more of a streaming option in most leagues, but he could have a nice chance to produce against the Knicks on Sunday.

             The Kings went with a double-big lineup up front because of the matchup against Derrick Favors and Rudy Gobert. Willie Cauley-Stein (back) is probably going to miss Sunday's game, so Koufos could find himself getting minutes again vs. the Knicks. He's only worth a stream and that would change if WCS is a go.

             The Kings didn't have Willie Cauley-Stein, so that forced coach Dave Joerger's hand to play both Z-Bo and Kosta Koufos. WCS could be out again on Sunday, so maybe Z-Bo can produce against one of his former teams, the Knicks. Once Cauley-Stein is back, expect Randolph to get off at least once per week.

About the only thing that went wrong was Pau was 0-of-3 from behind the 3-point line and he added 3-of-6 from the free-throw line. He flirted with a triple-double against his former team, and he played without any limits or restrictions.

He had a huge opportunity in the starting five, but he was also facing a decent defensive club.

Although, Chris Paul getting into some foul trouble today may have slightly helped Gordon. He'll be elite in 3-pointers the rest of the way.

            Trevor Ariza scored 21 points with three rebounds, two assists, three assists and four 3-pointers 34 minutes against the Celtics on Saturday.
        
        
             Even with the big scoring game, Ariza was terrific on the defensive end and made timely plays. Ariza had a bright green light with 13 attempts from deep and now he's made at least three treys in each of his five games, averaging 13.2 points, 4.0 boards, 1.0 assists, 1.4 steals and 3.2 treys. He's locked in as a must-start player in standard leagues.

             He had an adventure at the line to end this game as the Celtics blew a lead after three quarters. Irving tried to miss his second attempt with five seconds left, but the ball went in off the bank. With 2.8 seconds left, Irving missed on purpose again, but he didn't hit the rim to turn the ball over. The Celtics lost some ground on the Raptors and are 1.5 games behind now, so this should be a tight race for the 1.5 months. That should mean Irving is all set for no rest until April.

            Marcus Morris matched his season-high 21 points against the Rockets on Saturday, adding four rebounds, one assist, three steals and five 3-pointers.
        
        
             The 3-pointers were the story to help keep the Celtics in it, which comes as a surprise after Morris made just 2-of-11 from deep in his previous three. The steals were also uncharacteristic for Morris with his 0.5 per game on the season before today. This big game doesn't really move the needle on him as a pickup.

             He almost tied this game with a miss at the buzzer on a fadeaway three. Additionally, he suffered what looked like a knee injury in the fourth quarter and he limped off the floor, but he was able to return. Smart has been pretty solid offensively over his last five, making 47.5 percent from the field with averages of 10.0 points, 2.8 boards, 5.4 assists, 1.4 steals and 1.0 treys. He's probably worth owning in most leagues, but expect him to be near 40 FG% going forward.

             Nance hit 6-of-10 from the field, while going 2-of-2 from the free-throw line, and he added eight rebounds. He is quickly endearing himself to the fans in Cleveland, and it doesn't hurt that his dad used to be a fan favorite back in the late 1980's and early 1990's. Nance has the chance to be a decent fantasy option, and he should continue to see a decent role while Kevin Love (hand) is on the shelf.

It wasn't a 'soup'er outing, but it wasn't bad, either. Hopefully he won't chuck any more chicken tortilla soup cans at assistant coach Damon Jones - or anyone else - and he'll stay in the lineup for his fantasy owners.

The Cavaliers are desperate for a secondary scoring option to LeBron James, and Hill could be that guy. However, he is still getting comfortable with his teammates and it will take some time. He remains a solid fantasy option, but he isn't considered a must-own at this point.

             Osman snapped a three-game streak with single-digit scoring totals. In fact, he had made a total of six field goals over the past three outings until this solid performance. LeBron James is desperate for a secondary scoring option with Kevin Love (hand) on the still on the mend. Even with Osman doing a pretty decent job, he remains useful only in deeper fantasy leagues, especially since there are so many other options like Jordan Clarkson, Jeff Green, Rodney Hood, Larry Nance Jr. etc.

             Things looked bleak to start the game with two quick fouls, but Whiteside had just two the rest of the way. Offensively, he did have a tough time against Andre Drummond, making just 2-of-10 from the field. Drummond and Whiteside were both dominant on the offensive glass with 19 offensive boards between them -- Whiteside had eight. Bam Adebayo not playing gave Whiteside a longer leash, so hopefully he can continue to flirt with 30 minutes more often.

            Gary Harris ended up with a game-high 32 points across 37 minutes on Saturday night in Cleveland.
        
        
             Harris hit 10-of-17 from the field, including an impressive 6-of-10 from behind the 3-point line, while going a perfect 6-of-6 from the free-throw stripe. He also added four assists, two rebounds and a steal while committing zero turnovers. After a stinker against Houston last Sunday, Harris has been on fire. He is averaging 27.0 PPG and 2.7 SPG across the past three outings while knocking down 3.7 3-pointers per outing. He'll look to keep it rolling in Denver's upcoming four-game week.

            James Johnson scored 14 points in a start against the Pistons on Saturday, adding two rebounds, one assist, three steals, one block and two 3-pointers in 27 minutes.
        
        
             That'll work. Johnson had a tough assignment against Blake Griffin and he was cooked early, but he picked it up with the steals turning into some easy buckets for him. Bam Adebayo (personal) not playing today certainly helped Johnson's playing time, but his owners will take it for the most part. The bad part? That would be his 0-of-4 from the line. Johnson is still a borderline hold and could be viewed as a defensive-stat specialist.

             The Blue Arrow shot 6-of-11 from the field, including a very effective 3-of-4 from behind the 3-point line. He was one of just two starters with a plus-11 rating or better. He bounced back rather nicely after a single-digit scoring effort in Memphis on Friday night. The Nuggets are on tap for four games in the upcoming week, so fantasy owners are likely in for a big week.

             He basically had one job and that was to launch treys with eight of his nine shots coming from deep. With Bam Adebayo likely back for Monday, Babbitt is likely going to move out of the rotation.

             After making a start at power forward on Thursday, Olynyk moved to the backup center spot because of no Bam Adebayo (personal). Hassan Whiteside picked up two early fouls to help get Olynyk going early and he kept it going in the second half.  Adebayo should be back on Monday, but Olynyk could be worth a look to start next week with a back-to-back on Monday and Tuesday.

             He had a very un-Drummond line on Friday with just 10 points, 15 boards and no defensive stats, which is even more surprising against a team like the Magic. The Pistons are not playing good ball right now with just a 1-5 record since the break, but the schedule hasn't been nice to them with games against the Heat, Raptors, Bucks and Celtics. Their schedule gets even tougher over the next two weeks, including games at Cleveland, at Utah, at Denver, at Portland and a game at home against the Raptors. Things aren't looking good for them to make the playoffs, but Drummond's fantasy owners shouldn't worry too much about that.

             That's better. Griffin had a hot start early with 20 points before half and he finally had his shot working today, making 10-of-21 from the field and all eight free throws. The offense continues to run through him, so he'll be adding plenty of boards and dimes the rest of the way. Hopefully, he's going to continue to hit jumpers down the stretch or else the Pistons may be out of the playoff race.

             Jokic made up for the shortcomings in scoring by posting eight assists, seven rebounds and a blocked shot while also adding a 3-pointer. He has struggled with his shot a bit in two games in March, hitting just 5-of-13 (38.5 percent), but he'll be just fine. He is just a few games removed from a three-game triple-double streak.

             He's been horrible for three games now and it's becoming really hard to hold him on your roster with Reggie Jackson being on the comeback trail. Clearly, Blake Griffin running the offense more has capped Smith's upside right now and he's losing minutes to Dwight Buycks, too. Smith's fantasy owners may want to see what else is out there.

             Millsap is back running with the first unit and it appears he is 100 percent after missing just a little over three months due to a wrist injury. While head coach Mike Malone recently said Millsap's conditioning is an issue, it appears he'll get a chance to play his way back into shape. He has played 26 or more minutes in each of the past two outings after being limited in his first game back. He was also able to play in a back-to-back situation, so fantasy owners will be glad to see there was no issue with that. The Nuggs are on track for four games in the upcoming week, so start him as you normally would.

Ennis should find himself getting minutes in the upper 20s, but he doesn't do enough in the non-scoring aspects of the stat sheet.

The Magic aren't tanking and are on a two-game winning streak, so hopefully the front office doesn't get any ideas to rest their starters.

He's still been a fine hold, but there's a very good chance he'll have some duds.

            Jonathan Isaac played 18 minutes against the Grizzlies on Saturday, failing to score with five rebounds and three blocks.
        
        
             He was big time on the defensive end and coach Frank Vogel upped his minutes over his 15-minute limit. Excluding his first half on Friday, Isaac has looked the part of an impact defensive player and it shows with his two steals and four blocks in the last two. He's worth a look in deeper leagues as a defensive specialist.

            Jarell Martin scored 19 points with 11 rebounds, two assists and one 3-pointer in 35 minutes during a 107-100 loss to the Magic on Saturday.
        
        
             The Grizzlies continue to lose players in their rotation, but Martin has been locked and loaded. It's hard to believe he was almost cut before the preseason because now he's been a three-position staple. He's played 33.2 minutes per game over his last five, averaging 12.8 points, 6.0 boards, 3.0 assists, 0.6 blocks and 1.0 treys. He's worth an add in standard leagues until we see the Grizzlies start to get players back.

             The usage and minutes were certainly there as the starting center with Marc Gasol resting today. Green doesn't seem to be limited like the other veterans, so he should have a chance to play minutes in the 30s most nights. Considering how banged-up this team is, Green is worth an add in standard leagues. He needs to shoot the ball better, of course.

             Well, he's the fifth point guard usually, but now he's the only healthy one left with Mario Chalmers (hamstring) getting hurt tonight and Wayne Selden (knee) being held out. If Tyreke Evans (rib) and Andrew Harrison (wrist) can't play on Monday, Simmons could be getting huge minutes because the Grizzlies still have limits on Selden. He's worth a look in deep leagues.

             He lost the ball a bunch on his drives and the rust was highly apparent. Hopefully, Parsons can have a good offseason to get his career turned around. Leave him on the wire in fantasy because he's up to 25 total minutes in 2018.

             The move of JaMychal Green to the first unit hurt Rabb's upside and maybe the Grizzlies aren't totally comfortable playing him more than 25 minutes. Rabb should still stick in the rotation with Marc Gasol back on Monday, assuming Deyonta Davis is still out.

             That's one point off his season-high 21, and it crushes his 4.0 points per game from February. The Grizzlies are running out of guards right now, so McLemore may find himself getting 30 minutes for the next week or so. He's been awful leading up to March, so you would have to be dropping something you won't miss to add him. Plus, maybe the other guards won't be out much longer.

            Mario Chalmers (right hamstring) will not return against the Magic on Saturday.
        
        
             Oh boy. That means the Grizzlies are missing four point guard options now with Wayne Selden (knee), Tyreke Evans (rib) and Andrew Harrison already out today. Hamstring injuries do not heal quickly, so Chalmers is likely looking at time off. If he's out while Evans and Harrison can't play Monday, we may see a lot of Selden and especially Kobi Simmons. Chalmers had a nice game before the injury with 15 points, one rebound, three assists, two steals and three 3-pointers.

             He was really the only option unless coach Terry Stotts got crazy. Turner has not been playing well lately, so he's a very risky DFS play. Shabazz Napier is coming off two big games and Stotts loves his three-PG lineup, so we may see more of that tonight. Napier is worth a look in 12-team leagues.

With him out, that should mean both Kosta Koufos and Zach Randolph are out there tonight, but don't be shocked if that's not the case. Skal Labissiere also has a good chance to produce today.

            Kyle Kuzma will start for Brandon Ingram (hip) against the Spurs on Saturday.
        
        
             The Lakers are basically out of small forwards, so they'll slide Kuzma up to the three for this game. Kuzma has played small forward before and has this week, so it shouldn't be a tough adjustment. He'll have a huge opportunity today with a lot of shots available.

             That should put him back in the first unit and he could be looking at more opportunity to score with Marc Gasol resting. Jarell Martin should still get his minutes and Ivan Rabb should be able to soak up most of the center action. Green could be worth owning in standard leagues and is a DFS option, but obviously there's risk after he missed Friday.

It sounds like Green may have to battle through this injury for most of the season, but the Cavs have enough depth without him.

Anthony's minutes are slightly up since the breakout 33.0 per game, but he's made  just 35.8 percent from the field in that span. It'll be Jerami Grant getting some extra minutes along with Alex Abrines, Corey Brewer and Terrance Ferguson.

             Matthews only played 31 minutes on Friday night and scored just five points, so he may have been playing through that last night. He did finish the game and played the final seven minutes, so it's likely not a bad injury. Of course, the Mavs are ticketed to the lottery, so it's possible Matthews is out.

In all sincerity, Beasley has been incredibly self-reflective about his journey to, from, and back to the NBA, but reputations are very easy to get and incredibly hard to change. ""'Cause my thing is I don't want to just score, I want to make players better,"" Beasley said. ""And I didn't even know that about myself until I went to China the first time."" At the same time, Beasley complained after Friday night's loss about his lack of touches as well as New York's selfish style of play, so perhaps old habits die hard. We shall see.

He tore his hamstring before the season started and we've heard very little in terms of meaningful updates, but it sounds like we're finally reaching a point where he could be close to a return. The Pelicans could certainly use Hill—even in a limited capacity—and it sounds like the first opportunity for a potential return would be on Friday, March 9. For now, just keep an eye on the situation as it unfolds over the next week.

             Patton is still working his way back into shape after missing so much of his rookie season with a foot injury. He's highly unlikely to play any kind of meaningful minutes in his inaugural campaign.

Even if Selden does play, we don't expect more 10-15 minutes at best. With Tyreke Evans (rib) and Andrew Harrison (wrist) having already been ruled out, Mario Chalmers and Ben McLemore should be incredibly busy.

             Per Stefan Bondy of the New York Daily News: ""As scouts have noted for months, Ntilikina isn’t quick enough with his dribble to play point guard in the NBA — at least not at this stage of his development. It hinders his playmaking abilities. On defense, Ntilikina’s length allows him to defend shooting guards."" As a result of the transition, Ntilikina is watching tape of DeMar DeRozan, saying that he's ""learning every day"" and has a desire to bring ""everything to the team."" No matter how it's spun, it's clear that the idea the Knicks drafted Ntilikina to be their point guard of the future is no longer team-driven. Expect the rookie to continue playing alongside Emmanuel Mudiay and/or Trey Burke.

             Love was previously quoted as hopeful to return sooner, but players are always optimistic about injury timelines regardless of realistic expectations. If Love does indeed wind up missing a full eight weeks, he wouldn't be back until the last week in March, leaving the big man a very limited window of time to be a fantasy asset down the stretch.

             Collison is expected to return at some point in early March, and his next opportunity will be on Monday vs. Milwaukee.

As a starter, Joseph has averaged 7.0 points, 4.3 rebounds, 4.0 assists, and 1.0 steals (1.6 TO) on just 34.7% shooting.

             We're not sure how many times Stevens has to address this, but perhaps this will finally be the last occurrence. Twitter likes to fan speculative flames, but there is no reason to get caught up in the imagination station on this one. Despite his notable progress thus far, Hayward still has a long road ahead in his rehab and recovery, and there is zero incentive to rush the process. Let's put this storyline to bed.

That being said, Gregg Popovich may not opt to play his veteran big man big minutes after spending about a week on the sidelines and the Lakers like a fast-paced game that does not suit Gasol well at this stage of his career. Construct your DFS lineup accordingly.

             Aldridge was previously listed as doubtful, so this does not come as a surprise. Pau Gasol (left knee bone bruise) is probable, so that certainly helps with Aldridge's absence, but the Spurs will likely take a committee approach to filling the LMA void vs. Los Angeles.

             Ingram is still having pain in his groin area, and it's too bad, as Ingram has been playing extremely well of late. Without Ingram available, the Lakers will lean heavily on Kyle Kuzma, while Kentavious Caldwell-Pope and Isaiah Thomas should see more minutes, as well. And without Josh Hart (finger) available, we'd expect Kuzma to start in place of Ingram. We'll have to wait for the MRI results to more definitively establish a potential timetable for Ingram's return to action. Hopefully, it's a day-to-day type of injury, as the Lakers are paper-thin on the wing behind their slender sophomore.

             Johnson and Ellington were expected absences after being unable to practice on Friday, while Adebayo's absence is due to personal reasons. Without either Johnson or Ellington available, Goran Dragic, Dwyane Wade, Josh Richardson, Justise Winslow, and Rodney McGruder will all help fill the void.

             Leonard is in the building, but that's the most notable update we've received in the last week about this ongoing saga. Although Kawhi is supposedly targeting a return sometime in March, we have received no details about when that might be and what limitations might come with it. If you're stashing Leonard, it almost has to be on an IR/IL spot.

            Donovan Mitchell was able to score 26 points across 39 minutes in Friday's victory against the visiting Timberwolves.
        
        
             Mitchell was a solid 10-of-18 from the field, including 2-of-8 from behind the 3-point line, while adding 4-of-5 from the free-throw line. He also added four rebounds, two assists and a steal while turning it over three times. Mitchell has bounced back from a couple of awful performances Feb. 5-7 he is averaging 23.6 PPG with 4.8 RPG, 3.8 APG and 1.4 SPG across the past eight outings. He faces a very favorable matchup Sunday in Sacramento against a Kings team allowing 107.3 PPG.

            Rudy Gobert ended up with a season-high 26 points and a game-high 16 rebounds in 36 minutes Friday against the Timberwolves.
        
        
             Gobert was a very efficient 7-of-9 from the field while going 12-of-14 from the free-throw line, adding an assist, a steal and four blocked shots. He took advantage of the fact Karl-Anthony Towns was hit with his second technical foul in the second quarter, clearing the way for a big game for the Stifle Tower. In fact, it was his 18th double-double of the season, and he already had it before halftime. He and his Utah teammates will be back at it Saturday in Sacramento in another favorable matchup.

             Bjelica hit 3-of-8 from the floor, including 2-of-4 from behind the 3-point line, while adding 4-of-4 from the free-throw line. He was relied upon heavily in the frontcourt with Karl-Anthony Towns getting the boot in the second quarter after a second technical. He'll continue to log heavy minutes with Jimmy Butler (knee) on the mend.

             Dieng was seeing another game with big minutes with Nemanja Bjelica logging plenty of run at small forward. Dieng was used plenty at the four, and he was needed in the middle with Karl-Anthony Towns suffering an ejection early in the game. Despite the uptick in playing time lately Dieng is still only worth using in deeper fantasy leagues at this juncture.

            Taj Gibson (left hip contusion) finished with 12 points in his return to the lineup Friday in Utah.
        
        
             Gibson hit a very efficient 6-of-8 from the field with four rebounds, three assists and a steal across 39 minutes. Coach Tom Thibodeau said before the game that Gibson was feeling much better, and the fact he didn't play with any kind of minutes cap or restrictions means Gibson is officially 100 percent. Unfortunately for his fantasy owners, you'll now have to wait until Thursday until he and his team play again.

            Jeff Teague was ejected in Friday's game at Utah after putting a shoulder into Ricky Rubio and knocking the former Wolves guard to the floor.
        
        
             Teague's play drew praise from the injured Jimmy Butler, who tweeted that he liked what he saw from the guard. Before his ejection he finished with 25 points on 9-of-15 shooting, including 2-of-4 from behind the 3-point line, and he added four rebounds, two assists and two steals. If you want to split hairs, he was just 5-of-8 from the free-throw line to disappoint fantasy owners in roto leagues.

             Wiggins was forced to pick up the slack with Karl-Anthony Towns and Jeff Teague ejected during the testy game, and Jimmy Butler still on the shelf due to injury. He hit 10-of-19 from the field, including a red-hot 4-of-4 from behind the 3-point line, and he finished with three rebounds, an assist and a steal. The only thing fantasy owners could complain about in this one is the 3-of-8 night from the free-throw line and four turnovers.

He is hitting just 33.3 percent (6-of-18) from the floor while averaging 6.0 PPG, 3.0 APG and 2.0 SPG in two outings.

It was a combination of Williams getting a hot hand and Michael Beasley leaving to have his left ankle re-taped.

             Lee ended up hitting 5-of-8 from the field, including 3-of-4 from behind the 3-point line, while adding 2-of-3 from the charity stripe. The points were about all he contributed to the bottom line, as he has just one assist and two turnovers with no other offensive stats. Lee hasn't been doing a terrible job in the scoring department, but he isn't offering much else in other categories. If there is a hot add off the waiver wire, Lee isn't a bad drop option.

             Mudiay was able to salvage the stat line with seven assists, three rebounds and just two turnovers across 26 minutes. He is averaging 5.6 assists per game in seven outings since coming over from the Nuggets, but his shooting has been rather erratic and his scoring totals have yo-yoed. He isn't terribly efficient, but he racks up some counting stats for those in points leagues and DFS play.

It was Kanter's first two-block game since Jan. 30, a span of 11 outings, and it was his first game with at least two steals since Jan. 5 in Miami. He'll look to keep it going on Sunday in Sacramento against the soft middle of the Kings.

He also chipped in with a 3-of-3 night from the free-throw line while adding four assist and three rebounds over 34 minutes. After some offensive struggles in late January into most of February, he has picked up the pace lately.

             Beasley left with a left ankle injury and had it re-taped on the bench and was able to return. He was only able to play 20 minutes, hitting 3-of-7 from the field while going 1-of-2 from the free-throw stripe. Beasley should be able to go for Sunday's game in Sacramento, and he'll have about 48 hours to get better.

             If not for some heroics by Russell Westbrook in the fourth quarter, Booker would be celebrating a win to go with his big night -- he became the third youngest player to reach 4,000 career points (LeBron James and Kevin Durant). He's been on fire with four straight games of 30+ points, the first Suns player to do that since Amar'e Stoudemire in 2004.

             He had five fouls, so he was likely going to play a lot more. Jackson had one of the highlights of the night when he spun around Paul George for a driving layup and is starting to develop some nice chemistry with Devin Booker. ""We knew what would happen,"" Jackson said. ""It was only a matter of time."" He was 8-of-15 from the field and 2-of-5 from the line, but the sky's the limit for him in fantasy when he starts hitting his free throws.

             He must've been feeling good, as he logged a team-high 42 minutes. He finished 8-of-19 from the field and was second only to Devin Booker in shot attempts, so it was business as usual for Warren. The Suns are using him next to Josh Jackson a ton, so both of their outlooks are strong going forward.

             The first technical was justified with a play against Jae Crowder, but the second one was a joke after KAT looked at a ref after what he likely thought was a non-call against Rudy Gobert. Chances are this tech will be rescinded, but Towns isn't in jeopardy of missing games because he's only up to five on the year despite being second in the NBA for total minutes. He'll get a week off with the Wolves being off until Thursday of next week. KAT finished with 13 points, four rebounds, one steal and one 3-pointer in 20 minutes.

             Curry also said he plans to play at Augusta National Park on Saturday, but Curry sure does love his golf and this isn't a surprise.  In case you missed it, he also broke a glass table in his hotel with his seven iron as he was practicing his swing. The Warriors are off until Tuesday, so his fantasy owners should be planning on him being ready.

            Nerlens Noel played 15 minutes vs. the Bulls on Friday, missing all three of his shots and finishing with zero points, six rebounds, one assist, two steals and two blocks.
        
        
             Noel is trying to build his value back up for free agency this summer and coach Rick Carlisle is keeping his word about giving him a chance. ""It's the worst-kept secret in the world that he's playing for a contract - let's be honest,"" Carlisle said. ""And we want him to do well. Hey, we traded for him with the hope that he could be here long term. And sometimes things don't go exactly as planned."" He played 16 minutes in his last game and Carlisle said he ""played with a lot of activity,"" but Dwight Powell is still the better pickup in Dallas for the time being. We'll be watching Noel's minutes closely.

             The Raptors continue to rack up the wins with 10 in their last 11 as they continue to hold a 1.0-game lead over the Celtics for the top spot. Home court advantage will be huge for the Raptors with their NBA-best 25-5 record in The North, so that should mean guys like DeRozan and Kyle Lowry are out there until they're locked in.

             This was arguably his best all-around game since he returned from his concussion apart from his 23-point outburst vs. the Nets. Dunn hit 6-of-12 shots and 3-of-4 free throws, and he has at least one steal, one block and one triple in four out of his last six games with a healthy supply of points, rebounds and assists as well. As long as there's no funny business from the Bulls, Dunn is locked in as mid-round player.

             His playing time didn't really jump up too much from his 18.4 minutes per game, but Miles had the hot hand. This isn't a shock with Miles putting up two 20-point games last month, but he failed to score in double digits in his previous four games. Leave him on the wire because his minutes won't change too much regardless of who is hurt.

             He matched his career-high in assists and this was his second double-double of the season. Nwaba hit 4-of-9 shots and nailed both of his free throws, and he's thriving as a starter with averages of 12.4 points, 8.4 rebounds, 2.2 assists, 1.8 steals and 1.0 triples in 32.6 minutes over his last five. Coach Fred Hoiberg did say that he will make another lineup change for Chicago's next five games, but Bobby Portis moving into the first unit is the only known change so far. With the way Nwaba has been playing, there's no way Hoiberg can justify moving him to the bench.

             He bounced back from his eight-point dud on Wednesday. John Wall (knee) is scheduled to do some on-court work and he could be back in two weeks, but either way Beal should still be a huge part of the offense and may not drop off at all.

             The Bulls have already ruled him out for at least three games down the stretch, as they didn't want to risk playing him in both games of back-to-back sets. LaVine doesn't agree with the decision, but he has no say in the matter. ""I feel great. I want to test it. I want to play as many minutes as possible,"" he said. ""I’m a gamer.

Porter is still just 24 years old and the Wizards clearly are going to need him to play well if they want to advance in the postseason.

             The Bulls are in player evaluation mode and will change up their starting lineup again for the next five games. Portis was the only player mentioned, but it's safe to assume that he'll start alongside Lauri Markkanen which would push Cristiano Felicio to the bench.

             He hit the biggest shot of the game with a  stepback to help the Nuggets avoid what would have been a bad loss. Excluding a dud against the Rockets, Harris has scored at least 23 points in the other four games since the break, and the return of Paul Millsap shouldn't affect him negatively. He's having a breakout season.

            Lance Stephenson scored 16 points with three rebounds, three assists, two steals and one triple in 26 minutes vs. the Bucks on Friday.
        
        
             He took 17 shot attempts which is the third highest mark of his season and also split a pair of free throws. While not the most consistent player, Stephenson is averaging 12.0 points, 5.4 rebounds, 3.7 assists, 0.8 steals and 1.3 triples over his last 10 games and has stepped up with Darren Collison (knee) on the shelf. Collison could be back next week, but Stephenson is worth deploying in 14- and 16-team leagues for the time being.

            Paul Millsap scored 15 points with seven rebounds, one assist, five steals, one block and one 3-pointer in 27 minutes during his start against the Grizzlies on Friday.
        
        
             Coach Mike Malone pulled a fast one on everyone after he said it would be a few more games before he would throw Millsap into the first unit. Well, maybe it's because they lost two games before this win, but either way Millsap is likely here to stay in the first unit. He'll likely be hitting 30 minutes in the near future and he could be an early-round player for his stat-stuffing ways.

             Joseph was coming off a zero-point dud in an ugly loss vs. the Hawks on Wednesday but took full responsibility after. ""I wasn’t making the right reads,"" Joseph said. ""It’s my job to settle everybody down, get everybody in the right spots. I just didn’t have a good game. We just have to bounce back. That’s this league. You got to focus mentally, come out with a lot of energy next game."" He was much better tonight and ended up playing a team-high 41 minutes. There's a chance Darren Collison (knee) could be back when the Pacers finish up their road trip this weekend, so Joseph's low-end value has an expiration date.

             The Denver free-flowing offense was part of the reason Jokic was on fire coming into this game, but now he'll have to adjust playing next to Paul Millsap again. He had a tougher time with Marc Gasol tonight and he couldn't get into a rhythm offensively. His owners shouldn't be worried at all.

             He was really starting to find a rhythm as the starting power forward, but now he'll have to adjust to the three spot. Chandler was brutal to start the year next to Paul Millsap, so his fantasy owners may want to see how he does his next time out. He was really hot before this dud, so giving him another chance makes sense.

             His minutes and production have been all over the place lately, as coach Nate McMillan will roll with Domantas Sabonis when he has the hot hand. Turner hit 4-of-6 shots and 5-of-7 free throws in 30 minutes, and while he'll never live up to his ADP this season, he's comfortably returning top-50 value with lots of room to grow.

             The homecoming game narrative strikes again for the University of Memphis product. He's one of the best sixth men in the league and he will be getting his shot attempts when he's on the floor. Barton looks like he'll still be able to hit around 30 minutes even when Paul Millsap's minutes cap is gone, so he should still be fired up in all fantasy leagues.

             After dropping two games against the tanking Mavs and Hawks, the Pacers got back on track tonight. Oladipo was cold from beyond the arc entering tonight's game, hitting just 1-of-12 attempts in his last two outings. ""You give me that shot nine more times, I think I'm going to make it eight,"" Oladipo said. ""Obviously, I haven't been shooting it great from 3. I'm aware of that. I just got to keep working on it. Shoot with confidence -- don't think about it and just let it fly."" He did exactly that on Friday, hitting 9-of-19 shots and 2-of-6 triples. He's been a top-10 player this season and isn't slowing down.

It wasn't necessarily his fault in his 36 minutes, scoring 22 points with nine rebounds, five assists, three 3-pointers and seven turnovers. With Gasol out, it'll likely be Ivan Rabb, Jarell Martin and whoever else is healthy against the Magic. We might see more Brice Johnson, too.

             That's his second game of the season with at least two steals, two blocks and two triples. Bledsoe is third in the NBA in steals per game and has been on fire from beyond the arc, hitting at least two triples in 11 straight games. His owners can also look forward to using him in the fantasy playoffs unlike last season when the Suns abruptly shut him down for tanking reasons -- That's not happening in Milwaukee with the Bucks fighting for playoff seeding.

             He's been really bad lately, but McLemore had his best game in a while. The Grizzlies are going to be resting some players tomorrow, but it's still really tough to count on the former King.

            Giannis Antetokounmpo (eye) struggled from the field on Friday vs. the Pacers, hitting 6-of-18 shots and 10-of-12 free throws for 24 points, 10 rebounds, three assists, one steal, three blocks and two triples in 43 minutes.
        
        
             February was his worst month of the season in terms of scoring (22.6 points) and rebounding (9.8 rebounds), but he vowed to be more aggressive like we saw tonight. ""I think I've tried to move the ball because I've been playing a lot of point guard with the second group,"" Antetokounmpo said. ""Trying to move the ball, make the right plays. But I've probably got to change my mentality. I've got to be who I am by nature and be more aggressive."" While his shot wasn't falling tonight, expect to see Giannis take matters into his own hands to get the Bucks back on track -- they've lost four straight games and are sliding in the East.

             Those dimes and steals set a career-high for the rook. He could be looking at a big opportunity on Saturday with Marc Gasol getting the night off and Deyonta Davis still banged up. If Davis and JaMychal Green (illness) are out, Rabb is a decent streamer and DFS punt.

             He made his return for the first time since Feb. 10 and the Grizzlies did indeed keep his minutes down. Maybe Selden gets his minutes increased on Saturday, but of course he could also get the night off. Leave him on the wire until we find out what the plan is for Saturday.

             The Warriors come through on the road yet again with three in a row on their East Coast swing, upping them to an NBA-high 25 wins away from Oracle. Durant has actually been killer on the road with higher points, boards, and FG% on the road. He's coming off a ridiculous February shooting line of 61/53/89 to get him to a 74.9 TS% as he continues to carry the team -- Stephen Curry (ankle) was hurt tonight. He's been at an MVP level lately as the Warriors remain in a virtual tie with the Rockets for the top seed. The Rockets hold the important tiebreaker, which could be big to keep the Warriors away from the dreaded DNP-REST.

             He did have a costly turnover on the last key offensive possession of the game with the Hawks down three. Andre Iguodala stole his cookies and it led to a breakaway dunk give the Warriors a five-point lead. Hey, maybe the Hawks aren't too upset with that as they move into a tie for the No. 2 spot in the lottery. The Hawks only have two more back-to-back sets the rest of the way, so hopefully Bazemore can avoid the DNP-REST.

             It appears Johnson and Richaun Holmes are fighting for scraps in the frontcourt since the addition of Ersan Ilyasova. Last night it was Holmes with the DNP-CD, Friday it was Johnson. Neither is particularly attractive from a fantasy perspective, even in deeper leagues, as long as Ilyasova, Joel Embiid and Dario Saric remain healthy.

             Assuming they aren't rested, this means Kosta Koufos and Zach Randolph could pick up some run at the five, and this also means Skal Labissiere could get an extended look. In terms of fantasy, Labissiere is probably the best pickup out of those three long term, as Z-Bo and Koufos are going to rack up a lot of DNPs.

For now, Holmes and Johnson are only worth keeping around in deeper fantasy leagues as long as Ilyasova, Joel Embiid and Dario Saric are healthy.

He also added five rebounds, three assists and three steals for the all-around solid evening. He was one of three Philly starters (Joel Embiid, JJ Redick) to post a plus-19 rating in the victory. He'll look to keep up the good work Sunday in Milwaukee.

            Dewayne Dedmon scored six points with seven rebounds, one assist and two steals in 32 minutes against the Warriors on Friday.
        
        
             He somehow made 2-of-10 from the field with only three shots from deep, but at least the minutes are there. Dedmon is coming off a monster 15-point, four-block Wednesday and for now it looks like the Hawks are going to play him regularly. He's worth a look if you need a big man who canned some defensive stats.

             The runway is clear for the high-flying rookie and he should be able to hit 30 minutes in games he avoids foul trouble. Collins is locked in as a must-own player the rest of the way and he's been productive on blocks with six blocks in his four games since the break.

             Saric didn't have a giant stat line, but he helped fantasy owners in multiple categories while turning in just one turnover. His production was down, particularly on the offensive end, due to five personal fouls. He'll look to get back into double digits in the points department when the Sixers head to Cream City on Sunday to tangle with the Bucks.

             Simmons hit 6-of-10 from the field and 3-of-4 from the free-throw stripe, and he was one of four starters with a plus-10 rating or better. He has posted double-digit point totals in 19 consecutive outings, and he has five or more assists in 21 straight contests dating back to Jan. 18. He just contributes a little bit of everything to endear himself to fantasy owners.

             Embiid absolutely embarrassed veteran Dwight Howard in this one, as Howard mustered very little on offense while spending the night in foul trouble most of the evening. The only bad thing to happen to Embiid was when he appeared to hurt his lower back on a hard foul. However, he stood up by himself and remained in the game, waving off head coach Brett Brown. It was another back-to-back for Embiid, too, and he made it through mostly unscathed. He should just fine for Sunday's game in Milwaukee.

             MCW was an ugly 0-of-6 from the field, hitting 2-of-4 from the free-throw line for his only points of the evening. Carter-Williams continues to yo-yo lately, as he followed up a decent game with an absolute stinker, a trend we've seen over the past week to 10 days. He remains useful only in the very deepest of fantasy formats at this time.

             It was easily his best game since returning from a hip injury and he caught fire early with 15 points in the first eight minutes. Gordon's playing time hasn't really skipped a beat after his return last Thursday, and he's starting to rack up the defensive stats over his last three with five blocks and six steals in that span. As long as the Magic don't pull a Chicago, Gordon should be OK as a must-start player.

             The rust was there in a big way in the first half, but Isaac really got it going in the fourth with a steal and an impressive block on a 3-pointer off a switch. He's one of the most impressive defensive playmakers among rookies and his minutes could trend up. He's worth a look in deeper leagues.

             He's starting to heat up again after it looked like his minutes were heading south on Saturday due to the Magic rolling out some no-PG lineups. The Magic do have a surplus of forwards right now and that lineup could be on the table, but maybe Augustin can keep it going. He's worth a look if you need shooting PG, but keep in mind he'll have some duds.

Joel Embiid got the best of the veteran, as Howard hit managed just five rebounds, two assists and no blocked shots with five personal fouls in his 25 minutes. To add insult to injury, Howard was a dismal 0-of-4 from the free-throw line, too. He'll look for better results Sunday in Toronto.

             That's the second game in a row Blake has knocked on the door for a triple-double, but struggled as a scorer. The Pistons also fell apart in OT with just two points to give them yet another loss. Before this game as a Piston, Blake made just 39.6 percent from the field and he's lost his touch on his jumper. Griffin's value lies in him scoring the rock, so his fantasy owners will need to see him improve on efficiency, especially with his high volume from the floor.

            Jeremy Lamb finished with eight points, one rebound and one steal across 20 minutes off the bench in Friday's game at Philadelphia.
        
        
             Lamb hit 3-of-7 from the field, including 1-of-2 from deep, but his playing time took a hit with Michael Kidd-Gilchrist (hamstring) back in action. He was averaging 26.0 minutes per game over the past two outings. His point total was his lowest since Feb. 8, snapping a four-game streak with double digits. He remains useful in 12-team fantasy leagues even when he is coming off the bench.

             He's getting a ton of shots right now to help open up the offense.

He's not the sexiest asset in fantasy, but he is producing.

             Make that two really bad games in a row for Smith. Reggie Jackson went through a pre-game workout again today and it feels like Jackson should be back at some point in the middle of this month. If you care more about the last month of the season, you may want to evaluate where Smith fits in for your plans.

             Coach Stan Van Gundy seems to like this lineup with Ennis starting and the Pistons did trade for him for a reason. He has size to guard some fours and he's a better floor spacer to take some pressure of the other perimeter guys. Ennis still likely won't get many shots on this roster, so he's only worth a look in deeper leagues.

             MKG hit 4-of-9 from the field, but he turned in just one rebound, one assist and one steal with three turnovers while committing five personal fouls. He appeared to be tentative at times, and wasn't quite 100 percent. Still, his minutes were way higher than anticipated coming back from injury and it appears safe to get him back into the active fantasy lineup in deeper leagues if you normally rely upon him.

             Even though he had a triple-double back on Jan. 31 in Atlanta, this might have been his best game of the season. He was an efficient 5-of-9 from the field, including 3-of-5 from downtown, and his 13 boards were a season high. After looking like a shell of himself in the first few months, mostly attributed due to a torn left elbow ligament suffered back in early October, he is starting to heat up. Over the past seven games he is averaging 11.2 points, 8.7 assists, 6.6 rebounds and 1.7 steals per outing. He has at least one steal in 10 consecutive games, too.

             He tweaked his ankle in the first quarter as he stepped on Zaza Pachulia's foot, but did return and looked fine in the second quarter. In fact, Curry scored 11 points in just over two minutes after his return, so presumably this is just a precaution to keep him out tonight. Curry still finished with a nice line of 28 points, one rebound, three assists, two steals and four 3-pointers in24 minutes. The Warriors are off until Tuesday, so Curry may not miss additional time.

Gallinari's first season in L.A. has almost been a lost cause as he's struggled to stay on the floor. His fantasy owners should just drop him at this point. The Clippers will roll with plenty of three-guard lineups while he's out while Montrezl Harrell also benefits.

This is the same ankle that kept him out for about a month to end 2017, so you can bet the Warriors will be extremely careful here. To be clear, this ankle issue didn't look too bad.

             He was a disaster in his last start and lasted just nine minutes, but let's see if he can step up with Memphis missing several players including Andrew Harrison (wrist). McLemore can be left on the wire until further notice.

             This was quicker than expected, but his fantasy owners aren't complaining. Millsap still has a 24-minute limit, but that number should go up soon. He looked great on Tuesday, scoring nine points (4-of-10 FGs) with seven rebounds, two assists, one steal, two blocks and one triple in 23 minutes.

             They will join Dillon Brooks and Marc Gasol in the first unit. Andrew Harrison (wrist) is sitting out tonight, but he's considered day-to-day. Chalmers has some short-term streaming appeal, averaging 9.0 points, 5.4 assists, 4.0 rebounds, 2.1 steals and 0.9 triples in seven previous starts. We may even see Kobi Simmons get some run tonight with so many injuries in Memphis.

             The Lakers gave him a 4-6 week timetable and there are less than six weeks left in the regular season, so his rookie campaign could be over. Isaiah Thomas logged 19 minutes alongside Lonzo Ball in two-PG lineups on Thursday, something we'll see more of going forward. Several other players get a bump in minutes as well such as Kyle Kuzma (played some SF Thursday), Julius Randle and Kentavious Caldwell-Pope.

             T.J. Warren is back after a bruise to his bottom and it doesn't sound like Warren will be limited in his start. Jackson has played too well for the Suns to keep his minutes down, so he could find himself getting minutes at three-plus positions. He is still a hold in all leagues.

             He had surgery a month ago and this timetable is right in line with the 6-8 week timetable he was given right after surgery. Wall is expected to begin light shooting any day now, and while he's reportedly ahead of schedule, the Wizards will obviously be cautious. The good news is that this means he could return in time to help his owners in the fantasy playoffs. In the meantime, Tomas Satoransky and Bradley Beal will continue to share the ball-handling duties.

With Harrison out, it should be Mario Chalmers and Wayne Selden running most of the PG minutes while Kobi Simmons and Ben McLemore could also fill in. The Grizzlies also play tomorrow.

             He was poked in the eye on Wednesday vs. Detroit, but he was originally listed as probable and his status wasn't in any real danger. Deploy him like you normally would and expect big things going forward with the Bucks jostling for playoff position.

             He was a game-time call and the Hornets look like they ruled him out after warmups. With him out, Willy Hernangomez could get another chance after a rough night on Wednesday, or the Hornets could go smaller with Frank Kaminsky at the five to open up some power forward minutes.

             He traveled with the team today and is getting over his hamstring soreness. The Celtics players and coaches have really praised Greg Monroe lately, so the team may just be careful with Theis to keep him healthy down the line. Even if Theis is out, it'll still be risky to use Monroe for big minutes against a team like Houston.

             He is also dealing with a minor shoulder injury, but Tony Parker said Aldridge's shoulder is ""nothing serious."" Aldridge had an MRI on his ankle on Thursday, but he is only day-to-day. That said, it looks like the Spurs will be sitting him out for at least one game. If Pau Gasol (knee) also can't go, that should mean Joffrey Lauvergne picks up most of the center minutes while Davis Bertans, Kyle Anderson and Rudy Gay also benefit. Gay is the best pickup followed by Lauvergne until LMA is back.

             The Blazers missed Harkless for the last three quarters on Thursday, which allowed Shabazz Napier to score 16 points in 27 minutes. Harkless is dealing with a mild patellar tendon strain and he said he could have played through it in a postseason game, so he's likely just day-to-day. Napier could be in a good spot overall, but the matchup isn't great against OKC's size.

Expect Taj to be a game-time call for a late start.

            Hassan Whiteside said he has been told to put his knee brace back on after he played without it on Thursday.
        
        
             Maybe this is part of the reason he only played 19 minutes on Thursday. Whiteside was starting to heat up at the end of February with 34 minutes in two of his final three games last month. He'll likely be seeing minutes per game in the 22-28 range now that Kelly Olynyk is back.

Nick Young could see some extra playing time on Friday, and the Warriors may ask Kevin Durant to facilitate the offense more frequently.

            Ryan Anderson (hip soreness) has been ruled out of Saturday's game vs. Boston.
        
        
             Anderson has missed each of the Rockets last two games, and the fact that he is getting ruled out a day ahead of Saturday's contest is not overly encouraging. Trevor Ariza, Luc Mbah a Moute, and P.J. Tucker will continue to divvy up additional minutes with Anderson sidelined.

             Isaac hasn't played in a game since re-injuring his ankle the day after Christmas. The Magic have erred in the side of caution, in order to make sure he is as close to 100 percent as possible. Isaac will likely see playing time on the wing and at power forward. However, he'll be on a minutes restriction over his first handful of games, so his fantasy value is capped.

             You can't make this stuff up, folks. The jokes will continue for the rest of the season and beyond, but Smith won't miss any more time. Coach Ty Lue told reporters on Thursday that Smith will return to practice Friday and start at shooting guard on Saturday when the Cavs host the Nuggets. Rodney Hood will get bumped back to the bench.

             With Noah not agreeing to a buyout by March 1st, it is extremely unlikely he will agree to one before the end of this season. Thus, both sides will reaccess their options this offseason. If New York fires Jeff Hornecek this summer, there is a greater likelihood that Noah would return for the 2018-19 campaign. Either way, Noah has no fantasy value over the next six weeks.

             He had a brutal start to this game and almost had his second field goal-less half of the season before his layup at 1:46 left in the second quarter -- he missed his first nine shots. Lillard caught fire in the second half with 23 points, but that's nothing new at all for him. In fact, Lillard has scored more than 21 points in five of his last seven second halves. Lillard time is real and it's spectacular as he has helped his team get to a five-game winning streak.

            Evan Turner started the third quarter against the Wolves on Thursday, failing to score with one board and six assists in 22 minutes.
        
        
             It sounds like Moe Harkless is going to miss time, but Turner himself isn't 100 percent as he fights through a toe injury. Turner needs serious volume to have an impact and he won't get it while Dame Lillard and C.J. McCollum are healthy. He's not really an option in most leagues.

             Nurk got worked by Karl-Anthony Towns while Ed Davis had a good showing, so that explains the minutes. Nurkic still had a decent game today and his minutes have been up, so there's no reason to worry.

             For whatever reason, the Wolves went away from KAT in the final six minutes to allow the Blazers to pull a comeback win. Towns has some eye-popping averages over his last three games without Jimmy Butler, averaging 27.3 points, 15.7 boards, 2.7 dimes, 1.3 steals, 2.0 blocks and 0.3 treys on 59.2 percent from the field and 88.5 percent from the line. While KAT, Andrew Wiggins and Taj Gibson have played more games than anyone else in the NBA, KAT should feast the rest of the way.

             Make it four straight games with more than 20 points for Wiggins with 2.0 treys per game over that span, too. Wiggins has a 4.9 usage rate bump when he's not with Jimmy Butler (knee), so he'll be a good bet for 20-plus points more often than not.

             The minutes are going to increase slightly because Nemanja Bjelica will be playing small forward to open up minutes at the four. Dieng has still be extremely quiet on the stat sheet, so he's hardly an add until he shows up on paper.

             This is probably the Crawford you're going to see more often than not and his fantasy value is tied directly to how he shoots the ball, making just 5-of-13 today. He doesn't do enough outside of scoring to be considered as a reliable option in most leagues.

             Coach Tom Thibodeau continues to play his starters together a ton, so that should lock Bjelica into heavy minutes. He hasn't quite hit his stride on offense, but he's been strong on the glass and in non-scoring areas. He should be owned in standard leagues while Jimmy Butler (knee) is on the shelf.

             The Kings are finally starting to play Bogdan and Buddy Hield consistently together, and both came up with clutch buckets late. Hield started slow, but managed to finish with 16 points, four rebounds, four assists, three steals and one 3-pointer in 35 minutes. Both players are worth owning in standard leagues as the Kings take a very long look at both in March and April.

             He hit a baseline floater at the buzzer to help get this game to overtime. Fox continues to make key plays late in games and somewhat surprisingly it took coach Dave Joerger a little longer to put Fox back in for the fourth. That aside, his minutes are back and he's finally healthy again, so expect the Kings to lean on him a ton in the final six weeks of the season.

The Kings are headed towards a full youth movement, so Mason should start seeing 20 minutes more often. He's only a low-end asset in deep leagues until he starts to get into a rhythm.

             He had a solid game all around and he started the overtime frame. Labissiere still has some tape over his shoulder that bothered him for the start of 2018 until the break, so hopefully it doesn't come back to bite him. He's one of the most inconsistent players in the league, but he has some upside if you can deal with the peaks and valleys.

             After a really slow start, ice was in his veins with a strong shooting fourth quarter to help the Nets go on a 10-2 run to get it to OT. While the shots weren't falling, Russell's decision making has been much better these days. He had some serious turnover bugaboos when he returned from injury, and coach Kenny Atkinson also said he wanted DAR to dime more. His minutes are there and he's shaken off most of the rust, so Russell could have himself a strong finish.

Allen continues to get his dunks with three in the first quarter tonight to get him rolling.

             He still has a soft minutes cap on him and he's yet to have a big game since his groin injury. Hollis-Jefferson is starting to play more small forward and his minutes could start to trend up in the near future. He's still a hold in 12-team leagues.

             Even with the quiet game, he still had the ball in his hands to get two made free throws with six seconds left to get a two-point lead. His stats have taken a severe hit lately, averaging 9.6 points, 3.4 boards, 8.4 dimes, 1.0 steals and 1.4 treys over his previous five. Some of that could be due to D'Angelo Russell handling the ball more, but most of it is on Dinwiddie making just 32.7 percent from the field in his previous five. He'll heat up soon, so keep firing him up in all standard leagues.

             The reemergence of D'Angelo Russell hasn't hurt Crabbe at all as he continues to hoist almost 10 attempts from deep per game these days. He's probably going to have a lot of bad FG% games, but Crabbe could be a top-10 player for 3-pointers the rest of the way. He should be owned in standard leagues.

             He hit one of the biggest shots of the game with a game-tying 3-pointer with 29 seconds left. Carroll continues to thrive as the starting stretch four, and getting the overtime minutes helped buoy his playing time overall. He's playing too well for his owners to worry about a change in playing time now that the Nets are healthy again.

Hopefully it's just some minor inflammation and he can return to action this weekend.

             LBJ averaged a triple-double in February, so this is nothing new. He recently won Player of the Month honors for the 37th time in his career, which means he's won 43% of all Eastern Conference Player of the Month awards since joining the NBA, according to ESPN Stats & Info. Maybe he gets bored being so dominant, as he split a double-team with a ridiculous behind-the-back dribble tonight that sent the ball through his own teammates' legs before he collected it again (see link below). Long live the King.

             Clarkson apparently felt Saric was running up the score with 12.2 seconds left, and he tossed the ball into his lower back. Clarkson was immediately ejected but nothing else came of the altercation, so presumably the league will let him go with just a fine. If you're relying on him for Saturday's game vs. Denver, though, it can't hurt to confirm his status before tip-off.

The Cavs still hold the No. 3 seed in the East, but tonight's loss means the No. 6 seed Sixers are just 2.5 games behind them. For fantasy purposes, of course, Green has nothing to merit ownership.

             J.R. Smith was suspended one game for conduct detrimental to the team, so this shouldn't have lasting implication for either Smith or Hood. He's fallen from 16.8 points per game with Utah to a modest 11.2 points with Cleveland, largely because of decreased shot attempts and usage, and it's hard to see that changing while the Cavs are healthy.

             Cleveland is 5-3 since overhauling their roster at the trade deadline, which is solid considering all their new pieces and the absence of injured All-Star Kevin Love (hand). They'll need more consistent production from Hill, though, as he's yet to score double-digit points in consecutive games for the Cavs. His 2.5 assists are the lowest since 2010-11, his 2.3 rebounds the lowest since his rookie year, and he's by no means must-own at this point.

             Redick made 7-of-11 field goals and 4-of-6 free throws in 29 minutes, and he seemingly had an answer for every basket Cleveland scored down the stretch. This follows up a rough two-game stretch in which he shot 6-of-24 from the field, so it was nice to see the sharp-shooter get back on track.

            Shabazz Muhammad plans to commit to the Bucks when he clears waivers, according to Shams Charania of Yahoo! Sports.
        
        
             That didn't take long after he was officially waived less than an hour ago. Muhammad hasn't even been able to get minutes while Jimmy Butler (knee) has been out, and he'll have to earn his playing time on his new team. There is an opportunity for him because he'll be competing with Sterling Brown, Sean Kilpatrick and Tony Snell for minutes. Still, there's no need to add Muhammad in almost any fantasy league.

             Whiteside made 1-of-4 FGs and 4-of-4 FTs without any assists, steals or blocks, and was torched no matter who he tried to defend. Miami initially stuck him on Julius Randle, to prevent him from being pulled out of the paint by Brook Lopez's 3-point range, but Randle proceeded to exploit him anyway. Whiteside's owners are used to random duds at this point, and he should fare better vs. Andre Drummond and the Pistons on Saturday.

             Olynyk and Hassan Whiteside came in with a -10 net rating in 168 minutes together this season, and the pairing flopped again -- Miami gave up 73 first-half points, and Olynyk was replaced by Bam Adebayo to start the third quarter. There was simply no cohesion to the lineups he was in, and it's doubtful we'll see him starting again on Saturday, even if Johnson is out again.

            Dwyane Wade stayed hot on Thursday with 25 points on 11-of-18 shooting, three rebounds, three assists and one 3-pointer, but it wasn't enough to avoid a lopsided loss to the Lakers.
        
        
             Wade shot 6-of-6 in the first half tonight, helping to keep the Heat competitive despite coughing up 73 points through two quarters. He came in averaging 22.6 minutes with the Heat this season, and they aren't likely to give him much more than that -- especially if he continues to play in back-to-back sets. His two-game hot stretch aside, most owners have higher-upside players at their disposal.

             Adebayo and James Johnson turned the game around early when they subbed in for Hassan Whiteside and Kelly Olynyk, with Adebayo's energy helping to spark a 13-2 run in Miami's favor. It didn't last, but he was rewarded with the starting nod after halftime. The rookie paid off for adventurous fantasy owners with a strong all-around line that included four offensive boards and efficient shooting, but his tumultuous role makes him hard to own outside of deep leagues.

             It looked like Ingram took a shot below the belt from Justise Winslow, but apparently there's additional damage. This is somewhat discouraging news on Ingram because there wasn't too much concern about him being ruled out during the blowout win in the fourth quarter on Thursday. The Lakers will likely update his status in the next day or so. If he's out, Kyle Kuzma could play more small forward while the Lakers would likely have to call upon Tyler Ennis to fill some minutes.

He erupted for 19 points prior to the All-Star break, and scored 14 points on Feb. 23, but since then he's averaged just 6.7 points, 2.0 rebounds 1.3 assists and 0.3 steals, without any blocks. Most owners should just watch him until his playing time increases.

             The Lakers were cruising to an easy win when Ingram went down, so hopefully his absence was simply due to the garbage time. Justise Winslow appeared to knee him in the groin as Ingram went up for a shot, and owners should sit tight for more details about the injury -- it's worth noting that he dealt with some right groin tightness earlier in February. The Lakers get a day off before facing the Spurs in San Antonio, so we'll consider Ingram questionable for that game.

             This almost certainly means another DNP-CD is coming for Randolph tonight, with Skal Labissiere taking his spot in the starting lineup. The constant threat of a DNP is enough reason to cut Z-Bo loose in typical leagues.

            Skal Labissiere is starting over Zach Randolph against the Nets on Thursday.
        
        
             Skal was listed on the injury report for an ankle sprain, but he should be fine for this favorable matchup. With Z-Bo possibly getting the night off, Labissiere could find himself getting minutes in the upper 20s. On the other hand, he's about as unpredictable as they come, so coach Dave Joerger could keep him on a short leash. He's worth a look in some leagues, but he's likely going to be annoying to own with ups and downs.

             Just yesterday, coach Tom Thibodeau said the Wolves wouldn't buy out Muhammad's contract, saying, ""Nope, we live the team we have."" Nevertheless, he hasn't been in the rotation since November, not even with Jimmy Butler getting hurt recently, so it makes sense for Minnesota to part ways with him. He reportedly hopes to join a playoff contender, and is a longshot to reclaim fantasy relevance this season.

Green was held out of action on Tuesday due to soreness, so he could be back up to his normal 22.1 minutes per game on the season. He'll be an option as a DFS punt play, but doesn't have much value in standard leagues.

Harrison is coming off a 20-point game on Wednesday and he would be looking at another big opportunity in the first unit. If he can't go, it'll likely be down to Mario Chalmers and Kobi Simmons, assuming Wayne Selden (knee) also can't go.

They're on an NBA-high active losing streak of 11 games and they're getting close to being at the top of the lottery. Andrew Harrison (wrist) is also dinged up, so the Grizzlies may have to turn to Mario Chalmers, Wayne Selden (knee) and Kobi Simmons.

             This will be his third game off and his second season hasn't gone well due to a slew of different injuries. With him out, Tyler Dorsey and basically the rest of the rotation will pick up a few extra minutes.

             It's possible he could return for this game, but the Suns do want to develop their younger bigs. Alex Len has been struggling lately, but his opportunity is big enough to own him in standard leagues.

             He'll likely be a game-time decision after missing Wednesday. Warren basically has a bruise on his rear, so it's likely a pain tolerance issue. Of course, the Suns did win last night, so they actually lost their No. 1 spot in the lottery and may not want to play Warren at less than 100 percent. Josh Jackson benefits most and is coming off a career night.

             He suffered the injury in the first half on Wednesday and he was able to play through it at first, but he eventually went to the locker room and was ruled out before the start of the second half. The Spurs likely won't be in a hurry to bring Aldridge back and he could miss time with what looks like a minor injury. With him out, it'll be Rudy Gay, Kyle Anderson, Joffrey Lauvergne and Davis Bertans handling the minutes up front. Gay is likely the best add of the bunch.

             The Magic will have some added depth at power forward with Aaron Gordon and Mario Hezonja already playing well there. Hezonja is expected to play ""a lot"" of minutes according to coach Frank Vogel, so maybe that means the Magic start running out more no-PG lineups like they did on Saturday. As for Isaac, he'll probably have a minutes limit and it could be a handful of games before the team leans on him heavily.

             He has missed five games and the Nuggets have been trying to limit his days on the roster to cut down on the 45-day cap on his two-way deal. For now, he's probably going to stay in the G League for a little while.

             Hamstring injuries can linger, so the Hornets may continue to be cautious after holding him out vs. Boston on Wednesday. Treveon Graham started in his absence but was very quiet with two points in 30 minutes, while Jeremy Lamb had 10 points, two boards, one block and two triples in 25 minutes off the bench. Even though it wasn't a good game for him, Lamb is a much better fantasy asset than MKG and Graham.

             This move was inevitable after Josh Hart fractured his wrist. Coach Luke Walton said Ball ""looked good"" at Wednesday's practice and his minutes restrictions are expected to be lifted to 30. He's been solid in his first two games back, averaging 11.0 points, 7.0 rebounds, 5.5 assists, 1.5 steals and 3.0 triples, shooting a combined 7-of-12 from the field and 2-of-2 from the line.

            Corey Brewer has committed to join the Thunder once he clears waivers on Friday.
        
        
             Brewer was reportedly linked to three Eastern Conference teams as well, but he made up his mind after speaking with Thunder coach Billy Donovan and GM Sam Presti. Brewer will strengthen OKC's second unit and his arrival means the Thunder won't have to rely on Terrance Ferguson, Josh Huestis and Alex Abrines as much. Brewer won't have much fantasy in OKC.

Rodney McGruder may also get a few minutes. Ellington has been a terrific 3-point specialist, but owners in 12-team leagues may need to drop him for a hot free agent.

             Both players are day-to-day with quad contusions. Dwyane Wade will be asked to step up again after his big 27-point performance on Tuesday, and we can expect heavy workloads for Goran Dragic and Josh Richardson. Justise Winslow is a candidate to start and Rodney McGruder might also pick up a handful of minutes in his second game back, but both players are hard to trust in fantasy, especially McGruder.

It's not clear how coach Brett Brown plans to use him, but it's hard to imagine him taking a lot of minutes away from Dario Saric with the way he's been playing. Ilyasova is not a fantasy pickup for now.

             The Grizzlies didn't win a single game in February and are on an 11-game losing streak. ""It's not about somebody playing well or getting your reps or developing players because we have a league for that,"" Gasol said. ""We have a league and a team here in Memphis to develop guys. ... This is the NBA, not the G League."" He's clearly not happy that he's on a tanking team and you have to wonder why he wasn't more vocal before the trade deadline so the Grizzlies would at least consider moving him. His fantasy owners could be in for a bumpy ride to the finish line.

             In case you missed it, LMA left Wednesday's game vs. the Pelicans early and was quickly ruled out for the remainder of the contest. The Spurs are one of the most cautious teams in the NBA, so that may have factored into their decision as well. With Pau Gasol dealing with a bone bruise in his knee, the Spurs could be very shorthanded on Saturday vs. the Lakers. Look for Joffrey Lauvergne and Davis Bertans to step up if Aldridge or Gasol can't go.

Boban's per-minute upside isn't in question, but he has more DNPs (38) than combined assists, steals and blocks (28).

             Tyrone Wallace was assigned to the G League, which left L.A.'s backcourt thin without Avery Bradley (groin) and Jawun Evans (abdomen). C.J. Williams started at SG tonight, while Sindarius Thornwell logged 14 minutes off the bench, but Teodosic is still just a borderline add if you need 3-pointers and assists. In his first NBA season, the 30-year-old PG is shooting 39.4% from the field with 5.0 assists, 3.1 rebounds, 0.5 steals and 0.1 blocks.

The defensive stats are promising but his role is built on quicksand -- the moment Tyrone Wallace (G League), Avery Bradley (groin) or Danilo Gallinari (hand) return, he'll vanish from sight.

             Harris is averaging a mere 1.1 turnovers per game, so it was surprising to see him cough up a season-high six turnovers tonight. Regardless, he's averaging a career-high 18.1 points and has out-performed Blake Griffin since the trade in nearly every fantasy format. Harris' owners are playing with house money at this point.

             Gordon wound up missing three games with his ailment, but the Rockets just kept rolling along without him, extending their win streak to 14 straight with tonight's victory. Gordon has struggled after a scorching start to the season (mostly as a starter without Chris Paul), but there's cause for optimism -- the Rockets join the Pelicans and Raptors as the only teams with four games in Weeks 21, 22 and 23.

             That improves Houston's record to 48-13, and they'll need just 11 wins in their next 21 games to pass the 1993-94 Rockets for the best record in franchise history. Paul continues to fill up the stat sheet nightly, which has taken the sting out of his minor shooting slump -- he's a combined 19-of-50 from the field (38.0%) since the All-Star break. Next on the schedule is a home game vs. Kyrie Irving and the Celtics on Saturday.

             LaMarcus Aldridge didn't return after spraining his right ankle, and Pau Gasol (knee) was already unavailable, so Lauvergne became a default starter after halftime.

             Moore hit one 3-pointer with just one turnover, helping New Orleans reel off their seventh consecutive victory. ""Right now, everybody's playing their part,"" said Anthony Davis. ""Everybody thought we were going to go down in the standings [without DeMarcus Cousins]. We're actually moving up."" Moore has had some nice moments this season, but he's little more than a steals-and-threes specialist in fantasy.

             Nikola Mirotic started the second half and this is one reason owners can't trust Okafor -- his role varies nightly based on the opponent. The Spurs were without Pau Gasol (knee) and they lost LaMarcus Aldridge (ankle) early, so Okafor was simply a poor fit as the Spurs went smaller. There's no reason to own him in most situations.

             Harrison has been a bright spot in a gloomy season, and tonight's effort was nice to see after he shot a combined 1-of-9 from deep with zero defensive stats in his previous three games. Just be prepared for a dip in his numbers when Tyreke Evans (ribs) returns -- he's day-to-day and his return will be based on pain tolerance, according to coach J.B. Bickerstaff.

             The veteran shot 7-of-21 from the field and 6-of-7 from the line, while sinking a pair of 3-pointers. The Grizzlies just keep losing, with their record now at 18-42, and beat writer Ronald Tillery recently suggested that ""Gasol likely won’t play in back-to-back sets the rest of this season."" That's more of an opinion than a report, but it's hard to fault the logic. Gasol's owners should prepare for some turbulence in the coming weeks.

             Martin initially came off the bench with Ben McLemore moving to the starting unit, but that didn't last long. This was one of his best fantasy lines all season, but it came against the Suns in a game that Tyreke Evans (ribs) and Deyonta Davis (left ankle) both missed. Martin doesn't have any double-doubles this season, and he hasn't hit multiple 3-pointers in consecutive games, to name a few more caveats. He's only a proactive pickup in deep leagues.

             To be clear, this wasn't a merit-based promotion for McLemore. As Grizzlies writer Peter Edmiston wrote on Monday, ""In the month of February, the Grizzlies have a net rating of -29.4 when Ben McLemore is on the court."" He was benched in favor of Jarell Martin to start the second half, too, so this was likely just a temporary experiment vs. a small Suns team. There's nothing to see here for fantasy purposes.

             Brooks has been asked to play more shooting guard this month, and it hasn't gone well. He was shooting 49.6% from the field in January, but is at just 36.4% in February. That could be one reason coach J.B. Bickerstaff tried to start Ben McLemore at SG tonight, but that experiment didn't last long. There's no reason to own Brooks in re-draft leagues while he's struggling this badly.

            Al Horford was quiet during Wednesday's home win, scoring five points with four assists, two rebounds and one 3-pointer in 21 minutes.
        
        
             Nobody played more than 25 minutes for Boston, and Horford was content to stay in his lane offensively tonight -- he had a plus/minus rating of +27, and Kyrie Irving was on fire, so there was no need for him to be more involved. It's safe to say he'll be more active vs. Clint Capela and the Rockets on Saturday.

             Monroe picked up a DNP-CD on Monday, but coach Brad Stevens suggested that was just because other big men were playing well. ""We probably threw him to the wolves early [after acquiring him], and we'll continue to play him,"" Stevens said. ""We have great confidence in him."" Daniel Theis (hamstring) was out tonight and this turned into a rout in the second half, so there are many reasons to be skeptical. Leave Monroe on the wire.

             Irving and Kemba Walker had a terrific duel going, particularly in the first half when they combined for 45 points between them. It was all Kyrie and the Celtics after that, however, and the lopsided score prevented Irving from going supernova -- he played just 25 minutes, and even that tied Terry Rozier for a team-high. Next up is a showdown in Houston vs. the red-hot Rockets.

             Baynes scored 10 points in the first half alone and his physicality is a great tool for coach Brad Stevens, especially in matchups like this (vs. Dwight Howard). He's a combined 10-of-11 from the field since returning from his elbow injury, but doesn't typically do enough to be owned anywhere.

             The Thunder lucked out to get this win and they didn't get the Bestbrook version of their reigning MVP. Westbrook has also been a mess since the break and is wasting a ton of possessions, averaging a whopping 7.3 turnovers per game with his woeful 33.3 percent from the field on 16.5 attempts per game. OKC still went 3-1 in those game and they sit in the No. 7 spot in the air-tight Western Conference standings.

             He did suffer what looked to be a mild right elbow injury, but Adams looks to be OK. Adams was up to his usual tricks on the offensive glass with nine of them on that end to add to his lead in that category this season. He makes a bigger impact in reality, but his fantasy owners have to be pleased with his fifth-round value this season for nine-category leagues.

            The Hornets' five-game win streak ended in Boston on Wednesday, despite Kemba Walker's team-high 23 points on 9-of-13 shooting, five assists and four 3-pointers.
        
        
             The loss is dispiriting for the Hornets' playoff hopes, but Walker's owners won't complain. He's reeled off seven straight games with at least 50% shooting from downtown, and could have had a much bigger line if Boston didn't run away in the third quarter. Kemba wound up playing just 25 minutes, so at least he'll be rested to face the Sixers on Friday.

             Michael Kidd-Gilchrist (left hamstring) was out tonight, and coach Steve Clifford presumably didn't want to meddle with the chemistry of his second unit by starting Jeremy Lamb (10 points in 25 minutes). Graham could be a cheap deep-league source of steals and 3-pointers until MKG returns, but most owners should leave him untouched.

             The 14th-year veteran deserves plenty of credit for keeping Charlotte in the playoff hunt. He's yet to miss a game, ranks fourth in double-doubles (38), and has made life difficult for opposing centers. The rebounds were the lowest for Howard in a game he didn't leave early this season, so we'll keep an eye out for any indication that it was injury-related. He should be fine for a showdown vs. Joel Embiid and the Sixers on Friday.

             He made 10-of-13 from the field and hit a shot at the rim at the buzzer to send this game to overtime. One small bit of bad news is Powell made just 1-of-6 from the line in this home loss. That aside, he continues to see big minutes and played 33 on Monday, and it doesn't look like Nerlens Noel will be affecting his playing time.

            Stanley Johnson shifted to the Pistons' bench on Wednesday, where he had 19 points, six rebounds, four assists and one steal, making 6-of-11 FGs and 6-of-6 FTs in 30 minutes.
        
        
             James Ennis took over in the starting lineup but flopped with just four points and four fouls in 15 minutes. Despite tonight's solid line, Johnson's offense is very much a work in progress. That's likely part of the reason for his benching, and it makes tonight's efficient line even more surprising. We'll need to see him reproduce this a few times before buying.

             His first stint was really bad with three turnovers in five minutes, but he looked OK after that. It looks like the Mavs will be giving Noel some minutes going forward, but he'll have a tough time unseating Dwight Powell and Dirk Nowitzki to get to over 20 minutes. He's a mysterious flier in deeper leagues for now.

             The learning curve in Detroit has been steeper than Griffin's fantasy owners bargained for, at least through 11 games. He came in averaging 19.3 points on 40.1% shooting, 6.6 rebounds and 0.5 steals, which are all below than his numbers with the Clippers. ""I haven't been able to get us into a flow where we're getting good ball movement and getting Blake opportunities,"" said Stan Van Gundy. ""He's a focal-point guy and has to be."" It's good to know that SVG wants to better exploit Blake's skills, and he did get the ball in spots to create plays tonight, but the clock is ticking with only 21 regular-season games remaining.

             Two words are sufficient to explain Moreland's outburst tonight -- garbage time. The scoring, rebounds and assists were all career-highs, and five of Moreland's dimes came with the game already decided in the fourth quarter. This is worth remembering, but shouldn't prompt anyone to pick him up.

             Score one for the hometown narrative street crew. Durant got off to a hot start today with 16 points in the first to move him past Mitch Richmond for 40th on the all-time scoring list. His February has been his best full month as a Warrior for points per game with 27.6 and he did so on an absurd 74.9 TS%. He's arguably the best scorer ever.

             Middleton's overall line wasn't great and he shot 3-of-10 from the field, but he helped category-based owners with a 10-of-10 mark at the FT line. He's moved into the top-15 for weighted FT% this season, which is an underrated part of his fantasy appeal.

Henson is easily the best of the bunch for fantasy purposes, but top-100 value might be out of reach while Maker and Zeller are both in the mix.

             The Hampton Five lineup was big in this game and coach Steve Kerr seems to be going to it more these days. That could be due to the playoffs approaching or because he's not as confident in his centers right now.

             He had X-rays on his sore right elbow today and wasn't a lock to play, but obviously he was more than fine. Porter continues to be the guy that has seen a huge usage boost to help offset the loss of John Wall and it hasn't really hurt his efficiency either.

It looks like his minute-limit remains in place (he maxed out at 27 minutes on Tuesday), but at least owners won't have to be quite as concerned about DNPs down the stretch. Milwaukee has two back-to-back sets left on the schedule -- Mar. 4-5 and Mar. 29-30.

            An MRI revealed no structural damage in Pau Gasol's bruised left knee.
        
        
             Gasol is dealing with a bone bruise, so although the MRI was negative, it's still unclear when he'll be cleared to return. Joffrey Lauvergne and Davis Bertans could be very busy vs. the Lakers on Saturday, especially if LaMarcus Aldridge (ankle) can't suit up. We should have multiple updates in the next few days.

             It was a game to forget for the All-Star with his first make from the field not coming until 5:19 left in the third quarter. Beal's scoring hasn't really gone up since John Wall went down, but the big difference has been his seven dimes per game since Jan. 30. He'll be a difference maker in fantasy the rest of the way.

             Anunoby was diagnosed with a sprain -- X-rays were negative and we'll consider him questionable for Friday's game in D.C. Powell could get a boost if Anunoby can't suit up, but tonight's line should scare away all but the most optimistic owners. Pascal Siakam, C.J. Miles, Fred VanVleet and Jakob Poeltl are all currently more attractive options in Toronto's thriving bench unit.

             He said he had blurred vision that continued after the game when he looked down, but he said he hopes he can sleep it off. Giannis' right eye appears to be the worst of the two, but for now it sounds like he's OK. He finished with just 11 points, three rebounds and two assists against the Pistons.

             He continues to produce in the counting stats, but Oubre has had a handful of duds for FG%. That pretty much sums up his February, averaging 11.1 points, 4.0 boards, 1.3 assists, 1.1 steals and 1.4 treys in his previous games this month. He should still be worth owning in most leagues, especially if you're punting FG%.

             Ibaka was red-hot over his previous five games, averaging 16.2 points (60.4% FGs, 100.0% FTs), 1.4 triples, 8.0 rebounds and 1.6 blocks. That pace was unsustainable, but owners still have to be encouraged. ""[Ibaka] is stepping into his shot,"" said coach Dwane Casey. ""He’s [also] doing a better job getting into the paint, making plays and spraying it out and finding people when they do run him off [the 3-point line]. That’s the next evolution of his game."" Toronto has a nice rest-of-season schedule, with the exception of a two-game Week 24, and Ibaka is heating up at just the right time.

             VanVleet was reasonably efficient with 4-of-9 shooting, including three 3-pointers. He's been terrific on a per-minute basis this season and has quietly emerged as a reliable option in 8-cat and 9-cat leagues over the past month, but he's not as appealing in points-leagues due to modest counting stats.

             Coach Mike Budenholzer praised Prince for handling a larger workload and he was productive yet again today. Prince is going to have a very long leash now that not many Hawks can fill his minutes, so he'll have a big opportunity to produce on the stat sheet. Although, he's going to have some FG% issues.

             He was easily the best player in the first quarter and that strong start helps explain this beast of a stat line.

             The Clippers need some depth at forward, so Johnson will likely play both forward spots off the bench.

            Mario Hezonja sank 5-of-7 field goals and 4-of-5 free throws on Wednesday, scoring 17 points with three 3-pointers, two rebounds, two steals and one assist in 19 minutes.
        
        
             Hezonja averaged 26.0 minutes in the first two games after the break, despite the return of Aaron Gordon and Nikola Vucevic, but that's fallen to 17.0 in Orlando's past two games. Jonathan Isaac (ankle) could also return to action in Orlando on Friday, and Hezonja's owners should be alert to how his eventual return impacts the rotation.

Williams has a couple bright spots this year, but there's no need to add him unless he shows up tonight.

             Biyombo appeared to hurt his neck in the third quarter, but he stayed in the game and we're leaving him off the injury report.

             He was the fourth point guard to enter the game with the Hawks going with a weird rotation at guard. Delaney is probably going to get a start at some point this season, but there's little reason to stash him while Dennis Schroder is active.

             The steals continue to be a huge story for Oladipo and he now has at least one in 44 straight to tie him for the 17th-best streak in NBA history (Jimmy Butler). His six steals today give him a slight edge for the NBA lead in steals per game and he'll likely hold it unless Paul George gets at least three steals tonight. Bad loss aside for the Pacers, Oladipo's fantasy owners got themselves a winning player on the stat sheet tonight.

             Gordon was on the injury report as 'questionable' prior to tip-off, but that appears to have been a simple precaution. There's no reason to think his status is in imminent danger, but bumps and bruises could give Orlando enough pretense to rest him as they tank down the stretch. In the meantime, Gordon's owners just want him to make some shots -- he's made at least half of his field goal attempts just once since Dec. 30.

The Pacers have used him as a stretch four a lot this season, but that may be less likely now that they can use Trevor Booker in that role.

His owners shouldn't be too concerned and keep starting him like they normally would until further notice.

             He played in the fourth as the Pacers tried to make a comeback attempt, which took minutes away from Myles Turner. Now that the Pacers have a decent backup power forward coming in Trevor Booker, coach Nate McMillan may be less inclined to play his two-center lineups. Sabonis should still be an OK hold going forward.

             Just when it looked like he had it going after a 24-point Monday, Turner falls off a cliff. He was in foul trouble and the Pacers played from behind, so coach Nate McMillan went away from his starting center. Hopefully, the addition of Trevor Booker doesn't impact Turner negatively because Turner does play next to Domantas Sabonis at times. Either way, Turner's owners shouldn't be too concerned compared to previous instances.

             The Spurs are running out of bodies here and Lauvergne was really the only choice. We should see a lot of Rudy Gay and Kyle Anderson at the four to help fill the void while Davis Bertans is going to have to play more too. Aldridge's ankle injury didn't look too bad, so Lauvergne is only a speculative add in deep leagues.

            LaMarcus Aldridge (ankle) will not return against the Pelicans on Wednesday.
        
        
             The Spurs rule him out fairly quickly after he went to the locker room about 10 minutes prior to this announcement. His ankle injury didn't look too bad, but the Spurs tend to be careful when it involves injuries. It should be Joffrey Lauvergne getting the nod in the second half while Rudy Gay would also have to help out off the bench. There will be a lot of shots to go around, too. Aldridge finished with eight points, three rebounds and one foul in 13 minutes.

             Gallinari is dealing with a ""contusion/sprain"" and although X-rays came back negative, it's unclear when he might be cleared to return. He's been a notoriously slow healer during his NBA career, but we'll continue to list him as day-to-day. Wes Johnson should gain the most if Gallo isn't ready to play vs. the Knicks on Friday.

             Ilyasova recently secured a buyout from the rebuilding Hawks, clearing him to join the playoff-hungry Sixers. In order to clear a roster spot, Philly waived Trevor Booker. It's a solid real-world addition for the Sixers' frontcourt, but Ilyasova is a dubious fantasy asset while Dario Saric is healthy.

The good news is there was no need for him to get back out there since it was garbage time, and hopefully the Bucks give a positive update after the game.

             Anunoby is not going to return to this game after rolling his ankle for the second time this month. Powell should slot right into OG's minutes, but he won't be getting enough shots next to the other first-unit guys.

             X-rays were negative but the Raptors ruled him out before the second half. Norman Powell started the second half because coach Dwane Casey likes to keep his second unit together. It's worth a mention he did have a right ankle injury earlier this month, too. There's not much fantasy impact from this news, although Pascal Siakam could emerge if he's going to miss much time. Hopefully OG is OK for the weekend.

             Ben McLemore will start alongside Andrew Harrison, Dillon Brooks, JaMychal Green and Marc Gasol. They're facing a smaller Suns team and this might simply be a matchup-based decision, but bringing Martin off the bench also helps compensate for the absence of Deyonta Davis (ankle). Either way, most owners can just leave Martin on the wire.

             It's a tank game and the Grizzlies will be using McLemore despite how he hasn't played well. This move is also probably because the Grizzlies are a little thinner up front with Deyonta Davis out, so Jarell Martin will play all power forward. Leave McLemore on the wire.

The Thunder could use another wing because they've been leaning on Terrance Ferguson, Josh Huestis and Alex Abrines a lot more than expected. Brewer has almost no fantasy value, though.

This should also help Marquese Chriss because the Suns won't be going with small-ball fours as much. Also, the Suns are now calling it a ischial tuberosity contusion, which is slightly different from the tailbone location from earlier today.

            Nerlens Noel will play against the Thunder on Wednesday, but coach Rick Carlisle isn’t sure how much.
        
        
             ""I know this: He’s got fresh legs,"" Carlisle said. He's been out since November and chances are the Mavs won't be unleashing him. Most fantasy owners will want to take a wait-and-see approach on Noel, especially with how the team has kept him on the bench for so long.

             T.J. Warren (tailbone) is unlikely to play tonight, so barring an unexpected change in Warren's status, Jackson will serve as his replacement. As a starter at the forward position this season, Jackson owns averages of 13.6 points, 3.3 boards, 1.1 triples, 1.0 steal, 0.9 swats and 1.3 turnovers per game on 42.4% shooting, so he's on the DFS radar tonight.

             The Grizzlies and Suns will put their 10-game ""losing"" streaks on the line tonight, so it makes sense to sit Warren on the road. Jackson should have a big opportunity in front of him today and he'll be a popular DFS play. Consider Warren day-to-day for now.

It'll be interesting to see how Delaney fits back into the rotation with how well Isaiah Taylor has played over the past three, but Budenholzer suggesting that Taylor and Dennis Schroder will share the floor suggests that Delaney's return won't have a huge impact on Taylor's minutes.

            Michael Kidd-Gilchrist (left hamstring) and Cody Zeller (knee) will not play against the Celtics on Wednesday.
        
        
             MKG pulled his hamstring on Tuesday and he did not return. He hasn't had a history of left hamstring injuries, but the Hornets will likely be careful with him based on how easy it is to aggravate that muscle injury. With him out, it'll be Treveon Graham in the first unit, but Jeremy Lamb will be benefitting the most off the bench.

             The Bucks will just move Brown up to keep Jabari Parker in the second unit. Brown has been playing minutes in the upper teens lately, but he hasn't produced much with averages of 5.4 points, 4.2 boards and 1.0 treys in 18.0 minutes per game over his last five. He's only a desperation stream or a tourney DFS punt today.

Hart still needs to decide if he's going to have surgery, and it's possible he will miss the rest of the season. His minutes will be split among the guards and the Lakers could go bigger at the wings, too.

             ""I was hurting myself before,"" Chriss said. ""I wasn’t focused. I wasn’t mentally stable. I don’t think it’s anything that I need help with. It’s just something I had to re-evaluate myself and like I said be grateful for the position I’m in."" This is the second time in 2018 Chriss has talked about not being in the right head space and he's having a tougher time getting it going in his second season. Hopefully he can get it all figured out, but he's not really worth owning in most leagues.

Coach Erik Spoelstra has called Johnson a ""psycho"" for wanting to play at less than 100 percent, so there's a good chance he'll be out there. He may have more run going his way with Wayne Ellington (quad) doubtful to play.

             He suffered the injury on Tuesday night and did not return, and he didn't practice on Wednesday. Assuming Ellington is out, that should open up a few extra minutes for Dwyane Wade and chances are Rodney McGruder gets into the double digits for minutes. This also helps Kelly Olynyk as a floor-spacing shooter in the second unit. Ellington is a drop candidate with this news.

             He suffered the injury in practice today and it sounds like he is going to miss time here. Hart was still able to flirt with 30 minutes per game even with Lonzo Ball back, and the Lakers showed their confidence in him when they bought out Corey Brewer. If Hart is indeed out, that could mean the Lakers go with bigger lineups, or they could give minutes to Tyler Ennis or Alex Caruso. Hart's fantasy owners will probably have to drop him, but they may want to wait for the word on his treatment plan.

            Once he clears waivers, Trevor Booker will sign a minimum deal with the Pacers for the remainder of the season, according to Shams Charania of Yahoo! Sports.
        
        
             Well, that didn't take long and Booker should be able to clear waivers. The Pacers have basically played without a backup power forward in their rotation now with some two-center lineups and small-ball groups helping fill out minutes behind Thaddeus Young. Booker could see minutes in the teens once he gets his feet wet, but he likely won't have much fantasy value while the Pacers are healthy up front.

             It sounds like he's back after he missed Monday's game due to illness. His return means Tarik Black moves back to the bench and the Rockets would be less likely to play Luc Mbah a Moute at the five. Capela should be starting in all leagues tonight.

             This move has been expected for a few days since the 76ers were linked to Ilyasova. Booker is still likely to be pursued by teams once he clears waivers, but chances are he would likely be put into a reserve role.

             It looks like Parker could be playing in his first back-to-back set of the season today, which would be very encouraging for his rest-of-season outlook. His minutes have been steadily rising, and he's scored in double figures in his previous two outings, so it'll be interesting to see what he can do tonight. He tore the ACL in his left knee twice over a three-year span, so his play this season has really been nothing short of incredible.

Davis Bertans could be in line for a start sans Pau, and Joffrey Lauvergne should also see an uptick in minutes.RotoGrinders.com Daily Slant: LaMarcus Aldridge is a top option in all formats, as his salary is a shade or two below where it should be sans Gasol - with Pau and all other non-rotation members on the floor this year, LMA leads the Spurs in fantasy point per minute (FPPM) differential at +0.11. Dejounte Murray, who owns a +2.0% usage bump with Gasol/Leonard off the floor, is another fine target on the SA side with some very real upside at his middling price tag.

             It sounds like the days of Ball dealing with minutes restrictions are just about numbered, and with the Lakers not having another back-to-back set until mid-March, that likely won't be an issue anymore either. As long as he can stay healthy, Ball could realistically flirt with top 30 value over the final few months of the season.

             Zeller exited Tuesday's game after experiencing some swelling in his knee, and with this being the second night of a back-to-back set, the Hornets may want to take a cautious approach given this is the same knee that was surgically repaired earlier in the year. If Zeller sits, Frank Kaminsky would likely pick up most of his minutes, and Willy Hernangomez could also have a more meaningful role in the rotation.

             MKG tweaked his hamstring on Tuesday, so it wouldn't be surprising at all to see him sit this one out with very little recovery time in between games. Zeller had some swelling in his knee after Tuesday's game, so he's likely headed for a game-time call. If both these guys are out, there will be more minutes available for Jeremy Lamb, Frank Kaminsky and Willy Hernangomez. Stay tuned.

             Paul Millsap (wrist) returned from a 44-game absence tonight, and the Nuggets needed Mason Plumlee for his size against Los Angeles' frontcourt. There will likely be matchups when Lyles gets the nod over Plumlee, but with Millsap active again, you can't trust him outside of deeper formats.

             This comes on the heels of a 15-point outing vs. the Suns in which he played 37 minutes with eight rebounds, four assists, one block and a triple. Wallace is getting a lot of run right now with Danilo Gallinari (hand) on the shelf, and with his status in doubt for Wednesday's contest vs. Houston, Wallace could be in line for another large workload which puts him in the streaming conversation.

             He played a team-high 36 minutes, adding six assists, five rebounds, two steals, one block and one triple. Williams has crushed his ADP with top-30 value in standard 9-category leagues on the season and the Clippers have a great fantasy playoff schedule (3-4-4-4 over next four weeks), so his owners should be in great shape.

             The Clippers were down 82-63 when Boban entered the game with 4:06 left in the third quarter, but the rest is history. The Clippers went to Boban over and over again and the Nuggets didn't have a prayer, as he hit 5-of-8 shots and 8-of-9 free throws while finishing with an absurd +/- rating of +27 in 15 minutes. We're not sure if coach Doc Rivers can justify keeping him out of the rotation following this outburst, so watch this closely the next couple games.

We've seen Napier get hot at times this season, but it usually doesn't happen when CJM and Lillard are both healthy. He simply got hot tonight and did a lot of damage when the Blazers were putting the Kings away late. He played the same number of minutes on Saturday (21) and went 0-for-10 without scoring a point, and hadn't had a 20-point game since Jan. 9. He still belongs on waivers.

             He's been really good in his four games since a meltdown on Feb. 11, when he failed to score and had three rebounds and a block in 14 minutes. He's played between 25-30 minutes in his last four games, averaging 15.8 points, 10.5 rebounds, 2.3 assists, 1.0 steals and 1.5 blocks during that stretch. It's probably not a coincidence that the Blazers have won those four games, and while he's probably got another dud or two in his future this season, he's a must-own, must-start player, obviously.

             Aminu keeps bouncing on and off the waiver wire in fantasy leagues because of his inconsistency, and he just can't seem to put it all together for long stretches. He's scored 13, 5, 12, 9 and 8 points in each of his last five games and only has four double-doubles on the season. He has hit a 3-pointer in 14 straight games, but he's also scored in single digits in nine of those, which is why he's not owned in more leagues.

             That was disappointing after Hield had scored between 12 and 29 points in his previous five games, including a 29-point line on Feb. 16 and a 21-point outing on Saturday. The minutes were there and he simply couldn't make a shot, so just hold onto him if you own him. He'll bounce back against the Nets on Thursday.

             Skal had 20 points on Monday and looked ready to take off, but the Kings refuse to give him the starting job in a lost season and continue to roll Z-Bo out there on a semi-regular basis. Skal's minutes should start trending up and Randolph's should be trending down soon, but for now, it's a guessing game as to when Randolph will play or sit. And so far, Labissiere takes a big hit when Randolph is in the starting lineup. It's going to be a rough ride for both players until the Kings finally make a decision.

             Welp, that caused Skal Labissiere to be limited to 20 minutes (and a quiet night), while Randolph continues to play well, when he actually plays. He's likely to get random DNPs the rest of the way and we're still not sure why the Kings don't just give the starting job to Skal and let him develop the rest of the way in a lost season. But if you want to hold Randolph and use him when he's starting, he should perform on those days. He's been in street clothes in two of his last five games though, so trying to figure out when he's going to play will probably not be easy.

             He'll be sore in the morning, but it's nice to know that Wade has still got it. He hit a step-back jumper over Ben Simmons with 5.9 seconds left to seal the win for Miami, hitting 10-of-16 shots and 5-of-5 free throws with one rebound, one assist, one block, three steals and two triples. As clutch as he was, we're not going to overreact here as he averaged just 8.6 points, 5.0 rebounds and 3.0 assists in his previous five games. Wayne Ellington did tweak his hamstring, so maybe Wade picks up a handful of minutes.

             He wasn't expected to play ""big minutes"" tonight, but he looked solid at both ends and coach Erik Spoelstra probably didn't want to take him out. He finished 2-of-6 from the field and 4-of-5 from the line in 25 minutes, while James Johnson and Bam Adebayo played a combined 23 minutes. The frontcourt rotation is very crowded, but Olynyk could carve out standard-league value if he sees minutes in the mid-to-high 20s.

             Kelly Olynyk (shoulder) made his return tonight and immediately played 25 minutes, while Hassan Whiteside had it going with 15 points, 11 rebounds, three assists, three steals and three blocks in 34 minutes. There will be nights when coach Erik Spoelstra calls Adebayo's name more than usual, but now that Miami is healthy up front, he's just a deep-league asset.

             Nance was in some foul trouble on Sunday when he played just 15 minutes, but then again, he has exactly four fouls in four straight games. He also likely picked up a few extra minutes with Jeff Green (lower back soreness) out tonight. Despite some early inconsistency with his new team, he's still worth owning with Kevin Love and others hurting for the Cavs.

             He probably wasn't going to see the floor, but a Wayne Ellington (hamstring) injury changed things. McGruder may get a handful of minutes here and there, but he's not a fantasy pickup and is more of an energy guy off the bench for Miami.

             Justise Winslow wasn't much better in his 19 minutes, but this is bad timing because Kelly Olynyk (shoulder) and Rodney McGruder (leg) both returned from their injuries tonight. Johnson has been more of a liability than an asset this season, so he's on the chopping block if there's a hot free agent on the wire. Expect Johnson's role to be volatile going forward.

             Parker had 18 points, six boards and two 3-pointers on Sunday, and is starting to come on for the Bucks. He's only played in nine games this season, but has made it through five straight and has looked pretty good in his last four. The Bucks still have 22 regular-season games on the schedule with just two sets of back-to-backs remaining, so if all goes well, it's possible Parker will play in 19 or so. And if he keeps playing like he has over the last week, he can help fantasy owners in the playoffs, when the Bucks have a pretty attractive schedule, going four games in both Week 23 and 24.

             The good news is that he played 32 minutes, as his defense is keeping him on the floor --  he ranks third among small forwards in Real Plus-Minus rating. Covington added four rebounds, two assists, three steals and a triple, but despite the fact that he's tanking his fantasy owners field goal percentage, he's still getting the job done in points, steals, rebounds and triples with a handful of blocks and dimes.

             It's hard to believe the Bucks didn't win this one behind Giannis' line alone, but the Wizards used a balanced approach to offset big nights from Giannis, Khris Middleton, Eric Bledsoe and Jabari Parker to get the win. Giannis' line wasn't quite as great as Anthony Davis' on Monday night, but it was a fantasy monstrosity and he easily set a season high in blocks, beating his old number by two of them. The Greek Freak might be the most appropriate nickname in the league.

             Beal led his team in points, rebounds, assists and field goals made tonight and should continue to excel as long as John Wall is out for the Wizards. The Wizards' box score was light tonight, but it didn't stop them from beating Giannis Antetokounmpo and the Bucks in Milwaukee.

             The Wizards' box score is one of the most plain-looking, boring ones you'll ever see as 10 Wizards scored between 21 and four points, and no one had more than seven rebounds or eight assists. Sato finished with four fouls, which is why his minutes (and production) weren't all that great tonight. Don't worry, as Tim Frazier only had eight points and three assists, meaning Sato should be ready to bounce back on Wednesday night against the Warriors.

             He played the entire four quarter and it's a good thing he did, as he scored 11 of his 14 points in it. Hood has been alternating mediocre games with bad ones, and hasn't been fun to own, especially since being traded to the Cavs. The minutes have been creeping up though, and he might be ready to start putting up more consistent (and better) numbers going forward. The 31 minutes are the most he's played in a Cavs uniform.

             The second-year forward played a team-high 36 minutes, adding seven rebounds, two assists, one steal and three triples. Saric has now scored in double digits in 40 straight games and has been one of Philly's most consistent players this season, but he could lose a bit of playing time when the 76ers acquire Ersan Ilyasova. The 76ers have also been using Richaun Holmes next to Joel Embiid a bit. Saric is still a must-own player and could still hold onto top-75 value the way he's been playing.

             Hill's been a rocky ride in Cleveland, struggling with his shot, struggling with assists, and struggling in general, so tonight's game came out of nowhere. In fact, he had two points and one assist on 1-of-7 shooting on Sunday against the Spurs, which was his previous game. In his six game in Cleveland, he's score seven or fewer points in three of them, and hit double figures in the other three. He's not the most exciting player to own, but If he was dumped in your league, he still deserves to be picked up.

             He finished 2-of-3 from the field and 2-of-2 from the line with a +/- rating of +9 in the one-point loss. He played next to Joel Embiid a bit tonight and that combo has had a lot of success this season with a 23.2 net rating. Unfortunately, the frontcourt rotation is going to get even messier when the 76ers add Ersan Ilyasova this week. If Holmes can somehow carve out a consistent role, he'd obviously be very intriguing.

            LeBron James hit 13-of-25 shots and two 3-pointers for 31 points, 12 rebounds, 11 assists and a steal, and had just one turnover on a historic night in a 129-123 win over the Nets.
        
        
             LeBron became the first NBA player in history with a career of 30,000 points, 8,000 rebounds and 8,000 assists tonight and was showered with MVP chants. He also became the oldest player (33) to ever average a triple-double in a month, as Wilt Chamberlain was 31 when he did it back in the day. LeBron came into this one averaging 26.6 points, 10.3 rebounds and 10.4 assists for the month of February, and all those numbers went up tonight. And maybe the most interesting stat is that he only had four actual triple-doubles out of his 11 games this month.

             He'll need a lot more minutes than that to consistently perform, but the good news is that he's played in back-to-back games, is over his knee injury, and looks pretty good. He's still not a must-own player with the Nets having so many options at the wings, but he's worth keeping a close eye on.

             The Nets have 20 wins and have no shot at the playoffs, yet vets like DeMarre Carroll (16 points, six boards, three 3-pointers) and injury risks like Russell, who missed 32 straight games due to left knee surgery, keep starting and playing big minutes for them. You have to think that will change at some point, but Kenny Atkinson hasn't shown any signs that he'll be shutting his more experienced players down any time soon. The Nets really wanted to beat the Cavs tonight and Russell came through with 11 points in the fourth quarter.

             Allen had 18 points, nine boards and three blocks last night, but didn't fare as well against LeBron James and company tonight. But the minutes are there, the talent in there, and this is Brooklyn's chance to develop him. As frustrating as it's been all season, you pretty much have no choice but to stick with him.

             Michael Kidd-Gilchrist went down with a hamstring injury and could miss time, and while Lamb's officially the next man up, the Hornets will likely start Dwayne Bacon or Treveon Graham to keep the rotation intact. If MKG's going to miss an extended period of time, Lamb will be worth owning in 12-team leagues, but Bacon and Graham aren't likely to be worth owning.

             Michael Kidd-Gilchrist left this one with a hamstring injury and could miss time, so Batum will have to be more aggressive and step up a little more on both ends of the court if that's the case. And Batum was already hot coming into this one and is averaging 11.4 points, 5.6 rebounds, 8.6 assists, 1.8 steals, 0.6 blocks and 2.4 3-pointers over his last five, despite shooting just 43 percent.

His status for Wednesday's game vs. Boston is up in the air, but we'll see more of Frank Kaminsky if Zeller can't go.

             The Hornets are fighting for their playoff lives so it's all hands on deck. However, they're currently in 10th place in the East and if they fall more than five games out of the hunt, we could see them throw in the towel and start resting guys. There's a chance Walker will finish out the season either way, but if you own him, it makes sense to root for the Hornets to keep winning games.

             Howard was a little iffy to come back for the second half, but looked OK on the court. The best news for Howard's owners is that Charlotte is still hanging in the race, sitting 3.5 games behind the No. 8 Heat as of this second. But once (or 'if') the Hornets fall too far behind, Howard will be a candidate to be shut down given the fact he's one of the elder statesmen in the league at this point. Watch for news on Howard's sore ribs prior to Wednesday night's game against the Celtics.

He should be good to go until the end of the season for a team not going anywhere.

            David Nwaba hit 4-of-5 shots, 1-of-1 3-pointers and 2-of-2 free throws for 11 points, six rebounds, two assists, three steals and a block in 32 minutes of Tuesday's loss to the Hornets.
        
        
             He picked up five fouls, so it was nice to see him get so many minutes. It looks like Nwaba is locked and loaded for the rest of the way for the tanking Bulls, and he's been getting it done, averaging 12 points, 7.2 boards, 1.2 assists, 1.2 steals, 0.6 blocks and 1.0 3-pointers on 64 percent shooting over his last five games. He's very close to becoming a must-own player.

             LaVine's been great since returning from his knee injury, but owners have to be a little worried that he could be shut down at some point for the tanking Bulls. For now, he only appears to be in jeopardy of missing half of back-to-backs, but given the severity of the injury he's come back from, he's not a lock to still be playing in April.

            Kris Dunn hit just 2-of-11 shots, missed all three of his 3-pointers, committed seven turnovers and also picked up four fouls in Tuesday's disaster against Kemba Walker and the Hornets.
        
        
             Dunn did hit 6-of-8 free throws to finish with 10 points, two rebounds and three assists, but in addition to all the bad stuff listed above, he also failed to record a steal tonight. He had a completely different game on Monday night, when he went off for his best game since returning from his concussion, but had trouble doing much right tonight. Hopefully he'll have better luck against the Mavericks on Friday.

             He played pretty well against Dwight Howard, although some blocks would have been nice. Felicio is an interesting fantasy player right now with Robin Lopez out of the loop, but the fact remains he's averaging just 7.2 points, 3.0 rebounds and 0.6 blocks over his last five games, meaning he hasn't been worth owning.

             He suffered the injury in the second quarter, finishing with two points and one rebound in 11 minutes. He was averaging 2.6 triples in February prior to Tuesday and was still getting solid minutes with Dwyane Wade in town, but his fantasy owners may need to move on if he misses additional time. The Heat will use a committee approach to soak up his minutes.

             That's not good. This is the same knee he had surgery on earlier this season, so the Hornets aren't going to take any chances. He finished with two points, four rebounds and one assist in 11 minutes. If he misses time, Frank Kaminsky will step up and we might even see more of Willy Hernangomez.

Check back for an update on Wednesday morning after the Rockets have their shootaround.

             Available to play doesn't necessarily mean that he'll actually get out there, and there have been rumors that he could receive a buyout from Philly once they sign Ersan Ilyasova on Wednesday. Either way, Booker is safe to leave on waivers in all leagues.

             This will be the third straight game on the sideline for Evans. An MRI on his ribcage revealed slight cartilage damage. However, the team is considering him day-to-day, and they are ""not expecting it to be a long absence,"" according to coach J.B. Bickerstaff. Still, the Grizz have no real incentive to rush back one of their best players, as they will be focused on draft lottery positioning over the next six weeks. Andrew Harrison is the primary beneficiary with Evans on the sidelines.

             McGruder has been inactive all season after he underwent surgery to repair a stress fracture in his left tibia back in October. Coach Spo will only play him limited minutes once as he works his way back into game shape. However, even once he's fully healthy, McGruder likely won't see regular minutes in the Heat rotation. He should be left on waivers.

             Gordon was seen icing his left hip after Monday's loss to OKC, which is the same hip that recently forced him to spend nine straight games on the sidelines. There's not much incentive for Gordon to play hurt with Orlando chasing Ping-Pong balls, so don't be surprised if he skips Wednesday's game. We'll have another update following shootaround, but if he is forced to sit, that would likely result in Mario Hezonja returning to the starting five.

            Pau Gasol (left knee bone bruise) is doubtful to play Wednesday against the Pelicans.
        
        
             Gasol hurt his knee during Sunday's game, and while he initially said it was ""nothing serious,"" a bone bruise can result in a multi-game absence depending on the severity. It wouldn't be surprising at all to see the 37-year-old hit the sidelines tomorrow, which would result in more minutes for Davis Bertans and Joffrey Lauvergne. Check back for another update following Wednesday morning's shootaround.

Cory Joseph and Joe Young will continue to man the point guard spot in his absence, with Lance Stephenson seeing some increased ball handling opportunities with the second unit. Collison should be back soon enough, so owners should just stick with him.

             Gallinari initially suffered the hand injury Thursday night in a loss to the Warriors. The X-rays came back negative, but Gallo was unable to play Friday. And, despite three days of rest, he won't suit up Tuesday night either. Tyrone Wallace will likely draw another start. Wallace started on Friday and finished with 15 points, eight rebounds and four assists in 37 minutes. He'll be a popular DFS target on Tuesday due to his affordable price tag.RotoGrinders.com Daily Slant: In Gallo's absence against the Suns on Friday, Lou Williams lead the Clippers in usage at a 35.5% clip, while Tobias Harris, Austin Rivers and Wallace all got at least ten shot attempts up. Wallace is a very solid dollar per point target industry wide, while Rivers and Harris are both enticing mid-range targets. DeAndre Jordan is also squarely on the DFS radar. Williams is a top option in all formats.

             Noel has not played since November 22nd. Thus, he will see only limited minutes as he works his way back into game shape. In addition, Noel was averaging just 12.5 minutes per contest over the 18 games he appeared in earlier this season, prior to his injury. Nonetheless, he has some upside, and the Mavs will tanking over the final six months of the season, so Noel may be worth a flier if you have roster space in a deep league.

However, ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski reported on Monday that Leonard is hoping to return to the lineup ""sometime in March."" It's a positive sign that Kawhi is back working in unison with the Spurs medical staff, but we still don't have a reliable timetable for his return to action.

             Millsap has a chance to play in his first game since November 19th. However, even if Millsap is active, it's safe to assume that coach Mike Malone will limit his minutes over his first handful of games back in action. Millsap's return will likely bump Will Barton back to the bench, and will reduce Trey Lyles playing time. The Nuggets tip off at 10:30 est tonight, so we can expect an update on Millsap's status at approximately 9:00 pm, when coach Malone addresses the media pregame.

             McGruder has yet to appear in a game for the Heat this season after undergoing surgery to repair a stress fracture in his left tibia back in mid-October. However, he's been making solid progress and is inching closer to a return. He had 16 points (on 8-of-17 shooting), five rebounds, one assist and no turnovers in 20 minutes on Saturday for the Sioux Falls Skyforce. He will likely be active for Miami shortly, but he should be left on waivers in all fantasy formats, as it is unlikely he'll see consistent minutes with the Heat.

            Kelly Olynyk (shoulder) participated in shootaround and appears to be on track to play Tuesday night vs. the Sixers.
        
        
             Olynyk was able to practice fully on Monday, but admitted that his shoulder still wasn't 100 percent. After Tuesday's shootaround, Heat beat writer Anthony Chiang tweeted that Olynyk ""is going to approach tonight like he's going to play some minutes vs. 76ers. Won't play big minutes, if he plays."" We can expect confirmation on Olynyk's status later this evening, prior to tip-off.

However, he is averaging 10.6 points on 9.0 field goal attempts per game with the Cavs. ""We definitely have to get him more touches,"" Lue said of Hood. ""We have to make sure we have a balance of getting the ball in his hands and getting the ball in Jordan [Clarkson]'s hands with that second unit and letting those guys be aggressive. Also at times when he has the ball he has to be aggressive. I think right now he's in between, not sure. But we need him to be aggressive and score the basketball.""

He's going to get minutes going forward with Jimmy Butler out until further notice, but he's not really all that reliable and only contributes in points, threes and a few assists, that is when his shot is falling.

             Teague has been shooting it well and playing at a high level recently, and saved his night at the free throw line in this one.

             He hasn't missed a game this season and is rolling, but the Wolves only have 18 games left, while a team like the Sixers has 22 games left. If you want to take a look at the schedule and try to trade KAT for a couple studs with more games, it might make sense. But at least you know KAT's going to play this thing out for Tom Thibodeau, and the minutes are going to be big, as Thibs just doesn't use his bench.

             Zach Randolph was rested, so there was plenty of touches up for grabs. Labissiere looks healthy again after struggling with a shoulder injury before the break and the Kings are planning to play their young talent more, so this is a good time to take a flier on Labissiere, especially with four more games this week.

             Jimmy Butler's out for several weeks and Bjelica is starting in his place. He was good tonight, and also has the ability to block some shots. Another thing working in his favor is that Tom Thibodeau only played eight guys until the final two minutes of a game the Wolves were in control of, so Bjelica should be guaranteed heavy minutes until Butler is back. He should be a pretty hot pickup in fantasy leagues right now.

             The counting stats were nice in addition to the workload, but Crowder ruined it by hitting just 4-of-15 shots and 2-of-4 free throws. He has seen an uptick in value during his short time with the Jazz, but he's still more of a deep-league asset for the time being because he's really been just a 3-category player (points, rebounds and 3s).

February has been his best month with averages of 15.5 points, 4.2 assists, 3.7 rebounds, 1.1 steals and 3.1 triples prior to Monday, but those probably aren't realistic numbers when Ricky Rubio is healthy.

             The Rockets are 19-1 when Tucker makes at least two 3-pointers, but they were able to get the win tonight without Tucker or James Harden firing on all cylinders. You'd have to be in a pretty deep league to own Tucker.

Booker has become an offensive superstar this season, but coach Jay Triano said he'd like to see Booker focus a little more on the defensive side as well. ""When I first took over, I thought he was outstanding on the defensive end. Not good. Outstanding,"" Triano said. ""He bought into everything. I think the injuries, the length of the season, he’s drifted a bit and I’ve challenged him to be better now."" Booker said himself that he doesn't want to rest, so he's locked in for a big finish and we'll see if he's up to Triano's challenge.

Tyson Chandler (neck) is still out and coach Jay Triano said before the game that he's planning to play Len ""as much as possible,"" so his fantasy owners should probably give him a chance to bounce back.

             It may not matter if he's coming off the bench or starting, as he's averaging 16.8 points, 3.0 rebounds, 10.0 assists, 0.8 steals and 3.0 3-pointers over his last four games. Just keep rolling him out there until further notice.

             That's a nice line and he was happy to get his starting point guard job back after playing shooting guard for a couple games. Smith may hurt fantasy owners more than he helps him at times and his ranking is incredibly low on some ranking sites, but he should play out the rest of the season for the Mavs and might have gotten a wake-up call while playing behind J.J. Barea.

             The Pelicans rewarded him with a contract for the remainder of the season on Monday and Okafor responded with arguably his best game of the campaign. He was averaging 3.7 points, 6.3 rebounds and 2.0 blocks in 16.2 minutes per game prior to this little outburst, so we're still not adding him outside of deeper fantasy leagues.

             This is not how you tank and while Barnes was nice tonight, you have to wonder if the Mavs will continue to give him heavy minutes down the stretch. Just keep rolling him out there unless news breaks that he's going to start missing time. So far, that doesn't appear to be the case.

             He fell just short of his career-high of 59. Davis is the top player in standard fantasy leagues on the season and just pushed himself ahead even further with this monster of a game. He joins Bob McAdoo as the only players with 50 points, 15 rebounds and five blocks in a single game, and this was his third career game with 50+ points and 15+ rebounds -- the rest of the NBA has a combined three of those games in the last 17 years. Please stay healthy.

             Myles Turner was playing well and the Pacers went small against the centerless Mavs, but the fact that Sabonis has played 19 or fewer minutes in two of his last three games is a concern. But he had 21 points and 13 boards on Friday against the Hawks, so hopefully he'll bounce back on Wednesday, when the Pacers get the Hawks again.

             We say it all the time, but opposing centers punish the Mavericks and tonight was no exception, except that the Mavs actually beat the Pacers. Turner had just seven points and eight boards on Friday, and has been a very frustrating player to own in fantasy this season. But maybe tonight's line will get him going and he'll finish the season in a flurry. It's just too bad he doesn't face the Mavericks every night.

             February has been his worst month this season with averages of 17.1 points, 3.2 rebounds, 2.2 assists and 2.6 assists prior to Monday, so it's nice to see the Warriors focus on getting him going tonight. He added five assists, four rebounds, one steal and four triples, hitting all four of his free throws in 33 minutes. Despite a few quiet weeks, Thompson is still flirting with top-30 value in standard leagues with plenty of room to grow in the final six weeks.

             The fact the Thunder won this game with that game from Westbrook should tell you just how hard the Magic are tanking. Carmelo Anthony wasn't much better, hitting 4-of-15 shots for nine points and nine boards, but Paul George scored 26, Steven Adams played well, and the Thunder bench made a rare appearance in the win.

Green and his fantasy owners also received some good news on Monday afternoon, as the NBA rescinded the technical foul that he received against the Thunder -- this means he's back down to 14 on the season, two away from an automatic one-game suspension. The Warriors are planning to give his shoulder a day of rest soon anyways, so they may just wait until the 16th technical.

             This is a concern, as every Magic starter played at least 33 minutes tonight. Hezonja's minutes have declined in three straight games, which is when Aaron Gordon came back. Mario's fantasy value might not be dead in the water just yet, but if the minutes aren't there in the next one, owners will probably have to make a decision on whether to keep him or not.

He's a per-minute stud in fantasy and will be back on the standard-league radar if he can get his minutes around 20 like they were in December.

            Michael Beasley had a quiet night vs. the Warriors on Monday, scoring seven points with four rebounds, four assists and three turnovers.
        
        
             It just wasn't his night. Not only did he hit just 1-of-7 shots, he got hit himself and needed five stitches for a cut above his eye. He did return to the game, and this was just his second dud compared to five strong games since the Kristaps Porzingis knee injury. Beasley is a hold.

He's back, baby, and his strong play has to be making owners who held onto him for too long during his hip injury feel a little bit better.

             The rookie logged 28 minutes on the night, as the Knicks continue to find more minutes for their young talent -- Courtney Lee's role has been reduced and Ntilikina is playing off the ball a lot more to accommodate Trey Burke and Emmanuel Mudiay. Ntilikina added five rebounds, one assist and one triple, and while the bump in minutes has been nice, he's not ready to help standard-league owners on a consistent basis yet.

             He continued to stay hot from the field, hitting 8-of-15 shots and his only free throw of the night. Emmanuel Mudiay and Frank Ntilikina both played well tonight, but the good news is that all three players are getting plenty of minutes with New York using a lot more two-PG lineups. Burke is coming off two straight 26-point games with a combined 14 assists, and while he could cool off at any moment, he's currently too hot to leave on the wire.

             As expected, we saw a lot of two-PG lineups again with Frank Ntilikina (13-5-1 in 28 minutes) and Trey Burke (18-5-1 in 25 minutes) both getting plenty of burn. Mudiay isn't known for his efficiency and was hitting 39.7% of his shots prior to Monday, but he managed to hit 8-of-15 shots with zero turnovers. He's now averaging 11.7 points, 4.5 assists, 3.3 rebounds, 1.2 steals, 0.5 triples and 2.2 turnovers through six games with the Knicks, hitting 40.9% from the field in that span. He's a fine option in points formats, but he's a low-end asset in category leagues.

             Drummond had a monster 18-18 game with four steals and three blocks, and Valanciunas has been known to disappear at times this season. Despite the dud, he's still averaging 10.6 points, 8.2 rebounds and a block over his last five games, meaning he's worth holding if you own him. He's been making 3-pointers lately, but missed both of his attempts tonight.

             This was the first time since Nov. 25 that DeRozan didn't attempt at least 10 shots, but the Raptors didn't really need him in the 123-94 blowout win. And 20 points and seven dimes on nine shots is pretty darn efficient.

             This was one of Blake's worst games of the season and the Pistons are reeling again, losers for three straight games.

             He hit all four of his shots from the field and did all his damage in 16 minutes. He was probably slated to play a few more minutes, but the score got out of hand late. He's basically in a timeshare with Daniel Theis right now and usually only sees minutes in the high teens, so there's not much fantasy appeal here.

Harrison's upside is noticeably higher when Evans is out and he's worth starting in standard leagues for the time being -- he gets a 5.1 usage rate bump with Evans off the floor.

He's got a good chance to finish the season in a flurry and leads the team in scoring this year.

            JaMychal Green posted his third straight double-double on Monday vs. Boston, posting 21 points (8-of-12 FGs, 3-of-3 FTs), 11 rebounds, two triples and one turnover in 34 minutes.
        
        
             He got off to a slow start in February after returning from an ankle injury, but Green is in a nice rhythm now, posting four double-doubles in his last five with averages of 13.0 points, 9.8 rebounds, 1.2 assists and 0.8 triples in that span. The Grizzlies are going to reduce the workload for veterans Marc Gasol and Tyreke Evans (ribs) going forward, but Green's minutes appear to be safe for the time being. If he's the fourth or fifth big on your roster, he's getting the job done right now.

            Isaiah Taylor is getting some run for the tanking Hawks and had 16 points, three assists and a steal in 21 minutes off the bench on Monday.
        
        
             He's scored in double figures in three straight games and the Hawks are probably going to give him solid minutes going forward. The Hawks need to groom him to be Dennis Schroder's backup, so give him a look for the last few weeks of the season.

             The Grizzlies dropped their 10th straight game in a row, fell to 0-10 on the road vs. Eastern Conference teams and are now 18-41 on the season. It's no secret that the Grizzlies are tanking, and that means they could be shady going forward. Gasol just turned 33, the Grizzlies are planning to reduce his minutes and they may continue to rest him sporadically, but his fantasy owners are just hoping he isn't completely shut down.

             Prince has been putting up much better numbers of late and the buyout of Ersan Ilyasova helps him quite a bit. However, part of the Hawks' problem tonight was just chucking up 3-pointers, and Prince chucked up more of them than anyone else on the team, and also made his share of mistakes (like fouling Brandon Ingram too late, etc.). But the Hawks are in full tank mode and appear to be happy to let Prince make mistakes and learn from them, and after being dropped in a lot of leagues in January, he should be owned everywhere again.

             JC was in some foul trouble tonight and this was a garbage-time special late, so it just wasn't meant to be. The tank is on big time in Atlanta, but Collins should take off now that Ersan Ilyasova has been bought out. It just wasn't meant to happen for Collins tonight.

Apart from a 3-point dud vs. the Lakers, Powell has been having a strong February and is worth owning in standard leagues.

             Anderson dealt with a hip issue back in October, so perhaps he aggravated the injury during Sunday's win in Denver. With this being the second night of a back-to-back, there's a slightly higher chance that Anderson could sit, which would result in more minutes for guys like P.J. Tucker and Luc Mbah a Moute. Check back closer to tip-off for official confirmation on his status.

             This comes from the official game notes so we don't know the severity or even what type of illness he's dealing with. Brandan Wright (knee, rest) is sitting this one out, so we could see Tarik Black and Nene step up if Capela can't go.

             This will be Gordon's second straight game on the sidelines due to the illness, and for now, we'll consider him questionable for Wednesday's game against the Clippers. Joe Johnson will again have the opportunity for extended minutes tonight, but he hasn't done enough in Houston to warrant much attention in fantasy hoops.

             Noel will sit out Monday's game, but he does appear to be getting closer to a return after undergoing thumb surgery back in December. That said, Noel was only averaging 12.5 minutes per game with the Mavs prior to going down, and there are no guarantees that Dallas will turn him loose towards the second half of the season, so he's a wait-and-see guy in most settings.

His minutes will be divvied up between Justin Holiday, David Nwaba and Denzel Valentine, with Holiday offering the most upside.RotoGrinders.com Daily Slant: With LaVine and Zipser both out, Denzel Valentine and David Nwaba both have an even clearer path to playing time, and with the Bulls clearly looking to the future, it's possible a guy like Valentine steals a little run from Justin Holiday this evening. Nwaba has played well with the starting unit since the ASB and should push for upwards of 32-34 minutes if this one stays close throughout, keeping him squarely on the DFS radar at his current prices.

Wojnarowski adds that Leonard plans to resume working with the team at the Spurs' practice facility this week, and while he won't immediately go through full practices, his goal is to advance toward that level of engagement in the ""near future."" We can't guarantee that he'll play in March, but you can't leave him on the wire following this report.

             ""It's a big difference for me,"" DSJ said. ""Like I said, I've been playing point guard for my whole life since I've been playing basketball, so it's a huge adjustment... Everybody's saying I'm the point guard of the future -- I'm playing the two though."" Smith Jr. has seriously struggled while operating at the two-spot alongside J.J. Barea, but Rick Carlisle is trying to develop his skill set. Hopefully, for DSJ owners, this experiment won't last much longer.

             ""Coming back from the All-Star break I was looking forward to playing really well down the stretch,"" said Chandler, who wasn’t able to get through Monday's shootaround. ""So it’s disappointing coming back having to deal with this."" The pain in Chandler's neck has been so severe at times that he hasn't been able to turn his head at all, so it sounds like this thing could turn into an extended absence. Alex Len will continue to start in his absence and is worth a look in deep leagues.RotoGrinders.com Daily Slant: We've been loading up on Len in the three games Chandler has missed, and he hasn't disappointed, posting 46, 37 and 33 fantasy points. Despite a strong string of recent performances and Chandler's continued absence, Len's price hasn't climbed all that much and with the Suns needing to stay big tonight, he should yet again provide solid value.

             When Baynes sat out on Saturday vs. the Knicks, Daniel Theis started and played 18 minutes with six points, seven rebounds, one assist and one block, while Greg Monroe played just 11 minutes with six points and three boards. The Celtics also played a lot of small ball with Marcus Morris logging 30 minutes. We should have an update soon, but there isn't a lot of fantasy implications here.

             He's already been ruled out of Monday's contest vs. Boston, but he dodged a bullet here. ""We're not expecting it to be a long absence,"" coach J.B. Bickerstaff said. ""He's had this injury before. So we expect to see him back soon."" Andrew Harrison gets a 5.1 usage rate bump with Evans off the floor and is a strong streaming option tonight, while we should see more of Mario Chalmers as well. The Grizzlies even used a 3-big lineup in their last game, so Jarrell Martin could see a bump too.

             He has a sprained MCL and a non-displaced fracture of his tibial plateau and has missed Orlando's last 37 games. ""He hasn’t practiced, so he isn’t really that close [to returning],"" coach Frank Vogel said. Ross was playing three-on-three before the All-Star break, but suffered a minor setback that he called ""just a little bruise."" He'll likely have heavy restrictions if he's cleared this season, so there's no reason to stash him.

KCP has played 30+ minutes in six straight games, scoring 14+ points in five of those contests including a 34-point game on Saturday with eight triples. With that said, it will be interesting to see how the Lakers handle his minutes in March and April since he has an expiring deal.

Evans did have some nice moments during his rookie season, but he hasn't played since Jan. 20 and he's currently without a timetable to return. He isn't worth owning in most fantasy leagues.

            Wilson Chandler scored 10 points on 5-of-10 shooting vs. Houston on Sunday, with three rebounds, three assists, three blocks and just one turnover in 32 minutes.
        
        
             Chandler was coming off a nice performance with 18 points, 16 rebounds and four triples, and he's playing a huge role for the Nuggets as they fight to maintain a playoff berth. The veteran was averaging 37.5 minutes over the past four games and is worth scooping up if he's still available. His playing time will likely take a hit when Paul Millsap (wrist) returns, and he could cede the starting job, but most owners should take a wait-and-see approach.

             Harris came in shooting 48.7% from the field (39.9% from deep), and his solid percentages from the SG position are part of his appeal in category leagues. He couldn't buy a bucket tonight, but still contributed with two rebounds, two assists, one block and a season-high-tying five steals. He committed zero turnovers and continues to find ways to make fantasy owners happy, even when his shots aren't falling.

             Lyles tied his season-high with the four dimes, which he's done twice before this season, and he continues to give the second unit some scoring punch. The bad news is that Lyles' minutes have dipped to 19.6 over the past five games, and that's unlikely to improve when Paul Millsap (wrist) returns in 1-2 weeks.

            The Rockets extended their win streak to 12 straight games on Sunday, with P.J. Tucker contributing nine points, five rebounds, three 3-pointers, two assists and one steal in 24 minutes.
        
        
             Tucker's defense may have been the impetus for coach Mike D'Antoni to start him ahead of Ryan Anderson (eight points, five boards in 20 minutes), but he's been no slouch offensively. The Rockets are a pristine 19-1 when Tucker makes multiple 3-pointers in a game, and he's done that nine times during the current 12-game win streak. He has an 8.9% usage rate in that span, though, and offers nothing beyond threes and a trickle of steals and boards.

He scored 17 points in the first quarter alone and has been as-advertised for fantasy owners. Anthony Davis is right there with Harden for the No. 1 spot in most fantasy settings, and both AD and Harden benefit from a terrific schedule down the stretch -- the Pelicans and Rockets each play four games in Weeks 21, 22 and 23. Let the good times roll.

             Capela came in with 10+ points in 11 consecutive games, which tied his career-best streak.

             Ariza, who recently missed nine games with a hamstring strain, could play fewer minutes with coach Mike D'Antoni willing to use a deeper rotation. ""[If players] don't get all hung up on stats or numbers, then yeah, it's definitely a benefit,"" D'Antoni said about a deep rotation. Ariza said his playing time ""doesn't really matter, as long as when I'm out there, I play my hardest."" That wasn't such an issue tonight without Eric Gordon (illness), but is worth monitoring down the stretch. Regardless, Ariza is a solid mid-round option in category-based leagues.

Rockets coach Mike D'Antoni likes to refer to 'vertical spacing' with bigs who can run the floor, and the 30-year-old Wright could have enough in the tank to crack the rotation in certain matchups, especially if Nene is out. That said, there's no obvious fantasy appeal here.

             Porter was cruising as a top-40 value while John Wall was healthy, despite having a modest 17.6% usage rate -- the only player with higher fantasy value and lower usage rate in that span was Draymond Green. Ever since Wall had knee surgery, Porter has crept even higher, flirting with second-round value and a usage rate of 20.7%. He's not quite as valuable in points leagues, but you won't hear any owners complaining about Porter's return-on-investment this season.

             Last season, Covington shot 38.3% before the All-Star break but hit 43.7% after the break. This season he's on the opposite trajectory -- he made 44.6% of his attempts in October and November, but hasn't been above 38.4% in the three months since then. The other concern is the arrival of Marco Belinelli. Covington is averaging 28.3 minutes with Belinelli in the lineup, compared to 32.4 minutes prior to Belinelli's arrival. It's a situation worth monitoring closely.

             Holmes played 21 minutes on Saturday, but that was due to Amir Johnson resting in the first game of a back-to-back set -- coach Brett Brown said he wanted to keep Holmes engaged despite frequent DNP-CDs. As if his role wasn't chaotic enough, Philly is expected to sign Ersan Ilyasova now that he's been bought out by the Hawks. Barring a rash of injuries in Philly's frontcourt, there's no reason to own Holmes.

             Embiid's performance had added significance for fantasy owners, because it was the second half of a back-to-back set. He recorded his 31st double-double of the season and has now scored at least 20 points in seven of his last eight games. He shows no signs of slowing down with 9-of-20 FGs and 5-of-6 FTs tonight, and he even made two 3-pointers for good measure.

             Simmons' versatility continues to impress Sixers fans, fantasy owners, and his own teammates and coaches. ""It’s staggering the distance he can cover on limited dribbles,"" said coach Brett Brown. Simmons isn't bashful about his unique skill-set, either, saying recently, ""I’m 6-10, I can pass the ball, I’m fast, I’m strong, I’m quick."" If you ignore his 56.7% free-throw shooting, he's leading the field for rookie fantasy value ahead of fellow ROY candidate Donovan Mitchell.

             It's unclear whether Johnson's absence on Saturday was a precaution in the first half of a back-to-back set, or the Sixers were experimenting with their frontcourt rotations. Trevor Booker logged 23 minutes on Saturday but only nine minutes tonight, and the rotation gets even murkier with Ersan Ilyasova reportedly set to sign with Philly this week. Suffice to say, fantasy owners shouldn't put their faith in Johnson, Booker or Richaun Holmes at any league depth.

             Redick turned it over three times in 30 minutes tonight, and eventually checked out with 2:02 remaining and his team down by 15 points. He certainly wasn't alone in his struggles, as Philly shot 36.0% as a team including Dario Saric's 5-of-17 shooting dud. Tired legs may have been a factor in the second of back-to-back games, but they don't play consecutive games again until Mar. 15/16.

             Gasol appeared to tweak his knee during the game and although he dismissed concerns, the Spurs will obviously err on the side of caution here. San Antonio only plays twice this week, beginning Wednesday vs. the visiting Pelicans, so maybe the two days of rest will be enough for Pau to fully recover.

             Bell hasn't played since Jan. 15 and the Warriors aren't likely to play him many minutes in his first game back. That makes him a very risky DFS and streaming play even if he is cleared to go on Monday, but deep-league owners should already be monitoring him as a potential pickup.

He's shooting just 36.8% on catch-and-shoots this season, but that does include a solid 37.6% mark from downtown.

             All of Nance's assists came in the second quarter, which tied his career-high for a single quarter. Cleveland is still 4-2 since overhauling their roster at the deadline, and Nance has proven to be a great fit coming off the bench -- the low playing time tonight was partly due to foul trouble. He faces an eventual threat from Kevin Love (hand), but for now he's a safe play in 12-team leagues and deeper.

             The Spurs threw the kitchen sink at him with five different defenders in the first half alone, but as usual LeBron continued to do his thing. His efforts were wasted, however, as his fellow starters combined for a mere 14 points on 6-of-28 shooting. Although he fell one dime shy of a triple-double tonight, he still made history by passing Rod Strickland for 11th place all-time in assists (7,988). The best news for fantasy owners is that with Cleveland in the thick of a competitive playoff race, LeBron should be protected from dreaded DNP-rest days.

             Seven of Thompson's rebounds came on the offensive end, which makes it more disappointing that he finished just 3-of-7 from the field. The 26-year-old remains a decent source of FG% and rebounds, but he offers almost nothing else for fantasy -- backup Larry Nance Jr. (four points, four boards, four assists, two steals, two blocks) is more appealing in almost any format.

Mirotic again struggled with his shot, going 5-of-15 from the field and 3-of-3 from the charity stripe on his way to 14 points, seven rebounds, one 3-pointer, one assist and three turnovers, but the four swats should appease his fantasy owners.

Fellow reserve Bryn Forbes scored 12 points on 4-of-7 shooting, while Danny Green added 22 points on 6-of-11 shooting, and Parker's offense wasn't required in an eventual 110-94 road win.

            Dejounte Murray filled the boxscore on Sunday with 13 points, nine rebounds, five assists, four steals and three blocks during a 110-94 win vs. Cleveland.
        
        
             Murray scored 10 of his 13 points in the fourth quarter, helping San Antonio close out their 'Rodeo road trip' with a much-needed victory. He's the only point guard in the league with 4+ steals and 3+ blocks in a game this season, which highlights his unique skills and fantasy potential. Poor percentages have dragged him down in many formats this season, but he's cruising over the past five games and is worth owning if you need a PG.

             Aldridge missed a few games prior to the break with knee soreness, and it looks like the extended rest did the trick -- in the past two games he's averaged 32.5 points, 5.5 rebounds and 3.0 assists. His efforts helped the Spurs avoid their first five-game losing skid since 2010-11, and moved them into a virtual tie with the Timberwolves for the No. 3 seed in the West. That playoff-seeding battle should help Aldridge avoid onerous restrictions and DNPs down the stretch.

             This was the Pelicans second consecutive overtime win coming out of the All-Star break, and they're now 7-2 in overtime games this season, with all seven of those wins coming against Eastern Conference opponents. AD and Jrue Holiday were huge in helping New Orleans overcome an 18-point halftime deficit, and the Pelicans are now on a five-game win streak, which is the first time the franchise has accomplished that feat under head coach Alvin Gentry.

             Anderson shot 4-of-7 from the field without any turnovers in 30 minutes of action. He's not a flashy fantasy option and doesn't offer much in points leagues, but roto owners appreciate his sneaky value. He's managed to post mid-round value with season averages of 8.2 points (52.0% FGs, 74.1% FTs), 0.2 threes, 5.7 rebounds, 2.8 assists, 1.4 steals, 0.8 blocks and just 1.4 turnovers. Just be aware that the Spurs only play twice next week.

             As an added bonus for 9-cat owners Moore didn't turn the ball over once in this overtime win, and he continues to serve as a reliable source of triples and steals, although the inconsistent scoring constrains his value to deep leagues.

             Green tied his season-high with five 3-pointers and he fell just shy of his high for scoring (24 points on Nov. 7). This was his first game as a reserve since 2014 and the early results were encouraging -- with Kawhi Leonard (quad) out indefinitely, he could still carve out 24-26 minutes if he sticks in a bench role. He's still just a fringe option better suited to roto leagues.

             Holiday really struggled through the first half of action, but he dominated the second half and overtime, scoring 26 of his 36 points while rocking a ridiculous 44.6 usage rate. This was Holiday's fifth straight 20+ point performance, and the sixth time this season he had 30 points or more, which accounts for the most 30-point games he's had in a single season. After struggling with injuries and various restrictions over the past four seasons, he's finally healthy and having himself a career-year.

             February has been Rondo’s best month as he’s come through with averages of 10.7 points, 8.9 dimes, 5.1 boards, 1.1 triple, 1.1 steal and 2.7 turnovers per game on 50.0% shooting from the field and 30.8% from the charity stripe, which has been good enough for top-90 value in 9-cat leagues if you’re punting free throws. Jameer Nelson’s departure has opened up minutes for Rondo, so he should be able to flirt with these numbers to close out the year.

             This is pretty much your standard Henson line, and while there was some fear heading into the All-Star break that he was in danger of losing minutes to Tyler Zeller, that looks like a non-issue at this point. Zeller got minutes for the first time since the break on Sunday, but finished with just two points, three rebounds, one assist and one turnover in 11 minutes off the bench.

             The Grizzlies are also playing without Chandler Parsons (illness) and Tyreke Evans (ribs), so minutes should be plentiful for guys like Dillon Brooks, Jarell Martin and even Kobi Simmons, who logged 23 minutes on Saturday.

             Parsons returned for the Grizzlies' final game before the break, but he's now been sidelined by an illness since Thursday. The oft-injured veteran will be on a suffocating minute-limit whenever he is cleared to play, and there's no fantasy value here.

             Middleton hit a huge, step-back jumper over E'Twaun Moore with under a minute left to tie up the game for Milwaukee, and he was the lead dog during the overtime period, posting a crazy 50.0 usage rate. Unfortunately, he went iso against Nikola Mirotic on one of the Bucks' final few possessions, which ended with him getting swatted and Milwaukee went on to lose the game.

             Evans was due to have an MRI on Sunday and owners should sit tight while we await the results. He was reportedly feeling good on Saturday and this could be a simple precaution, as Memphis has zero incentive to play Evans -- they're headed to the draft lottery and he's headed to unrestricted free agency. Andrew Harrison and Mario Chalmers stand to benefit with more ball-handling duties, and Jarell Martin could earn another start if Memphis opts to go big.

             Bledsoe was also a perfect 4-of-4 from the charity stripe, and he came through with some clutch shots down the stretch to push the game into overtime, but New Orleans was simply too good to overcome in OT. As for Bledsoe's left wrist, it was a complete non-issue through the entirety of Sunday's game, so he should be fine moving forward.

             Ilyasova spent time in Philly last year, so he's familiar with Brett Brown's system, and he'll help add some depth and 3-point shooting to the 76ers' frontcourt. However, it's unlikely he'll earn enough minutes with the 76ers to make a meaningful impact in fantasy hoops, so he's safe to leave on the waiver wire in all leagues.

             While MCW did play better than usual, Detroit didn't play with much enthusiasm on defense, and he did most of his damage during garbage time.

He also went 5-of-10 from the field and 1-of-1 from the stripe to give him an elite 71.8 true shooting percentage on the evening, and he probably would have had an even juicier stat line if the game weren't such a blowout.

             D12 was very active in this one, gobbling up the offensive boards (20.0 OREB%) and scoring on putbacks and alley-oops. He’s not quite the elite shot blocker that he used to be, but he’s been more involved in the offense in Charlotte and is having a bit of a bounce-back year in his age-32 season. As an added bonus, he hasn’t missed a single game this year, but with 12 technical to date, he’s just four away from incurring a mandatory one-game suspension.

            Andre Drummond posted a 14-point, 14-rebound double-double on Sunday, to go with one assist, one steal, one block and one turnover in 32 minutes.
        
        
             Drummond was solid, but Detroit's bench was particularly awful in this one, which resulted in Charlotte going on huge runs whenever the starters left the floor. As a side note, Drummond’s assist numbers have seen a major dip since Blake Griffin's arrival, and with Griffin being the more talented playmaker, that trend will likely continue.

            Blake Griffin netted 20 points on 10-of-18 shooting Sunday, to go with four rebounds, four assists and six turnovers across 31 minutes.
        
        
             Griffin was shutout on the glass with Andre Drummond and Dwight Howard going to battle on the boards, and he also missed all three of his 3-point attempts, but him going away from the 3-point shot helped him shoot a higher percentage. The Pistons did a better job of getting him touches in the post, so perhaps Stan Van Gundy realizes that allowing Griffin to jack up 6.2 triple per contest when he's connecting on just 30.4% of those attempts isn't the wisest maneuver.

            Stanley Johnson was quite through 28 minutes of action during Sunday's blowout loss to the Hornets, finishing with nine points, one triple, three boards, one steal and one turnover.
        
        
             Johnson didn’t even attempt his first shot until midway through the second quarter, a shot that he bricked, and he was more-or-less invisible throughout the game. Detroit allowed 70 points by halftime, which was the second-most amount of point they've allowed through any half this season, and this game was a train wreck from start to finish for the Pistons.

            Ish Smith scored 13 points on 6-of-11 shooting Sunday, to go with one 3-pointer, one rebound, eight assists, two steals and two turnovers in 28 minutes.
        
        
             Smith did a nice job of getting to the rack, and he’s been crushing it in the paint over the past three games, connecting on 90.9% of his shot attempts at the rim. Reggie Jackson is expected to get back to the court sometime in March, but he’ll likely be eased back into things after a lengthy layoff, so his return won’t immediately sink Smith’s value.

            Reggie Bullock went 5-of-14 from the field and 3-of-4 from the stripe on his way to 14 points, one 3-pointer, three rebounds, five assists and one turnover in 30 minutes.
        
        
             The Pistons came out fairly flat in this one, and Bullock struggled to get going due to some tough defense from Nicolas Batum, missing his first four shots and not connecting from beyond the arc until mid-way through the third quarter. As a team, Detroit only put in four 3-pointers on 4-of-18 shooting, which was a season-low and helped contribute to the blowout loss.

He'll siphon away minutes from guys like Nik Stauskas and Joe Harris once he's fully up to speed.

             RHJ and LeVert could be dealing with a minutes limit in their first game back from lengthy layoffs, but Hollis-Jefferson is worth swooping up in most leagues if he was cut during the injury. RHJ's return to the court will result in fewer minutes for Quincy Acy and Joe Harris, and LeVert might push Nik Stauskas out of the rotation entirely.

             The good news is that he hasn't yet been ruled out for the season, and Shams Charania of Yahoo! Sports reported on Saturday that there's a chance Butler could return in 4-6 weeks. We haven't been made aware the exact procedure Butler underwent, but if he is able to return this season that would likely mean he underwent a meniscectomy, which is complete removal of meniscus. Butler will likely be limited upon his return, but a 4-6 week window would give him the opportunity to return during the fantasy playoffs. Andrew Wiggins will be one of the primary beneficiaries here, and Nemanja Bjelica has some deep league appeal as the fill-in starter.

            Eric Bledsoe (left wrist soreness) is expected to play on Sunday vs. the Pelicans according to coach Joe Prunty.
        
        
             The injury happened late in Friday's game and the Bucks listed him as probable on the injury report. Bledsoe will be re-evaluated after warmups and is technically a game-time call, but barring a setback, he should be fine.

             Coach Nate McMillan isn't expecting Collison to return during their road trip, so the earliest we will see him based on that timetable is Mar. 5 against the Bucks at home. Cory Joseph and Joe Young will hold down the fort at point guard with Lance Stephenson getting a bump in value off the bench.

""I’m going to focus on this season, finish this season."" Kanter has been very productive with the Knicks and it's best for his fantasy value if he stays in New York.

             He practiced in the G-League and got in a couple games as well, setting him up for a return as soon as Monday vs. the Thunder. Isaac has plenty of upside, but we expect the Magic to bring him along very slowly which could limit his fantasy appeal for a while.

             According to coach Brad Stevens, the Celtics want Hayward to do more conditioning and strength work on an anti-gravity treadmill before clearing him to travel. ""It doesn’t look like it’s any time in the next couple of weeks,"" Stevens said. ""We talked the other day. He’s gonna do another alter-G process or progress starting on Sunday where he goes from 60 percent of his body weight all the way to 100, and then once he gets to 100 — once he can do stuff where he’s running or jumping, then it makes sense to bring him on the road."" There's been no indication that we'll see Hayward return this season.

             ""Joe Johnson played really well,"" coach Mike D’Antoni said on Friday. ""He’s getting more comfortable, especially in the second half. I’ve known Joe forever and he’s a machine. He just keeps playing, doesn’t get tired, he’s strong, and just really understands his game. If you watch it, he’s really good."" Johnson has played 31 and 22 minutes in his first two games as a Rocket, a number that will surely go down once Eric Gordon gets healthy. There's no reason to own Johnson outside of very deep leagues.

             In other words, it's not a lock that he will be used over Amir Johnson again. ""Right now my motivation is I know that Richaun has value, I know that he has things that he can bring to the table and I respect how he’s handled himself when he wasn’t playing that much,"" Brown said. ""I know it’s my job to keep him alive and tonight was an example of that and I thought he did very very well."" Holmes ended up with four points, eight rebounds, four assists, one steal and one block in 21 minutes, and it's almost absurd at this point that Brown has been using Amir Johnson over him this long. We'll see what happens Sunday.

             He had four points in six minutes during his debut and is fitting in nicely with the Knicks. ""It’s me trying to fit into the system,’’ Williams said. ""They’ve been doing this for the season. I’m not trying to change nothing. I’m trying to fit into the program. It’s coming naturally."" The Knicks wanted to get more athletic and Williams  can certainly bring that to the table. With the Knicks in rebuilding mode, we could see a lot more of Williams if he continues to play well.

            Isaiah Thomas went for 17 points off the bench across 23 minutes in Saturday's 113-108 win at Sacramento.
        
        
             Thomas hit 4-of-11 from the field, including 3-of-7 from behind the 3-point line, while added four assists, two rebounds and just two turnovers. He is still getting used to his teammates and his role off the bench with his new club. He'll likely get better as time goes by, and he'll play plenty of minutes when Lonzo Ball (knee) needs to take a break in-game or needs a night off.

            Brook Lopez finished Saturday's 113-108 victory at Sacramento with four blocked shots over 24 minutes.
        
        
             Lopez also added 11 points on 5-of-12 shooting while grabbing two rebounds and a steal, but the swats were definitely the highlight of the night for fantasy owners. It was just the second time he has hit double digits in points across the past six outings dating back to Feb. 6. Lopez is fighting to hold off Ivica Zubac for playing time in the middle. His minutes should remain in the 20s, so he continues to be a fantasy asset in most leagues.

             Ingram never really threatened to notch the triple-double, but he was close. He hit 5-of-12 from the field, including 1-of-3 from behind the 3-point line, while going a perfect 2-of-2 from the stripe. He also added a blocked shot and turned it over just one time. Ingram has fired out of the chute following the All-Star break, averaging 14.0 PPG, 8.0 RPG, 5.5 APG, 2.0 BPG and 1.0 SPG in two outings.

The eight triples were tied for the third-most in a single game in franchise history, He also chipped in with seven rebounds and two assists while turning it over zero times. KCP remains a solid hold in most standard fantasy formats.

             After the game, head coach Luke Walton said he feels Randle has been playing very consistent with energy and impact. He said he has been hard on Randle because he feels the 23-year-old from the University of Kentucky can be a dominant player if he keeps pushing. Randle was dominant Friday, posting a triple-double, and he is averaging 15.0 PPG, 13.0 RPG and 8.0 APG over his past two outings.

             Favors was a pretty effective 6-of-11 from the field, but he was just 2-of-4 from the free-throw line. He also added six rebounds, an assist and a blocked shot for a solid, yet unspectacular overall stat line. He'll be back at it on Monday against the visiting Rockets to kick off a three-game scoring period.

             Ingles, who was a bit feisty in this one, especially on one occasion toward the referee, was perhaps a bit angry because of his 4-of-12 shooting night, including 2-of-8 from behind the arc. He added eight assists, four rebounds, two steals and two blocked shots to have a pretty decent fantasy stat line, as long as missed shots do not cost you too much.

             Rubio helped out fantasy owners with six assists, five rebounds and a steal while turning it over just once, and he ended up with a plus-14 rating. But he is just 4-of-15 from the field in two games since returning after a three-game absence due to a hip injury, and perhaps he is not quite 100 percent yet. He is averaging just 5.7 PPG, 4.3 APG, 3.7 RPG and 1.7 SPG over his past three outings. Despite the struggles you have to stick with him. He was red hot before the hip injury.

             It wasn't a giant stat line for Gobert, but it marked his fifth double-double over the past six outings. The only bad news was that the Stifle Tower was held without a block for just the second time over the past 23 full outings dating back to early November. Even without a block, he remains an obvious solid fantasy option for his offense and rebounding ability.

He hit 3-of-5 from the floor in this one, and he was a perfect 4-of-4 from the free-throw line, while also adding an assist, a steal and a blocked shot. Before the All-Star break he was on fire, and while the buy-low window remains cracked open, it might slam shut soon if he picks up the pace.

On a positive note, at least he didn't cough up any turnovers. He'll look for redemption Monday against the Pacers, starting a four-game week.

            Dirk Nowitzki (back) was able to start Saturday's game at Utah and he finished with 12 points and 10 rebounds.
        
        
             Nowitzki went to the locker room during Friday's game due to a lower back injury and it appeared a certainty that the veteran would sit with the back-to-back situation. However, instead of looking rusty, tired or banged up, he looked rejuvenated, also adding three blocked shots with two assists and just one turnover across 32 minutes, working with no restrictions.

            Taj Gibson rolled up 19 points with 10 rebounds over 36 minutes in Saturday's home victory against Chicago.
        
        
             Gibson stepped up his game against his former team, hitting 7-of-11 from the field while going 5-of-7 from the free-throw line. He also was able to dish out three assists with a steal while adding a plus-13 rating. It's all hands on deck in the Twin Cities with Jimmy Butler (knee) going down with a longer-term injury, so everyone will see their offensive responsibilities increase.

            Andrew Wiggins ended up with 23 points over 35 minutes in Saturday's 122-104 victory against the visiting Bulls.
        
        
             Wiggins picked up the pace, hitting 10-of-18 from the field, including 2-of-6 from behind the 3-point line, as he, Jeff Teague and Karl-Anthony Towns banded together to fill the void left by Jimmy Butler (knee). Wiggins also chipped in with two assists, two rebounds, a steal and a blocked shot. He doesn't do much outside of the scoring categories, but a little help in the other categories was much appreciated.

             Teague hasn't been terribly aggressive on offense this season, but he is enjoying his hottest stretch of the season. He joined forces with Andrew Wiggins to try and pick up the offensive slack with Jimmy Butler (knee) on the mend. Teague is averaging 20.0 PPG, 7.0 APG, 4.0 APG and 1.4 SPG over his past contests. Next up will be a favorable matchup Monday in Sacramento, kicking off a three-game work week.

             KAT went 9-of-20 from the field, including 0-of-5 from behind the 3-point line, but that's about all fantasy owners could really complain about. He also finished with a game-high plus-23 rating, and he now has at least one blocked shot in five consecutive outings. Towns is also working on a four-game double-double run.

             The Blazers looked very tired in this game coming off a back-to-back set, but Dame was there to save the day. Lillard is at an MVP level right now and was already en fuego before this gem, averaging 31.0 points, 3.6 boards, 6.3 assists, 1.1 steals and 3.1 treys in his previous February games. Dame Dolla was a league-winning player after the break last year and he's looking like he'll be doing it again. Check your watch.

             He had a very big game on Friday with six steals, but Harkless was right back to his quiet ways today. It's really hard to trust coach Terry Stotts when it comes to players not named Dame Lillard, C.J. McCollum and Jusuf Nurkic.

             Portis hit 6-of-13 from the field, including 1-of-3 from behind the arc, while adding 2-of-2 from the free-throw line. He also helped out with four rebounds, an assist and just one steal. It wasn't quite the 38 points he posted in Thursday's game against Philadelphia, but this is a more realistic line on what to expect from Portis. He has emerged as a must-start fantasy option across the board.

             He's said he wants to play the rest of the way and the Suns are probably going to allow him to do whatever he wants. The break likely helped Booker get his torso injury right and it's not too farfetched to think he can flirt with 30 per game going forward. He'll need to avoid minor injuries to stay in the lineup.

             That definitely works. Not much analysis needed here with Len playing well in both of his back-to-back games against tough matchups, which followed his monster game before the break. He should be owned in all leagues now that he looks healthy, and his owners can just cross the injury bridge when they get to it.

             Nwaba also chipped in with nine rebounds with just two turnovers, although he was credited with an ugly minus-16 rating, worst in the game. And if you want to split hairs, his 2-of-4 line from the charity stripe wasn't terribly attractive, either. He'll look to keep up the hot shooting Monday in Brooklyn, the first of a three-game week.

             Felicio was outstanding, hitting 5-of-8 from the field, while adding three rebounds, three assists and two blocked shots. He continues to start with Robin Lopez grabbing some pine for the second consecutive game as a healthy scratch. The Bulls appear committed to using their younger players and seeing what they can do, and that's great news for fantasy owners in deeper leagues using Felicio.

             Markkanen was able to salvage the stat line somewhat with seven rebounds, two blocked shots and a steal, but the shooting performance was terrible. The 20-year-old Finn has stumbled out of the break, averaging just 3.0 PPG with 7.5 RPG and 1.5 BPG while shooting just 12.5 percent (2-of-16) over the past two outings. He'll look for better results Monday in Brooklyn, the start of a three-game week.

             He had a lot of open looks from deep, but he couldn't knock them down. Had he been able to, this line would look a lot better. Still, the 33 minutes is a great sign and coach Tom Thibodeau sure does like to play his starters together a lot. Bjelica should be better and should be owned in standard leagues.

He's OK in points leagues, but even Jimmy Butler's absence only gives him late-round upside in nine-category leagues.

             Well, the Warriors are back with two impressive wins to start their second half. Their schedule gets extremely soft going forward with several games against Eastern Conference cellar-dwelling teams and they play the Suns three times. From a fantasy perspective, the best news for the Warriors is they're tied with the Rockets for the No. 1 seed, so that should force Steve Kerr's hand to some degree to play his studs.

             He's been a sneaky beneficiary from the Warriors losing confidence in their center spot and he guarded Russell Westbrook at times. Young is still as wild as it gets, so anyone thinking of adding him in deep leagues should know you may wind up dropping him the next time out.

             The Warriors went with a lot of small-ball lineups and that may continue because coach Steve Kerr doesn't really seem satisfied with his centers right now. Green was listed on the injury report with a shoulder injury today and the Warriors schedule gets extremely easy the rest of the way, so it's fair to expect some rest for Dray going forward.

             OKC had a brutal offensive night with their season-low in points and FG%. As for Westbrook, he's back to having some efficiency issues again with four straight games under his season 44.2 FG%. Not coincidentally, he is taking more 3-pointers and he's not making them to pull him down, so that explains it. Westbrook is still feasting on the stat sheet in his triple-double categories, so he's doing just fine as DFS's best scorer. Not so much in nine-cat leagues, though.

             Yikes. George lit up the Warriors back on Feb. 6 with his 38 points in a big win at Oracle, but he was in bizarro world today. The Thunder struggled to get their offense going early with PG and Russell Westbrook failing to get into a rhythm. George was one of the hottest players in fantasy hoops before this dud, so expect him to rebound against the Magic on Monday.

            Trey Burke went off yet again during a 121-112 loss to the Celtics on Saturday, matching a season-high 26 points with eight assists, one steal and two 3-pointers in 26 minutes.
        
        
             He just scored 26 points on Thursday and is suddenly one of the hottest bench players in the NBA. Burke's shot selection has still been all over the place and this hot stretch is based on him making jumpers, which is a usually a strong indicator that it's not sustainable. That aside, it's kind of hard to argue back-to-back 26-point games on a team lacking offensive punch, so Burke is worth an add in 12-team leagues to see if he keeps it going. Although, his prospective owners shouldn't have high expectations.

             He made 4-of-12 from the field and 5-of-8 from the line, so this was basically your quintessential Mudiay line. He'll fill up the counting stats and his usage rate should be high, but his nine-cat value won't be great because of the hit on percentages and turnovers. If you don't care about that, he may have some value for you.

             He's losing some serious minutes right now, so it's probably time to be concerned as a fantasy owner. Lee usually only needs around 25-27 minutes to post decent value, but playing just 15.0 per game in the last two since the break really stings. He's not an absolute drop, but it's certainly an option for a hot add.

             It's going to be quite a squeeze on minutes at guard in Brooklyn, so LeVert may only get the backup PG minutes. Considering how the Nets will take it easy on him, most fantasy owners can take a wait-and-see approach.

             That's back-to-back games with five steals for J-Rich and he becomes the only player in the NBA with that occurrence multiple times within the last year (April 2017). The only other players with even one multiple-game streak of five-plus steals are Victor Oladipo and Robert Covington (Basketball Reference). Richardson continues to just smash his ADP and he's probably going to be on a lot of winning fantasy teams this season.

             Well, this came out of nowhere. Winslow was one of the worst shooters in the league this month before today, making just 25.0 percent from the field for 5.0 points per game in his previous February games. Kelly Olynyk (shoulder) coming back would also hurt his playing time, so there's really no reason to add Winslow after this shocker.

             The Grizzlies wanted to slide him up to the three to allow more power forward minutes to be available, and it didn't really work out. Maybe this will change next time out, but either way Martin is only worth a look in deep leagues.

Davis should see regular minutes going forward with most of them coming as the backup, but Marc Gasol's minutes should be dropping even when he's active. Davis is still more of a stash than anything else with some standalone value in deeper leagues.

             He got the night off on a back-to-back set, and the sense around the team is that more rest is coming. Plus, the Grizzlies will likely be dialing back his minutes. Gasol is still worth owning in all leagues, but his upside is no longer as an early-round player.

             Coach Brett Brown left his second unit in down the stretch in the fourth quarter despite the Magic cutting a big lead to as little as nine with 2:15 left. After the game, Embiid said he is planning on playing in the back-to-back set against the Wizards on Sunday, so he should be all set for that one. As for his team, they're the hottest team in the Eastern Conference, they've won seven straight, and they're the healthiest they've been in years. It's certainly possible they can earn a top-four seed.

             Typically, a 4-6 week timeline is tied to a medial meniscectomy, so that may be what Butler has planned -- lateral or medial has not been specified yet. This basically rules Butler out until April, so his fantasy owners will have to figure out how important their next 4-6 weeks are. Dropping him is an option while adding Nemanja Bjelica makes sense.

             The biggest takeaway for Gordon is that coach Frank Vogel let him bring the ball up a lot in the fourth quarter as the Magic played without a point guard down the stretch. Before this, he looked very rusty for about the first 60 percent of the game with terrible shot selection, but Gordon finally started to move and had his jumper fall the rest of the way. The PG move is a nice little bonus and he'll trend up very soon.

             Perhaps the most noteworthy part of this game from a Magic perspective is that the Magic played most of the fourth quarter with Mario, Aaron Gordon, Jonathon Simmons, Evan Fournier and Nikola Vucevic, so they're OK going no PG. Coach Frank Vogel said he's going to play Mario ""a lot"" of minutes and it sounds like he's going to keep his word. Mario should be owned in standard leagues.

             The Magic went with a no-PG lineup in the fourth quarter with their starters and Mario Hezonja instead of DJA. Things aren't looking good for DJA since his first start after the deadline, averaging just 10.6 points, 2.0 boards, 3.6 assists, 0.2 steals and 2.0 treys on 36.8 percent from the field. He'll be better, but his upside isn't the greatest and shallow-league owners can probably do better.

             He's stuck in a slump and now he'll have to share the ball more with guys like Aaron Gordon and Nikola Vucevic. Over his last five games, Simmons averaged just 9.8 points, 3.8 boards, 4.0 assists, 1.0 steals and 0.4 terms on 36.8 percent from the field. He'll be better than this, but dropping him in a shallower league is certainly an option. He does have four games next week, though.

             The Grizzlies may want to open up more minutes at the four for guys like Ivan Rabb, so they'll slide Martin up a spot. Martin is more of a 16-team add as he adjusts to a new role. To be clear, he has played small forward at times this season.

Andrew Harrison is a strong pickup while Mario Chalmers also benefits.

             That makes the recent official report from the team of an ""injury"" a little worse. Butler and the Wolves will need to figure out the best treatment plan, which can vary from anywhere from three weeks to the rest of the season and playoffs. Butler's fantasy owners probably shouldn't be expecting him to return before April, so this is a really tough blow for those headed to the fantasy playoffs. Most of his owners may want to hold on until the surgery plan is revealed, which should be in the coming days. Although, if you need games now, cutting him is obviously an option. Nemanja Bjelica should be picked up in 12-team leagues.

            An MRI taken Saturday afternoon on Jimmy Butler's right knee revealed a meniscal injury.
        
        
             The team did not reveal any other details on the injury and did not specify the severity. If he has a tear in his meniscus, he's likely looking at around 6-8 weeks, but it's possible that's not the case. If he only needs arthroscopic surgery, it may be closer to 3-6 weeks. It's worth a mention that Butler's right knee was the same knee that kept him out a week in the first half of the season. Butler's fantasy owners just have to sit tight for now. Meanwhile, picking up Nemanja Bjelica isn't a bad idea in 12-team leagues. For Wolves fans, it sounds like Butler has a good chance to be ready for the postseason.

            Jonathon Simmons (ankle) is starting against the 76ers on Saturday.
        
        
             He was expected to play and everything likely went fine in warmups. Simmons has kind of cooled off lately, but should have a decent opportunity to run some of the offense even with Aaron Gordon and Nikola Vucevic in the mix.

             Danny Green didn't appear on the injury report, so maybe he's back to help the backcourt rotation. If Manu is out, that should give more minutes to Bryn Forbes and Patty Mills.

             He had an MRI earlier this week and there's a very good chance he's out for several more games. Alex Len has looked the part of a starting center in his last two games, and perhaps the time off from the break helped his ankles get right. Len should be owned in standard leagues.

If he can make shots and stay healthy, Fox could have a nice finish to his rookie season.

The Jazz could also be limiting Ricky Rubio in a back-to-back set, so that could mean a few more minutes for Royce O'Neale, Jae Crowder and maybe Alec Burks. O'Neale is probably the only one worth owning in 12-team leagues for now.

It appears that Cristiano Felicio, Lauri Markkanen, Bobby Portis and Noah Vonleh will divvy up the minutes up front going forward. Lopez can now be dropped in standard-sized leagues.

             This is the second straight game that Chicago has benched both Lopez and Holiday, as the Bulls are fully committed to tank mode. It now appears safe to drop Holiday in fantasy leagues. David Nwaba started for Chicago on Thursday and finished with 21 points, nine rebounds, and three 3-pointers in 33 minutes. He is worth consideration as a DFS flier on Saturday night.

            Coach JB Bickerstaff said that Tyreke Evans (right rib) would be re-evaluated prior to Saturday's game vs. Miami.
        
        
             Evans injured the rib in the second half of the Grizzlies loss to the Cavs on Friday night. He was clutching his right side as he headed to the locker room and was ruled out a short time later. Considering the Grizz are in tank mode, they will likely err on the side of caution and wait until Evans is 100 percent healthy. We should have an update on his status shortly. If Evans is unable to play Saturday night, Andrew Harrison would likely be the primary beneficiary.

             Baynes started on Friday vs. the Pistons, but logged just three minutes before injuring his elbow. Daniel Theis was the primary beneficiary in Baynes' absence. Theis scored 19 points and grabbed seven boards in 21 minutes off the bench. We should have an update on Baynes Saturday afternoon.

            Lonzo Ball (knee) returned to action Friday against the Mavericks, posting nine points in 17 minutes off the bench.
        
        
             Ball was rusty with his shot, hitting 3-of-8 from the field, although his 3-of-6 from behind the 3-point line wasn't bad. He also chipped in with seven rebounds and six assists in his limited amount of work, making for a rather impressive overall stat line. He missed six weeks due to a sprained medial collateral ligament, and now he has Isaiah Thomas to contend with for minutes. Ball has already been ruled out for Saturday's game in Sacramento, and it's likely he won't play in back-to-back situations for some time, as the team has plenty of depth to allow him to rest.

            Ivica Zubac erupted for 14 points in 18 minutes off the bench in Friday's 124-102 win against Mavericks.
        
        
             Zubac hit 6-of-7 from the floor while adding six rebounds, an assist and just one turnover. He dumped in a season-high 19 points in the game before the break against the Minnesota Timberwolves and he carried over the momentum despite the interruption from the All-Star break. Zubac still needs to do a little more work to make him a hot pickup in standard leagues, but his fantasy star is certainly rising.

            Isaiah Thomas dropped 17 points in 25 minutes off the bench in Friday's 124-102 win against the visiting Mavericks.
        
        
             Thomas went just 5-of-12 from the field, including 2-of-7 from behind the 3-point line, and he added 5-of-5 from the free-throw stripe. He also chipped in with four assists, two rebounds and two steals. It's going to take some time to jell with his new teammates, and he likely spent a lot of time doing so during the All-Star break. With Lonzo Ball (knee) back in action, there are plenty of mouths to feed and just so many minutes. IT remains more of a mid-round fantasy player as long as he is active, but look for his minutes and playing time to fluctuate based on the health and rest time of others. Ball is out Saturday in the second end of the back-to-back, so that's good news for Thomas.

             Hart hit 5-of-13 from the field, including 1-of-5 from behind the 3-point line, and he also chipped in with two assists, a steal and just one turnover while finishing with a plus-24 rating. Hart entered the month of February with just two double-doubles, but he has managed four double-doubles in his eight games since flipping the calendar from January. With Lonzo Ball (knee) back in action, it will likely hurt Hart's value, but so far so good. Head coach Luke Walton certainly has a challenge as far as handling his rotations, however. We'll monitor the situation Saturday in Sacramento.

             Ingram was a sharp 6-of-9 from the field, and he added nine rebounds, three assists, two steals and three blocked shots with a team-high tying plus-27 rating in his 29 minutes. The All-Star break did Ingram some good to give him a little rest, and it also helps facing the lowly Mavs out of the gate. The rebound total was his most since he also grabbed nine boards in back-to-back games Jan. 23-26. He'll try to keep it going Saturday in Sacramento. He posted 15 points with five rebounds and five assists in the most recent meeting with the Kings on Jan. 9.

             Randle finished 9-of-14 from the field while turning in an impressive plus-27 rating. It was his fifth-career triple-double, and the only thing that went wrong was he ended up 0-of-1 from the free-throw line. But that's splitting hairs. Randle certainly looked rejuvenated after the All-Star break. He has made at least seven successful field goals in nine consecutive outings. He'll look to keep it rolling Saturday in Sacramento against the NBA's 20th-ranked scoring defense.

McDermott is likely to get an extended look down the stretch, as head coach Rick Carlisle indicated before the All-Star break that he is eager to see what the 3-point specialist can do. McDermott is worth grabbing for help in deeper fantasy formats.

            Harrison Barnes finished Friday's road loss against the Lakers with 19 points, seven rebounds and a blocked shot over 32 minutes.
        
        
             Barnes hit 7-of-16 from the field, including 2-of-4 from behind the 3-point line, while going 3-of-3 from the free-throw line. That part was nice, but he was one of a trio of Mavs starters with a minus-26 rating or worse. He'll look for much better results in Saturday's road game in Salt Lake City against the Jazz. However, he was just 3-of-11 from the field with six points and seven rebounds in the team's last trip to SLC back on Oct. 30.

             This was his third double-double of the season and his fourth career game with at least 16 rebounds -- his career-high is 17 set back in 2010. He's on fire right now and has played 34+ minutes in four straight contests, averaging 18.0 points, 7.8 rebounds, 3.3 assists, 1.0 steals and 2.5 triples in that span. He's worth owning while he's hot, but his minutes could be in jeopardy when Paul Millsap (wrist) returns.

             He was probably going to play a few more minutes, but foul trouble may have changed that. There could be some matchups where Plumlee starts next to Nikola Jokic, but his window for low-end fantasy value could slam shut when Paul Millsap (wrist) returns in March.

             The Joker finished 10-of-16 from the field and 5-of-7 from the line, adding three triples in 34 minutes. Jokic and the Nuggets have now won four straight games and are tied with the Blazers for the No. 6 seed out West. ""I think there's some people that understand what Nikola's doing, what we're doing but overall I think a lot of people, they don't even understand what's going on right now in Denver,"" coach Mike Malone said after the game. Led by Jokic, Gary Harris and Jamal Murray, this team is on the rise and they are only going to become more dangerous with Paul Millsap (wrist) due back soon.

The return of Ricky Rubio dropped him into the 26-29 minute range as figured, so he remains useful in 14-team fantasy formats as long as he can straighten out his shooting woes. He'll look to turn things around Saturday against the Mavericks.

He should have better results Saturday against Dallas against a Mavs scoring defense allowing 104.8 points per game. He might also not have to deal with Dirk Nowitzki (back) down low, so that's a plus.

Nowitzki was getting worked on near the bench and he was displeased before he went to the locker room.

That'll open up run for Dwight Powell, Maxi Kleber and Salah Mejri.

             He's a lock for Sixth Man of the Year at this point and he should probably be unanimous. The Clippers are just 1.0 games behind the Pelicans for the No. 8 spot, but both teams do have a really tough schedule coming up.

            Tobias Harris scored 30 points with 12 rebounds, four assists, one steal, two blocks and five 3-pointers against the Suns on Friday.
        
        
             That's a season-high in boards and just his second double-double. The Suns had no answer for him early as the Clips got out to a 19-0 lead, and the Clippers scored 40 in the first quarter alone. Even before this gem, Harris continues to be a steady hand with his new team, averaging 17.9 points, 6.7 boards, 3.0 assists, 1.4 steals and 1.7 treys. He'll be a mid-round guy going forward.

             Davis hit 3-of-5 from the field, and he also chipped in with a steal, but didn't offer anything else to his fantasy owners. Still, it was an impressive bounce-back performance after going scoreless in his final game prior to the All-Star break. He remains useful only in the deepest of fantasy leagues at this point as long as Jusuf Nurkic remains healthy.

             Lillard was just 7-of-18 from the field, including 2-of-7 from behind the 3-point line, but he ended up a perfect 8-of-8 from the free-throw stripe. He also figured in with four rebounds, three assists and a steal while leading the team with four turnovers. Unlike his teammates, Dame didn't have the luxury of resting, as he was in Los Angeles for the All-Star festivities, but he didn't appears to be too worse for the wear. He is still working on a five-game run with two or more triples, and he has at least one three in 41 consecutive outings dating back to Nov. 7.

             Danny Green sat out after eating some bad spaghetti and Mills made the most of his minutes. He hit 7-of-13 shots and 3-of-4 free throws, adding five assists, four rebounds, one steal and four triples in 33 minutes. Mills was cold coming into tonight's contest with a combined 15 points in his last three games, but he'll be a streaming option on Sunday vs. Cleveland if Green is out again. Manu Ginobili's (chest) status is now in doubt as well.

             Tyrone Wallace continues to outshine some of the veterans  and coach Doc Rivers was OK going small against the Suns. Danilo Gallinari won't be out for long, so leave Wes on the wire.

             The Suns actually made a game out of this after they fell behind 19-0 to start. Going forward, Booker has said he doesn't want to rest and the Suns won't be strategically resting players like last year. Assuming they're both telling the truth, Booker could have a nice second half with a lot of 3-pointers because the Suns will be playing from behind most nights.

             Ginobili had three points, one rebound and one assist in 20 minutes vs. the Nuggets on Friday, but took a shot to the chest and needed X-rays after the game. He was in obvious pain during a post-game interview, but we should get an update on his status at Saturday's practice. Expect to see more of Patty Mills and Bryn Forbes if Ginobili can't go.

             That's a good sign and there are tests doctors can do to see if the ACL was ruptured or not. That said, it's certainly not a guarantee that Butler is OK and there could be other damage to another ligament in his knee. He'll have an MRI on Saturday to confirm the damage. For now, grabbing Nemanja Bjelica in competitive leagues makes sense until we get word.

             The bad news is he went 0-of-7 from the line to tie him for second most attempts without a make in a game this season (Andre Drummond is first with an 0-of-9). The good news is that Len is the last man standing and he should be able to get minutes close to 30 at least until Alan Williams comes back. Maybe he gets hurt again, but it's probably time to pick him up due to the lack of competition and a decent upside.

             It's almost impossible to defend how frequently he's posting duds even with the Suns being shorthanded at center, so he's a fairly easy drop candidate in most leagues. The Suns might be trading him at a serious discount this summer.

             Aminu was a very efficient 5-of-6 from the field, including 2-of-2 from behind the 3-point line, and he added a steal with just one turnover and a solid plus-22 rating. It was Aminu's best point total since Jan. 24 when he went for 15 points. In fact, it was just his second double-double total across the past nine outings. He has decent roto value, especially for his rebounding ability, but he isn't nearly as valuable in points-based leagues.

             He didn't have any formal restrictions despite missing three weeks, but didn't see his usual workload with 26 minutes. He's been working out at full speed for over a week and obviously seemed fine tonight, so it won't be long before he's getting his normal allotment of minutes in the 30s. He'll look to build on this performance on Sunday vs. Denver. When his shot is falling, Ariza is usually an early mid-round fantasy asset.

             Goodness. AD is posting 40-15s like he scoring a tennis match these days with three of those in his last four. His averages over his last four are almost off the charts with 42.3 points, 14.8 boards, 2.0 dimes, 4.0 steals, 3.0 blocks and 2.3 treys on 55.9 percent from the field and 83.7 percent from the line. He's just incredible when he's cruising like this.

             Martin hit 3-of-6 from the field, including a perfect 2-of-2 from behind the 3-point line, and he added four rebounds, two steals and an assist while turning it over just once. He might have played even more if not for five personal fouls, as the bench saw plenty of time with the starters getting their doors blown off early and often.

             He's gone on heaters before and coach Alvin Gentry leaned on him late in this game, including overtime. Clark has seen his minutes climb over his last five games with 26.2 per game, averaging 9.6 points, 2.2 boards, 0.6 steals and 1.4 treys. He's more of a deep-league guy because there aren't enough shots to go around.

             He hit the game-winning bucket and coach Alvin Gentry gets some props for that. Gentry said Jrue was dumping off to Anthony Davis in the final few minutes, and told him the Heat were leaving space to attack the rim. Holiday used that advice and was able to connect for a pull-up. He's having a terrific season.

             Chalmers was a dismal 2-of-10 from the field, including 0-of-2 from behind the 3-point line, and he even misfired on his only free-throw attempt. The only positive from his stat line was his two steals, but his four turnovers nullified even that for most. Still, he might see a bump in run going forward if Tyreke Evans (ribs) is forced to miss time with the injury he suffered on Friday.

However, he could be in line for a bump in playing time and production with Tyreke Evans (ribs) suffering an injury. If Evans is forced to miss time Harrison could see a solid run like he did when the veteran swingman was previously sidelined.

Jimmy Butler left the game with a right knee injury and is set to undergo an MRI on Saturday, and while there is some ""hope"" that it's not too severe, fantasy owners have to prepare for the worst just in case. Wiggins gets a 5.2 usage rate bump with Butler off the floor and carried the Wolves the last time Butler missed four games, scoring an average of 25.8 points in that span including a 40-point outburst.

             There weren't many bright spots for the Grizzlies in the home rout, but Green certainly did his part. He hit 6-of-11 from the field, including 1-of-3 from behind the 3-point line, and he added 2-of-2 from the free-throw stripe. In fact, he posted a plus-14 rating, and was the only member of his team in the positive in plus/minus rating.

             That's an encouraging line for Whiteside and he continues to see big minutes thanks to Kelly Olynyk (shoulder) missing time. That could change when Olynyk comes back, but Whiteside will still be able to do serious damage over the second half with around 24 minutes per game.

             Nance hit 6-of-11 from the field while finishing a perfect 3-of-3 from the charity stripe. He also chipped in with eight rebounds, four steals, two assists and two blocked shots while turning it over just once. He is fitting in rather nicely in his old man's former digs, and this was his most complete game in four outings since coming over from the Los Angeles Lakers.

             He could've had an even bigger night but his shot let him down (5-of-16 FGs). The Wolves may need Crawford to step into a larger role if Jimmy Butler (knee) misses time, but we won't know about the severity until an MRI on Saturday morning. Butler missed four games from Jan. 20 to Jan. 25 and Crawford played in two of those, averaging 20.0 points, 5.0 assists, 1.5 rebounds and 1.0 triples.

             We're running out of nice things to say about J-Rich these days as he matched his career-high in steals. He bas been an absolute monster over his last 40 games, averaging 15.7 points, 3.5 boards, 3.3 assists, 1.5 steals, 1.1 blocks and 2.0 treys on 49.0 percent from the field and 83.0 percent from the line. That makes him a top-20 player in nine-category leagues in that span and he's easily been one of the best value picks even with all the preseason hype. He should've made the All-Star team.

             Osman was a very efficient 4-of-5 from the floor, including 2-of-3 from behind the 3-point arc, while chipping in with three rebounds, an assist, a steal and a blocked shot before being rested for chunks of the second half with his team holding a huge lead on the road. Osman is doing a good job, but the presence of Jordan Clarkson, Jeff Green, Rodney Hood and Larry Nance Jr. makes his fantasy outlook rather murky.

             Hill hit 5-of-11 from the field, and he was 7-of-8 from the free-throw line. Unlike James, however, Hill wasn't able to post a triple-double. In fact, he wasn't even close. He added just two rebounds, one assist and one steal, although his three blocked shots were certainly a nice bump for fantasy owners.

             Clarkson suffered a right eye laceration in the first half and he needed stitches to close a gash. He was able to return and play a good chunk of the fourth quarter with the team well ahead and resting the starting five. It appears Clarkson should be fine for Sunday's nationally-televised game against the Spurs and then beyond.

             Kelly Olynyk (shoulder) still isn't healthy, so Adebayo has been picking up most of the backup center minutes. It will be a lot tougher for him to get minutes close to 20 when Olynyk is back and coach Erik Spoelstra hasn't really kept his word on playing him next to Hassan Whiteside -- partly due to the Olynyk injury. Bam is more of a 14-team guy with a somewhat capped upside.

             He benefitted from Justise Winslow getting two quick fouls against Anthony Davis, so that explains the uptick in run. We've been saying for a month now that Johnson needed the All-Star break more than just about anyone due to his lingering ankle issue, and it's so far, so good with this one. Maybe he's in for another strong finish this season.

            John Collins started at power forward on Friday vs. the Pacers, scoring nine points with nine rebounds and two blocks in 30 minutes.
        
        
             He fumbled some easy rebounds and had some defensive lapses, but the youth movement has begun in Atlanta and we're going to be seeing a lot more of Collins. With Ersan Ilyasova getting bought out, Collins should now see plenty of minutes at both the four and five. He has to be owned in all standard leagues, but he could have some duds because he's prone to foul trouble.

             He didn't touch the floor after halftime but there's no injury to report. It's especially weird that he didn't play since the Hawks were getting crushed on the glass. We're going to see a lot of shady things from the Hawks with their eyes set on the draft lottery, so don't hold onto Dedmon too tightly.

             That's one of the biggest wins of the season for the Bucks to keep them in the No. 6 spot in the standings. The Bucks fighting for playoff positioning should help keep Antetokounmpo on the floor, assuming his knee issue from the summer doesn't continue to hold him out of the occasional back-to-back set.

             Schroder had just nine points on 3-of-12 shots with four turnovers, while Malcolm Delaney (knee) sat this one out. Taylor had 13 points with seven assists, one rebound and one steal in the game before the All-Star break and he's only 23 years old, so the Hawks may give him an extended look down the stretch. The Hawks might rest Dennis Schroder too. If you need a PG, Taylor is worth a look in deeper leagues.

             He played much better than expected and his play kept Tyler Zeller on the bench for the whole game. Henson was starting to fade before his hamstring injury and he's been inconsistent, but he's worth a look if you need some blocks.

             This comes after just a nine-minute game in the last outing, so this was a big surprise. Terry knocked down two clutch free throws with 0.4 seconds left in OT to help earn this win. Leave him on the wire unless you're in a super deep league.

He also posted five rebounds, five assists and a steal with a strong plus-18 rating. Lamb remains a decent play for those in deepest formats.

             That'll snap their six-game winning streak and give them just a 1.0-game lead over the Celtics. DeRozan was in a mild slump before this game and only averaged 19.1 points per game in his previous February outings. He'll likely be scoring in the 23-26 point range in the second half, but the big difference from DeRozan this year is his well-rounded stat lines.

The Raptors are too deep right now, so it may be tough for most of their second unit to hold consistent value in 12-team leagues.

             OPJ was a very effective 7-of-12 from the field, including 2-of-5 from behind the 3-point line, while adding six rebounds and four assists with no turnovers. He is riding high, posting double-digit fantasy totals in 12 straight outings, just two games shy of a career-high 14-game run of 10 or more points from March 12-April 6, 2016. Porter is averaging 17.8 PPG, 6.7 RPG, 3.3 APG and 1.3 SPG during the impressive 12-game run.

             He took some contact and he was grabbing his right side in pain as he went to the locker room. The team ruled him out about four minutes later in real time, but it is garbage time right now. Considering where the Grizzlies are in the standings, Evans could miss time, which would open up more run for Andrew Harrison. If you wanted to speculatively add Harrison, it's not a bad idea.

             Beal was a solid 11-of-21 from the field, including 3-of-6 from behind the 3-point line, and he was a solid 8-of-9 from the free-throw stripe, too. He has been hot over the past three outings, averaging 29.0 PPG, 4.0 APG, 2.8 RPG, 1.0 RPG and 3.0 3-pointers per game. The Wizards fell short in this one, ending a four-game winning streak, but Beal is a major reason the team remains one of the best teams in the Eastern Conference despite the fact John Wall (knee) remains on the shelf.

GRIII will be in the rotation going forward, but he'll be the fourth wing option behind Victor Oladipo, Bojan Bogdanovic and Lance Stephenson. He's not on the radar in most leagues, but it's good to see him back after a lengthy absence.

             Kaminsky hit 9-of-16 from the field while going a red-hot 6-of-9 from behind the 3-point line. He also added three assists, three rebounds and a blocked shot. It was a big turnaround for the former Wisconsin Badgers standout, as he limped out of the second-half gates with just four points on 1-of-5 shooting Thursday against Brooklyn. As long as Dwight Howard and Marvin Williams remain healthy the fantasy ceiling is rather limited for Kaminsky. Consider this performance an anomaly.

             Coach Nate McMillan isn't afraid to ride the hot hand and Sabonis had it tonight. As for Myles Turner, he was pretty quiet with seven points, eight rebounds and two assists in 22 minutes. Sabonis hit 9-of-13 shots and helped the Pacers out-rebound the Hawks 57-40. He's not the most reliable big, especially when Turner is healthy, but Sabonis is still doing enough to warrant ownership in standard leagues. We just wish he produced more defensive stats.

He needed help off the floor and he didn't put weight on his right leg, so this does not look good at all.

            Victor Oladipo flirted with a triple-double in Friday's easy 116-93 win over the Hawks, scoring 14 points with nine assists, seven rebounds, four steals, two blocks and two triples.
        
        
             He only played 28 minutes, so he was well on pace for his first triple-double as a Pacer if not for garbage time. Dipo only had four points at halftime and hit just 5-of-16 shots, but showed why he's so valuable in fantasy for his multi-category production. This was his fourth game of the season with at least two steals, two blocks and two triples and he could easily hold onto his first-round ranking in standard leagues the rest of the way.

             He did lose some minutes to Terry Rozier down the stretch and it's probably a fair bet to say Brown may have a tough time sustaining his 31.6 minutes per game. He should still be able to flirt with 30 minutes, but Brown can be considered as a drop in shallower leagues now that his ceiling and floor have lowered.

             Somewhat surprisingly, it was Tatum who took a hit with playing time with Marcus Smart coming back, but Tatum did close this game before it got to garbage time. He has cooled off a tad from his tremendous start, but he's still a must-start plaery in 12-team leagues.

             He was awesome the first half, so coach Brad Stevens rolled the Theis out there to start the third because Aron Baynes got hurt. It's unknown if Aron Baynes' elbow injury is bad, but the team did originally say he was available to return before later ruling him out. He's not really an add unless we get more news on Baynes, and for now it sounds like Baynes' injury is more of a day-to-day issue.

             It was one of his better games on offense and he brought it on defense as per usual. Maybe Smart's incident with a picture frame gave him a little extra edge, but it's not like effort was a problem with him anyway. He'll still likely be a guy that should be used on teams punting FG%, but the counting stats will be there with minutes closer to 30.

             His minutes were going to take a hit here, but the Celtics second unit got hot early in the fourth to get this game to garbage time. If not for the blowout and also Aron Baynes getting hurt to make the Celtics smaller, Rozier likely would've been closer to 20 minutes. He's more of a low-upside hold in deeper leagues and it didn't help that Marcus Smart played well today.

             The Celtics did a fine job of neutralizing Drummond from getting the ball down low while they kept Blake away from the hoop, as well. Griffin finished with 17 points, four rebounds, one steal, six turnovers and two 3-pointers over his 35 minutes. The Pistons are now 2.0 games behind the Heat at the completion of their game, so they could be 2.5 back with a Miami win in New Orleans. They have some work to do.

We should see Royce O'Neale, Jae Crowder and some other bench guys take a hit here.

            Aron Baynes (left elbow) will not return against the Pistons on Friday.
        
        
             The team originally called him available to return from his left elbow injury, but apparently the injury was worse than originally thought. Daniel Theis has been tearing it up in the first half, so coach Brad Stevens may just go with him even more after halftime. He's not really a strong pickup unless he was already on your radar before today.

             He reportedly had bad spaghetti to cause food poisoning, so this makes it the second noteworthy food issue for the Spurs -- Kawhi Leonard was sick from a Philly cheesesteak years ago. With him out, it'll be a team effort from the guards with Bryn Forbes, Patty Mills, Derrick White and Manu Ginobili playing more.

             This means Davis Bertans will head back to the bench. Gasol averages 25.2 minutes as a starter compared to 18.0 minutes as a reserve, so his fantasy owners will be hoping this move sticks.

            Eric Gordon (illness) is not at the arena yet and could miss Friday's game against the Wolves.
        
        
             It sounds like he's not going to play, but of course that could change shortly. If he's out, Gerald Green, P.J. Tucker and Luc Mbah a Moute could help out with Trevor Ariza also back in the lineup.

             The Rockets will go with a starting lineup of Chris Paul, James Harden, Ariza, P.J. Tucker and Clint Capela, so Luc Mbah a Moute will shift to the bench. Ariza has been working out at full speed for over a week, so it will be interesting to see how many minutes he can handle tonight. Gerald Green could remain in the rotation tonight with Eric Gordon (illness) not feeling well.

Ilyasova is a drop candidate in most leagues.

             This comes as a big surprise after Ilyasova said he didn't want to have to relocate. It's unclear what Ilyasova's next move is, but he would still have time to join a contender to be on a playoff roster. This move is big news for John Collins, and it should get more minutes to DeAndre Bembry, Mike Muscala and maybe even Andrew White III.

             He did say he'll ""probably"" be ready for the road tip that starts on Monday at Madison Square Garden. The Warriors moving Zaza Pachulia out of the starting lineup is good news for Bell, and coach Steve Kerr said that Bell should be in the rotation upon his return. Considering his upside, it's not a bad idea to stash him in deeper leagues, assuming you can wait about a week before he's close to 100 percent.

             He suffered a hand injury last night and the training staff got a look at him, but X-rays were negative. It's being called a right hand contusion, so there's a chance this injury could interfere with the right-handed forward's shot. If he's out, that means we'll see a lot of small-ball lineups with more Austin Rivers, Tyrone Wallace and Wes Johnson.

             Coach Luke Walton said he's still not sure if Ball is going to start, but the Lakers have been vocal about him being their starting point guard. He's been out for 41 days with this MCL sprain and it could be a while before he's back up to minutes in the upper 30s. His return should take time from Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, Josh Hart, Corey Brewer, and maybe some of the forwards with the Lakers going smaller at the three.

             He didn't say anything specific, but he mentioned maybe 15-20 minutes. Pop also said Gay makes him nervous, but he looked good in practice the last two days and everything seems to be going well. Gay is probably going to have a minutes limit on him for the rest of this month, but he's still worth a look in 12-team leagues. There's a chance he starts, too.

            Coach Gregg Popovich said he'll be changing the starting lineup against the Nuggets on Friday.
        
        
             ""We'll tell you later,"" he said when asked what the starting five will be. LaMarcus Aldridge didn't play in the last game, so it could be something as simple as that with him returning. Davis Bertans could also be moved out for either Pau Gasol or the Spurs could go smaller with Kyle Anderson and Rudy Gay at the forwards.

             The Mavs have said they're hoping to get Noel back, but he doesn't have a target date to return. Besides coach Rick Carlisle saying Noel could be back soon, there hasn't been too much optimism around this situation. Most fantasy owners can leave him on the wire until he has a target date.

             Zeller gave the Bucks some solid production off the bench in Milwaukee's final two games prior to the All-Star break, scoring 14 points in back-to-back contests. However, John Henson (hamstring) was sidelined for those two games, and is expected to return Friday night. Thus, Zeller will see his playing time diminished.

Royce O'Neale played well in Rubio's absence but will see his minutes dip with Ricky back in the mix.

             Larkin has missed nearly a month of action, with his last game appearance coming back on Jan. 27. However, Larkin was able to practice with the team on Thursday, indicating he is inching closer to a return.

             Smart missed the final 11 games before the All-Star break due to a hand injury. He's been cleared to return from that ailment; however, he sat out Thursday's practice due to a thigh bruise. Yet, the bruise is considered minor and we should see Smart make his return to action on Friday night. Terry Rozier will see his playing time reduced with Smart back in the lineup.

             Larkin has not played in a game since January 27th, but was able to return to full practice on Thursday and appears to be making solid progress. However, Marcus Smart (hand) is expected to return to the lineup on Friday, which means Larkin will only see limited minutes off the bench even when he is fully healthy.

McGee finished with six points, four rebounds and one steal over 14 minutes in the win over the Clippers. Zaza had six points in seven minutes off the bench. It's safe to assume we'll see a similar allotment of minutes on Saturday night.

We may not get an update until Friday afternoon. If Gallinari is unable to play, Tyrone Wallace and Wes Johnson would soak up additional minutes.

             As per usual, Jordan did an excellent job on the glass, creating numerous second-chance opportunities for the Clippers, and as an added bonus he finished 6-of-6 from the charity stripe. Tobias Harris was also solid, finishing with 22 points, two triples, six boards, five assists, one steal and three turnovers across 36 minutes, but ultimately, it was not enough to pull out a win over the Warriors.

             Gallinari fell victim to some suffocating defense from both Kevin Durant and Draymond Green in this one, and he was also seen being tended to by the Clippers’ trainer on the bench towards the end of the game. He didn’t appear to suffer an obvious injury while he was out there, but it also doesn’t take much to force The Rooster to the sidelines, and with the Clippers on a back-to-back, we’re going to have to consider him questionable for Friday’s game vs. Phoenix.

             Rivers did help the Clippers go on a few runs to help keep the game competitive, and he should be looking at some increased opportunity while Avery Bradley (hernia) is out. Unfortunately, he also went just 2-of-6 from the charity stripe, and poor free throw shooting has been a major issue for him this season. He's a more attractive guy to own for those employing a free throw punting strategy.

             Head coach Steve Kerr said his coaching staff crunched some numbers over the All-Star break and found that they were consistently getting off to bad starts with Zaza Pachulia as their starting five-man, so he switched things up by throwing McGee out there, and confirmed after the game that the trend would continue on Saturday against the Thunder. However, even as a starter, McGee is unlikely to get the sort of minutes he needs to churn out value in most leagues.

            Klay Thompson scored 19 points on 8-of-14 shooting Thursday, to go with two 3-pointers, two rebounds, one assist, one block and two turnovers in 36 minutes.
        
        
             Thompson was red hot to start the game, not missing his first shot until late in the second quarter, and he also became the 10th player in Dubs’ history to score 10,000 points in a Warriors’ uniform. Klay essentially roasted anyone who was in front of him, but the hot shooting was also a team-wide trend, as Golden State only missed 11 shots through the first half of action and they hit 62.6% of their shot attempts when all was said and done.

             The Dubs got off to an incredible start in this one, and Curry had his #StephGonSteph moment early, draining a halfcourt shot at the buzzer to end the first quarter of action. He was also a perfect 8-of-8 from the charity stripe, giving him a remarkable 94.2 true shooting percentage on the evening to accompany his 33.1 usage rate, and it looks like Steph has a decent chance of putting together yet another 50-40-90 season.

             He was open for a 3-pointer near the top of the key for one of the flattest triples you'll see this season, but it still counts for three. Before the game-winner, this was the 33rd time he's posted a triple-double before the fourth quarter in his career, and he had plenty of time to spare with it coming at the 7:04 mark in third quarter. Westbrook is up to 97 career triple-doubles and he'll likely be at 100 in the next couple weeks. He's not going to have the historic year like his MVP 2016-17 campaign, but Westbrook has been better after a slow start a couple months ago.

             Even with the OKC first unit scoring a bunch in the first quarter, Huestis was not really involved in the offense. Even if he does continue to start, he's not going to produce enough stats to be worthy of a scoop in most fantasy leagues.

             He came off the bench with coach Billy Donovan going with Josh Huestis to start. Donovan has talked about how he likes consistency in his second unit, so maybe this lineup sticks.

             He actually looked healthy this time, which is encouraging because he was laboring through his shoulder injury for multiple weeks before he was finally shut down on Feb. 1. Labissiere is still going to have his ups and downs, and you never really know what coach Dave Joerger has lined up for his rotation. We'd like to see him play better next time, but for now he's more of a 16-team add.

De'Aaron Fox won't be out for long with his pink eye issue, but it's possible Mason takes minutes from Garrett Temple.

             He did most of his damage in the first quarter as the Thunder got out to a huge 44-21 lead after one. However, OKC scored just 41 points in the second and third quarter to eventually blow that lead in the third quarter. George was on a tear to start the month with 29.6 points per game in his previous February outings, so he's set up for a monster finish.

             Starting PG George Hill logged 31 minutes tonight and Clarkson was strictly deployed as his backup, which isn't what fantasy owners want to see. If he doesn't earn minutes at SG it will be hard to justify holding him in 12-team leagues, but a bit of patience is warranted as coach Ty Lue sorts out his rotations. We'll keep a close eye on Clarkson's minutes during games this Friday (at Memphis) and Sunday (vs. San Antonio).

Cavs coach Tyronn Lue went with a true 10-man rotation tonight, and Hood was the only bench player to log more than 19 minutes. He's not a particularly well-rounded fantasy option, but has been active enough offensively with the Cavs to hold in most fantasy scenarios.

            George Hill played 31 minutes on Thursday but couldn't get it going offensively, scoring six points on 2-of-10 shooting with an 0-of-4 mark from downtown.
        
        
             Hill added three rebounds, three assists and one steal, while committing three turnovers. The minutes were solid and Hill has a respectable 20.9 usage rate in Cleveland, but he's erasing his fantasy value with awful shooting and nearly as many turnovers (2.0) as assists (2.7). He should improve as he gains familiarity with his new teammates.

             LBJ sank 13-of-18 field goals tonight, with one 3-pointer, but that was the extent of the Cavs' offensive efficiency -- his teammates shot a combined 29-of-66 from the field (43.9%). Cleveland's revamped lineup had won five straight prior to this loss, but the No. 3 seed Cavs are still just 2.5 games ahead of the No. 6 seed Bucks. With home-court advantage in the playoffs at stake, LeBron's fantasy value looks rock-solid.

             Frazier wore a face mask after missing some time before the break with a nasal fracture. The mask didn't seem to impact his play, but even without John Wall (knee), Frazier's fantasy value is very limited due to Tomas Satoransky thriving in the starting role. Leave him on the wire.

             The veteran didn't have any assists, steals or blocks, and he was outplayed by backup center Ian Mahinmi (eight points, five rebounds, two assists, one steal in 20 minutes). Gortat hasn't scored more than 11 points in a game since Jan. 13 and his owners should be inured to random duds -- if you've held him this long, you might as well see how he fares on Friday (vs. Charlotte) and Sunday (vs. Philly).

             The All-Star break appears to have rejuvenated Oubre, who logged 32 minutes, and he's worth a look if you need scoring, 3-pointers and FT percentage. He's available on most waiver wires in category-based leagues because of his atrocious slump prior to the break -- in his previous eight games, Oubre averaged 9.0 points on 28.6% shooting. That was among the most poisonous FG% in that stretch, alongside guys like Isaiah Thomas, Dennis Smith Jr. and Aaron Gordon.

             Smith has battled a few ailments this season and he missed time before the break with an illness. He's healthy now and his exclusion from the rotation was simply due to coach Scott Brooks' rotations, so we're taking him off the injury report.

             The 26-year-old guard added eight assists, four rebounds, two steals and one 3-pointer without a single turnover. John Wall (knee surgery) recently got off crutches but he's unlikely to return before mid- to late-March, giving Satoransky at least a few weeks of unfettered minutes as the Wizards' starting PG. He's quietly emerged as one of the best waiver-wire additions this season, with past-month averages of 10.5 points (55.7% FGs, 100.0% FTs), 1.4 triples, 2.9 rebounds, 5.4 assists, 1.3 steals and 0.6 blocks.

             Hello, Mr. Process. This was about as close to a 5x5 as he's been in his career. Embiid's minutes were starting to trend down earlier this month at just 29.7 in his previous February games, so getting up to 35 makes it seem like he could be closer to the 32.5 per game he played back in January. The 76ers are rolling with a six-game winning streak and they now have a 98 percent chance to make the playoffs, per FiveThirtyEight.com. The 76ers also have one of the easiest remaining schedules in the NBA, so playoff fever in Philly looks like it'll go beyond February.

             He was very good from the field at 13-of-18, but he did make just 6-of-11 from the line. His free throw shooting has been an Achilles heel, but he knocked down two huge ones with six seconds left to help the 76ers earn their sixth straight win. Plus, coach Fred Hoiberg said the Bulls wanted to foul Simmons on the previous possession, but the 76ers got the ball to J.J. Redick, who made both with eight second left. Simmons and Joel Embiid play very well off each other and the sky is the limit with this duo.

He still continues to see minutes in the 30s most nights because of his defense, but it'll be interesting to see what happens when the 76ers have to play from behind because Marco Belinelli could steal run. Regardless, RoCo still has to be owned in all leagues.

             Those 3-pointers were a career-high and he only turned the ball over one time while taking a whopping 26 shots from the field. Portis is likely going to stay on the bench for the foreseeable future, but that's OK as this gem ranks second for points off the bench in a single game behind 6MOY favorite Lou Williams (40, twice).

            David Nwaba scored a career-high 21 points during a start with nine rebounds, two assists, one steal, one block, three 3-pointers and six fouls in 33 minutes against the 76ers on Thursday.
        
        
             Not a bad line before fouling out. Nwaba also played his usual hard-nosed defense and he helped set the tempo for the Bulls in transition. We've seen him heat up before and coach Fred Hoiberg trusts him against top-notch perimeter players, so the minutes should be there for him. We don't know if Justin Holiday is going to be a DNP-CD the rest of the way, so Nwaba is more of a look in standard leagues.

             The minutes are probably going to be there for Vonleh and the Bulls second unit was effective. Even if Robin Lopez continues to sit, Vonleh is still likely going to be the fourth big man in this rotation, so he won't offer enough upside.

             Coach Fred Hoiberg said he wanted to see Felicio make simple plays and run the floor, and he came through in that regard. Of course, the star of the show was Bobby Portis, who played mostly center in this close game. Felicio will likely only have deep-league value.

             Before the game started, coach Fred Hoiberg said he considered Valentine a new potential leader for the Bulls in the second half of the season. Although, his mistakes late were brutal and that could be a factor for Hoiberg the next time he has to make a lineup call in the fourth quarter. That aside, Valentine did close this game out and he could see even more run with Paul Zipser (foot) getting hurt. He's worth a look in 12-team leagues, but for now David Nwaba looks like the hotter pickup.

             New York is predictably emphasizing youth as they drift toward the end of the regular season with a 23-36 record. He's worth grabbing if you need a cheap PG, especially in points leagues, but be mindful of his limitations in category-based formats -- he has career averages of 37.4% FGs and 73.3% FTs, with 2.5 turnovers and 4.3 assists, and he's a combined 0-of-10 from deep in four games with the Knicks.

             Knicks coach Jeff Hornacek said repeatedly that he planned to use his young guards more after the All-Star break. Jack is 34 years old on a team headed for the draft lottery, so this shouldn't have taken any fantasy owners by surprise. Send him to the waiver wire, if he's not there already.

             It looks like Jarrett Jack might be out of the rotation for good, which leaves Burke, Emmanuel Mudiay, Frank Ntilikina and Courtney Lee to handle the backcourt. Mudiay played 23 minutes as a starter tonight, while Ntilikina logged 30 minutes, and the most encouraging sign is that New York went with a lot of two-PG lineups. This will likely be the high-water mark for his fantasy value all season, and we're not overreacting to one big game vs. a poor Magic defense, but deep-league owners can consider him as a speculative add.

             O'Quinn had great energy in his first game back from the All-Star break, and for now it seems New York will stick with the 27-year-old as the primary backup for Enes Kanter. His case for minutes was also aided by a poor showing from Luke Kornet, who went scoreless on 0-of-5 shooting. Even if he does avoid a shutdown, though, O'Quinn isn't worth owning in most leagues.

             Lee added two assists, one rebound and one steal without any turnovers, but this wasn't the post-break performance owners wanted to see. Trey Burke caught fire with 26 points off the bench and the Knicks went with a lot of two-PG lineups, which ate into Lee's role. It's not a great spot for him as a veteran on a bad team, but he should still play a bigger role most nights.

             Gordon played 25 minutes and might be limited for a few more games, but it's encouraging that the All-Star break was enough for him to fully recover. He bumped Mario Hezonja to the bench and should reclaim his usual 32+ minutes before long. Now owners just have to hope he regains his shooting touch -- his FG percentage has dropped every month this season, to a low of 35.4% in January.

             He had his double-double in the first half to get him to his fifth-ranked 37th double-double on the season. The Hornets have said they may try to reassess their rotation in early March, but they're only 5.0 games back from the No. 8 spot. Fantasy owners of Hornets players will be rooting for them to add on to their two-game winning streak.

             Coach Steve Clifford did use Michael Carter-Williams as a secondary ball-handler, so maybe the Hornets are slightly trying to dial back Walker's workload. Either way, he's a capable off-ball player, he did get to 35 minutes and he'll be a fantasy stud as long as he's in the lineup.

            Bismack Biyombo shifted to the bench on Thursday and had two points, five rebounds and two blocks in 20 minutes, going 0-of-4 from the field and 2-of-4 from the line.
        
        
             Biyombo had some nice stretches as a fill-in starter while Nikola Vucevic (hand) was out, but his averages over the past 10 games were lackluster -- 8.2 points, 6.3 rebounds, 1.2 assists, 0.9 blocks and 0.6 steals. Vuc returned to the starting lineup tonight, and Orlando reportedly hopes to find minutes for Khem Birch in the center rotation, which makes Biyombo expendable outside of very deep leagues.

            Jonathon Simmons rolled his right ankle on Thursday, but he returned to finish with 12 points (5-of-10 FGs, 2-of-4 FTs), five assists and four rebounds in 30 minutes.
        
        
             Simmons' ankle has been a nagging issue since Feb. 6, so it's discouraging to see him aggravate the injury in the first game after the break. He's as tough as they come and did return after spending some time in the locker room, fortunately, but as a precaution we'll list him as questionable for Saturday's road game. Mario Hezonja and Wesley Iwundu stand to gain the most if Simmons misses any time.

             His playing time took a big hit on Feb. 14 and it may have been because of his defense against the Magic. Kaminsky really needs a lot of volume to have value in fantasy leagues, so he's not really worth adding while Dwight Howard and Marvin Williams are active.

             Besides Russell trying to make plays that weren't there, it was about all you could ask in his first game after the break. He was very aggressive -- almost to a fault -- and he was able to drive past defenders throughout the game. Russell's minutes limit looks to be basically gone right now, but he still really needs to lock in to keep his mistakes down. He'll have a decent ceiling most nights.

             In an interesting twist, Wallace had to fly to San Francisco today and missed shootaround because of car service mixup. He should still be in the rotatoin and get minutes in the teens. He won't have much value in fantasy off the bench.

             Avery Bradley (athletic pubalgia) is unavailable, so Teodosic will start alongside Austin Rivers in the backcourt. Anyone holding onto him might as well get him in their active lineups, and we're expecting Steph Curry to have a field day offensively.

            Dante Cunningham went off in the second unit with a season-high 22 points, adding 12 rebounds, four assists, one block and four 3-pointers in 27 minutes against the Hornets on Thursday.
        
        
             That scoring output doubled his previous best this season and it was his first double-double of the year, too. Cunningham is best known in fantasy for taking minutes away from younger prospects and it's certainly possible he'll do that in Brooklyn. Rondae Hollis-Jefferson has a good chance to play on Monday, so that would likely affect Cunningham's playing time more than anyone else. If you wanted to add him in a deep league, hopefully you're not dropping anything another owner may want.

             He picked up two quick fouls in the first quarter, but coach Kenny Atkinson kept him in and he didn't pick up his third until the fourth -- it was a loose-ball foul, too. He did have some trouble against Dwight Howard in the early going, but overall it wasn't a bad showing for Allen. The Nets should continue to play him minutes in the upper 20s and he should be owned in all leagues.

             The Thunder go with a lengthly lineup here, but this could have a little to do with Alex Abrines' hip injury from last week. Huestis likely won't be getting many shots and he's probably looking at around 20-24 minutes, so he's not going to have much fantasy value. There's a chance this lineup could stick, though.

             There was a decent chance he was going to be a DNP-CD anyway because of Skal Labissiere expected to be back. Koufos and Zach Randolph will likely sit out games to finish the year as the Kings try to develop their younger players. This is generally a situation to avoid in most leagues until Skal can show he's capable of producing.

             Well, that's a move for the defending champs. They did not have a strong finish to their first half and maybe this is a way coach Steve Kerr looks to get his team going to finish up their regular season. McGee likely won't play more than 15 minutes, so he's not really worth adding unless you're in a deep league.

             It's being called right ankle tendinitis and Chalmers was not on the injury report for this issue as the first half ended. Chalmers had a hamstring and a shoulder issue bother him leading to the break, so again this is something new. If he's out, that means more run for Andrew Harrison.

Parsons' absence is not related to his knee and perhaps he can return for the second half of a back-to-back set on Saturday. He doesn't have fantasy value in almost all leagues.

David Nwaba, Denzel Valentine and Zach LaVine should soak up more minutes on the wings tonight and going forward.

            Kent Bazemore is not on the injury report for Friday against the Pacers.
        
        
             The Hawks are expected to play their veterans in the second half, but there's a very good chance that plan changes. Bazemore did not play on Feb. 14 due to rest, so he's likely got a couple more of those coming the rest of the way. He's still worth owning in standard leagues.

             He was a surprise DNP-back on Wednesday and there's a good chance Schroder gets a few more games off in the second half, especially in a back-to-back set. For now, fire him up in all leagues while he's active.

             A lot of people are sick these days and hopefully Zeller is almost over his illness. It could be a three-way split at center for the Bucks, so it may be hard to own someone like Zeller in most leagues.

             The Kings opt to rule him out early and chances are he won't be at the arena tonight. With him out, Frank Mason should get a decent chance in his return to the lineup while Garrett Temple, Bogdan Bogdanovic and Buddy Hield could help out. Fox should get big minutes once he's healthy.RotoGrinders.com Daily Slant: With Fox and all inactive/non-rotation members off the floor, Garrett Temple actually gets the biggest bump in FPPM (fantasy points per minute) with a +0.08 increase while also picking up +1.6% in usage rate. Frank Mason's per-minute production doesn't change much, but the increased court time is where his appeal ties in. Temple is the contrarian target on this side, with Mason also having appeal as a potential starter.

             That's good news after Rubio did not practice on Wednesday. Rubio missed the last three games of the first half, which allowed Royce O'Neale to thrive in the starting lineup. Even if Rubio returns, O'Neale still has a chance to produce useable value in 12-team leagues. Rubio was also red hot before his injury on Feb. 9.

             He is still likely to play on Friday and hopefully he's not contagious anymore. Barton could be limited on Friday and hopefully we get an update on his status at shootaround on Friday morning.

             He's not going to be available tonight and the Wizards won't really need him with Tim Frazier expected to be the backup, but Sessions should be available for Friday. Sessions played 82 games with the Wizards back in the 2015-16 season and spent part of the 2014-15 year with them, too. He won't have fantasy value.

             Coach J.B. Bickerstaff did say that Parsons' absence isn't related to his knee. Parsons made his return to the lineup on Feb. 14 before the break, but the Grizzlies will almost certainly be giving him days off. They start with a back-to-back on Friday and Saturday. Leave him on the wire.

             It'll be interesting to see what the Lakers do with their backcourt, but they have made it very clear Ball is the starting point guard. Ball has been out since Jan. 13 due to an MCL sprain, but the injury was never considered serious. He was also playing fairly well before his injury, so it's possible he's in for a nice finish as the team's top guard.

             He is not practicing today and there's a very good chance he's going to miss time with this injury. Chandler missed Wednesday's game before the break last week and apparently the week off didn't help too much. Of course, the Suns have said they don't plan to rest guys, but they'll likely be very, very careful with putting Chandler on the court. Alex Len could be in a decent spot to produce, but he really needs to show he can stay on the floor for over a week with decent minutes.

             This is an issue that could linger for the remainder of the season and coach Doc Rivers called him 50/50 for each game going forward. He wasn't worth owning before the injury, so his fantasy owners should look elsewhere for value. Austin Rivers and Milos Teodosic should pick up some of the slack, but this is Lou Williams' offense. Tyrone Wallace will start in Bradley's place and could have some deep-league appeal, but there should be better options on your wire.

            Hornets coach Steve Clifford said Cody Zeller doesn't have any minute restrictions moving forward.
        
        
             ""He’s trying to get back into rhythm,"" Clifford said of Zeller. ""He’s so smart, and such a good natural athlete, I think guys like him can get there quicker."" Dwight Howard is still kicking, so even though Zeller doesn't have restrictions it doesn't mean he's going to see minutes in the 20s consistently. He's a deep-league asset for now.

And again, this is going to be a great last 23 games for him because, we’ll see, can he play the 30 minutes without his knees hurting? Part of that is growth."" It sounds like he may eventually start next to Emmanuel Mudiay, but it's obvious that the Knicks want to get him more run. He hasn't been playing well on the offensive end, so most fantasy owners can just watch his progress from the wire.

With the Knicks hoping to also look at Frank Ntilikina and Trey Burke, there's a good chance that Jack will be a healthy scratch tonight.

             Fox suffered a cut above his right eye during the Kings' final game before the All-Star break, but he logged 16 minutes during the Rising Stars game and this case of pink eye appears to be totally unrelated. Frank Mason (foot) is iffy to play, so if Fox can't suit up the Kings will likely turn to Garrett Temple for the bulk of the PG minutes.

             It's unclear why either player was away from the team. There's no reason to think it will prevent them from playing in the Grizzlies' first game after the break, as they host the Cavs on Friday, so Evans' owners can tentatively keep him locked into active lineups.

             According to beat writer Matt Velazquez, Dellavedova had ""[a] little bit of movement heading into each shot ... Looking confident, comfortable on his sprained ankle."" Malcolm Brogdon (quad) isn't expected back until late March or early April, so the Bucks would get a big lift if Dellavedova can return later this month. Leave him on the waiver wire outside of the deepest leagues.

             Gregg Popovich said on Wednesday that he'd be ""surprised"" if Leonard returned this season, although it's unclear if that includes the postseason. ""We only have X number of games left in the season, and he's still not ready to go,"" Popovich said. ""If by some chance he is [ready to play], it's gonna be pretty late into the season ... I'll be surprised if he gets back this year."" The revelation that Kawhi has been medically cleared adds to the confusion surrounding his ailment, and he could reportedly play if ""he can manage the pain of the injury."" Most fantasy owners should already be resigned to a lost season.

             Bradley's injury is usually lumped into the catch-all phrase 'sports hernia', but specifically refers to ""the disruption and/or separation of the more medial common aponeurosis from the pubis, usually with some degree of adductor tendon pathology."" Clippers coach Doc Rivers suggested that Bradley's status for each game will be a toss-up depending upon how he feels, and this should be the last straw for most fantasy owners. Whenever he does miss games, Austin Rivers and Lou Williams should be ready to pick up the slack.

             The Nuggets expect more clarity after Millsap visits doctors next week. He went through parts of practice on Wednesday and a return in early- or mid-March sounds plausible, so make sure he's not still floating on your waiver wire. Malone suggested that Millsap might come off the bench initially, as he works himself back into game shape, but it shouldn't take long before he's starting alongside Nikola Jokic.

             This is worrisome news for Rubio's fantasy owners. He was surging before getting hurt on Feb. 9 and we were optimistic that he'd be ready after the break, but he's still receiving treatment on his hip. Owners should make contingency plans for the weekend, but for now we're calling him questionable for games on Friday (vs. Portland) and Saturday (vs. Dallas). If he can't suit up, Donovan Mitchell will have the ball in his hands more often than not, while Royce O'Neale and Joe Ingles also stand to benefit.

             Not good. It's unclear if Pop means just the regular season or for the playoffs, as well. The Spurs have not been very forthcoming with updates on Leonard, and there's been no talk of him progressing in his rehab. The Spurs will be giving a longer look at Dejounte Murray as a starter and now Kyle Anderson should be starting for the foreseeable future. Leonard's fantasy owners may want to consider dropping him in what has been a lost season.

             It sounds like they both are going to play on Thursday, but Gordon also hinted he may have a minutes limit. ""It’s going to take some time getting rhythm back, [getting] the feel back,"" Gordon said. ""The first day, it’s almost like fool’s gold. You get so excited to come back and play that it takes over. It’s that second and third day that everything kind of sets in. You get a little sore."" It's great news that Gordon will be back soon, but it may be a few games before he's back to producing must-start value in shallow leagues.

""I think we’ve been a mix of young and veteran guys all year,"" he said Wednesday.

             He's been working out full speed for at least a week, so he should be ready to roll for Friday night and may not even have restrictions. Ariza suffered his injury on Jan. 28, so he's had three weeks to recover. His return means Luc Mbah a Moute, P.J. Tucker and Gerald Green will lose minutes. Ariza should be owned in all leagues.

McGruder had surgery on his leg for a stress reaction back in October and he's yet to make his season debut. He had a chance to be the opening-night starter, so McGruder could find himself back in the rotation. He likely won't have fantasy value, though.

             ""He did some non-contact work [Wednesday], a ton of conditioning, but not the contact part of practice,"" said coach Erik Spoelstra. That means the All-Star break likely wasn't enough for Olynyk's shoulder to get right after the injury on Feb. 5. Olynyk played a whopping 40 minutes in the game prior to injury, and he had been taking minutes away from Hassan Whiteside. Olynyk being out would open up a few extra minutes for Whiteside, James Johnson and Bam Adebayo.

Jackson was expected to miss 6-8 back on Dec. 27, so it sounds like he'll be closer to eight weeks. While he's out, Ish Smith will get most of the minutes with Jameer Nelson likely to help out in the second unit.

""I’m not going to take it for granted,"" Mudiay said. ""I came in as a lottery pick so I was kind of handed the spot and stuff like that. So the fact that I’m in that position again, it’s a blessing."" The Knicks have played Mudiay next to Frank Ntilikina a bunch this month, and that should still continue. Mudiay isn't the most efficient player, but he should have opportunity to post numbers. If you're OK with bad percentages, Mudiay is worth a look in standard leagues.

             Collison is currently at the two-week mark of his initial 2-3 week timetable, so maybe he'll be able to get back to the court sometime next week. With him out, Cory Joseph will continue to start at the one, with Joe Young acting as his primary backup, but those guys have been too inconsistent to be trusted in most 12-team leagues. Collison is worth stashing just about everywhere.

             Russell has eclipsed the 30-minute mark just once since coming back from what was a relatively minor knee procedure, but he should be better over this second half of the season. Atkinson has hinted that he'll eventually move Russell back into the starting five, which would likely shift Allen Crabbe back to the second unit.

LeVert belongs on the waiver wire in most leagues.

             ""Perspective is a blessing. My time in the G League was all about perspective,"" Okafor said. ""I gained a greater appreciation for the grind."" Okafor has earned a couple starts in New Orleans, but he's still not a lock to be on the squad for the remainder of the season as he's just on a 10-day deal. It's nice to see him back in the NBA following a five-year absence, but he's a non-factor in most leagues.

With the regulars expected to be back in action on Friday, it'll be tough for White to have a repeat performance.

""They just had to make sure he was OK,"" Hornets coach Steve Clifford said. ""He wasn’t able to practice today, but he says he feels better. He’s just stiff."" Monk's not doing much fantasy-wise right now and the Hornets are in the playoff hunt, so that's unlikely to change anytime soon.

             ""I think that is the plan,"" Hornacek said after practice. The Knicks sent Noah away after he and Hornacek got into a skirmish at practice on Jan. 24, when Noah was upset that he played less than five minutes the night before.
""That’s something that happened three weeks ago, four weeks ago,"" Hornacek said. ""We’ve moved on. He’s ready to move on and maybe have an opportunity somewhere else."" While this story has no fantasy impacts, Noah could have helped a team missing Kristaps Porzingis. Noah's NBA career appears to be winding down in his 10th season.

             The Bulls do have five more back-to-back sets this season, so it would be nice if owners wouldn't have to concern themselves with LaVine missing random games during the fantasy playoffs. LaVine was ballin' in the five games headed into the All-Star break with averages of 22.4 points, 5.2 boards, 2.6 dimes, 2.2 triples, 1.2 steals and just 1.4 turnovers per game, so he should have a strong finish to the year.

             This was somewhat expected, but it's still very welcome news for Gordon owners. Gordon missed nine consecutive contests prior to the All-Star break, and was forced to withdraw from the Slam Dunk contest. Gordon has only been able to suit up for 39 games thus far this season, but he's averaging career highs in points (18.4), rebounds (8.3), 3-pointers (2.0), and minutes (34.0).

             Jerian Grant had been backing up Kris Dunn, but Grant will no longer be a part of the rotation. Payne has yet to play this season after undergoing foot surgery back in September but has been cleared. He's been a disappointment since OKC spent a lottery pick (14th overall) on him back in 2015. For his career, he is shooting an atrocious 37.8 percent from the field. However, the Bulls traded Taj Gibson, Doug McDermott and a 2018 2nd round draft pick to acquire Payne last season, so they will want to get a good look at him. However, his fantasy value is limited playing behind Dunn.

            Nikola Vucevic (hand) and Aaron Gordon (hip) are ""on track"" to play Thursday vs. the Knicks.
        
        
             Barring a setback, Vucevic will be back out there on Thursday following a two-month layoff, which will translate to Bismack Biyombo heading back to the second unit. Mario Hezonja has played really well in Gordon's absence, but his value figures to take a bit of a hit with AG back in action. Vucevic was flirting with top-15 value prior to going down, so he absolutely needs to be owned in all leagues at this point.

Felicio has shown flashes in the past, but with per-36 numbers of just 10.7 points, 7.6 boards, 1.9 dimes and 0.5 blocks this season, he's not much more than a low-end add in deep leagues for those seeking a big.

Nwaba has been solid in his three starts this season with averages of 9.0 points, 6.7 boards, 1.3 dimes, 1.3 steals, 1.3 swats on 52.2% shooting, so he's someone to consider swooping up in deep leagues.

Williams was buried on the depth chart in Houston, but did have a really strong summer league and could be interesting on a rebuilding team like the Knicks.

            According to Candace Buckner of the Washington Post, John Wall (knee surgery) ""no longer needs crutches and shows no visible hitch in his walk.""
        
        
             It's been two weeks since his surgery, and while John Wall didn't reveal much, he hinted that he's still hoping to return between the 6- to 8-week mark. ""I haven’t really tried to get back on the court yet so, just doing the little things. And I haven’t started running yet. So whenever I get to that point I can kind of start grasping stuff and understanding what level I’m at but right now it’s between six to eight weeks,"" he said. ""It might be longer but I don’t know. I haven’t got to that point."" We'll continue to track his progress every step of the way, but it's possible he returns in time to help his owners in the fantasy playoffs.

             He was hoping for another job before the season, but the right opportunity never came. Since then, Splitter has been working as a reporter.

             LeBron earned All-Star MVP honors and his team played surprisingly aggressive defense down the stretch, including a suffocating double-team against Stephen Curry at the end of regulation. In the process, LeBron passed Oscar Robertson for fifth-most assists in All-Star game history, and he's just two assists behind Bob Cousy. King James wasn't messing around tonight, and we can only hope this sets the tone for future All-Star games.

             Davis injured his groin early in the Pelicans' game on Wednesday, but it appears to be a non-issue. He looked fine during the All-Star game and there was no suggestion that he'd sit out with the injury, so owners can anticipate him being fully rested and ready after the break. The Pelicans play two games in Week 19, followed by a three-game Week 20. Davis also deserves kudos for wearing injured teammate DeMarcus Cousins' jersey to begin this year's All-Star game.

            Vince Carter is expected to spend the rest of the season in Sacramento, as the Kings reportedly prefer not to buy him out.
        
        
             There were rumors in Toronto that Carter and the Raptors might reunite if VC was bought out and became a free agent this month. However, it appears the Kings want to hold onto their vet. Yet, it sounds like there is an outside chance that the 41-year old Carter finishes his career where it began by signing a one year deal with the Raps over the summer.

             Next Tuesday will mark two months since Jackson suffered his Grade-3 right ankle sprain. He was initially projected to miss 6-8 weeks, but it sounds like Jackson ""might need a few more weeks."" He has shed his walking boot but has not yet been cleared to practice with the team. ""I don’t have any preconceived notion at all of when he’ll be back,"" Van Gundy said on Wednesday. ""When (the team doctors) tell me he’s back, he’s back."" Ish Smith will continue to start at point guard, with Jameer Nelson backing him up.

             Thompson won't have an opportunity to test free agency until July of 2019, but he is already getting asked questions about potentially leaving Golden State. While being the offensive focal point of another squad would be ideal for his fantasy production, it sounds like Klay is content to play his role on the stacked Warriors. ""Playing for one team your whole career is definitely special. Only so many guys have done it in professional sports, so it’ll be a goal of mine,"" said Thompson. ""Hopefully it all works out.""

             After the Knicks loss to the Wizards on Wednesday, Hornacek told reporters he would likely tinker with the starting lineup after the team returned from the All-Star break. The player most likely to be bumped to the bench is aging veteran Jarrett Jack. Ntilikina or newly acquired Emmanuel Mudiay are expected to inherit the starting PG gig. Either way, both Mudiay and Ntilikina should see additional minutes over the second half of the season.

Looking ahead, the Kings don't have much to play for except lottery balls, but Bogdanovic gives them a reason to be hopeful for the future and we're going to see him run a lot of offense alongside De'Aaron Fox after the break. ""I trust him with the ball,"" Kings head coach Dave Joerger said. ""I don’t think he’s a shooter, I think he’s a playmaker who can shoot."" His teammate Buddy Hield added 29 points, Ben Simmons racked up 11 points, 13 assists, six rebounds and four steals, while Jaylen Brown led Team USA with 35 points.

             Randolph was rested sporadically in January, as the Kings decided to give more playing time to their youngsters. However, due to injuries, Z-Bo has been back in the lineup nearly every night. Prior to the final game before the All-Star break, Randolph had started nine straight games and was averaging 15.4 point and 8.0 rebounds in 27.9 minutes over that stretch. ""You get a good rhythm,"" Randolph said. ""Especially something that I’m not used to, the team developing our young players. So you get into a good rhythm, it’s important, playing and getting that feel.""

""Shabazz hasn’t gotten out on the floor to play very much, so he’s disappointed,"" Taylor said. ""He would like to get with a team that he could put in more minutes and show his skill-set. We have given the OK that if he finds such a team he can go to and wants to walk away, [he can] get out of our contract."" Muhammad is likely stuck in Minnesota unless he wants to give some money back. He should be left on waivers in all fantasy formats.

             The scoring was a major letdown, especially with one of KAT's best games every coming against the Lakers back in April 2017 when he put up 40 and 21.

He's fantasy's top player for total value in nine-category leagues so far, but KAT does have a disadvantage in games played the rest of the way.

            Jimmy Butler scored 24 points with five rebounds, four assists, one steal, three blocks and one turnover in 41 minutes against the Lakers on Thursday.
        
        
             He and coach Tom Thibodeau seem to be a good fit together with Jimmy playing some of his best ball right now. According to NBA.com's David Aldridge, Thibs could ""do whatever is necessary"" to keep Butler on the Wolves for a long time, which could include an extension this summer. Either way, his fantasy owners have a stud on their hands the rest of the way, but the Wolves have played two more games than every other team in the NBA. His fantasy owners may want to check how that affects them.

             He only scored 23 points for the entire season before tonight, so this was a shocker. Zubac has reportedly been very impressive in the G League and it looks like the Lakers will go back to giving him minutes. He was really starting to turn the corner last season before a season-ending injury, so maybe the Lakers try it again. He did only play six minutes combined in the last two games, so he still has a lot of work to do before he becomes a hot pickup in standard leagues. He's more of a mystery-box stash in deeper leagues.

             He did have some defensive issues and he fouled out in this loss. Randle should continue to see the lion's share of minutes at power forward and he continues to hang around 32 minutes per game. He also had some momentum coming into this game, averaging 20.3 points, 7.5 boards, 3.8 assists, 0.7 blocks and 0.2 treys. He's kind of peaking.

             He's clearly lacking a rapport with his team and he hinted that he had to stand up for himself against Rajon Rondo when he was ejected on Wednesday. Thomas isn't a part of the Lakers' future and it's a mystery what the team will do with him once Lonzo Ball comes back. Expect Thomas to be a mid-round player as long as he's active.

             Just when it looked like Lopez was safe, he lost a lot of run to Ivica Zubac today. Zubac isn't really a high-volume guy, so Lopez should still be able to hit minutes in the 20s almost every night. He also said he wants to stay with the Lakers, so he should still be owned in all leagues.

             It's still unclear what his role is going to be after the break and it's possible he does lose some run to the younger players.

             He recorded the quickest triple-double based on his playing time at just 14:33 played to break Jim Tucker's record of 17 minutes back in 1955. Jokic also hit the triple-double mark with 1:54 left in the second quarter to make it the quickest in the last 20 years based on game-clock time. The Joker also joins James Harden and Larry Bird as the only players with at least 30 points, 15 boards and 15 dimes in a game over the last 35 years. He's also loved playing the Bucks with a triple-double in each of his last three games against them. It's almost hard to believe how much skill this 22-year-old Serbian has.

             He caught fire in the third quarter to help give the Nuggets a huge cushion in the third. On the downside, Murray actually missed multiple free throws for the first time this season, which is very impressive for a guy with over 160 attempts on the season. He'll be taking his silky smooth jumper to Los Angeles to defend his Rising Stars MVP. The Blue Arrow is having a breakout year in reality and fantasy.

             He was called probable today and apparently likes to be on the injury report. He hit his signature game-winning jumper against OKC with a minor ankle issue, he dropped 23 against the Knicks in January with a minor injury, and he had 25 against Dallas when he had a personal issue put him on the report last month, too. Harris still doesn't get the credit he deserves in the mainstream hoops world, but hardcore fans and fantasy owners know how special he is.

             The minutes are surging for Chandler now with 37.0 per game over his previous two, which came after just 22.0 in the two games prior to those. He's arguably the No. 6 scoring option on this team, but that kind of volume for playing time should allow him to add non-scoring stats. He'll cool off next month when Paul Millsap (wrist) returns, but he's worth owning in standard leagues while he's hot and healthy.

             That's his ninth triple-double of his career to set a Bucks franchise record. This was also Antetokounmpo's first double-digit dime game of the year, and it's become very clear scoring the ball is his best attribute. Giannis sits at a tidy 60.6 TS% with his 31.7 usage rate on the season, so he's in some elite company with only six points qualifiers ever hitting those two numbers in a season. The Bucks will battle for playoff positioning in the second half and Giannis should be very active the rest of the way.

             It was one of his worst defensive games of his sophomore season with Nikola Jokic taking him to school on the block. John Henson (hamstring) could be back after the break, so Maker is a fairly easy drop in even 20-team leagues.

             The Bucks still have a clear minutes cap on him and he didn't close this game out. Parker has been shooting jumpers with four shots outside of the restricted area tonight, and he's had some trouble getting clean looks from two-point range so far this season. Maybe he'll see more run after the break, but Parker's fantasy owners shouldn't have more than a top-75 ceiling the rest of the way. Hopefully, he can flirt with around top-100 value.

            Tyler Zeller scored 14 points with five rebounds, one assist and one block in 30 minutes against the Nuggets on Thursday.
        
        
             At the trade deadline, it was a mild surprise that the Bucks gave up anything to get a guy who was out of the rotation, but the Bucks are getting a lot out of Zeller right now. He's coming off a 14-point, eight-board Tuesday, but perhaps the biggest takeaway here is that the center position in Milwaukee will be a headache. Most fantasy owners will probably want to avoid Zeller, John Henson and Thon Maker in the second half.

             Those five steals get him back in second place with his 2.12 steals per game this year (Paul George has 2.21, Victor Oladipo has 2.10). Bledsoe's scoring is also up over his last six games with 21.5 points per game while adding strong percentages and full lines. He's trending up and is a strong bet for top-50 value the rest of the way.

             He was listed as out for this one and he'll have the break to get his hamstring strain right. Henson may have lost some ground while he was out because Thon Maker has played well and Tyler Zeller has fit in with the second unit. Henson is more of a drop than a stash.

The Hawks holding Ersan Ilyasova and Kent Bazemore out for that game explains the playing time, so White will likely need more team DNPs to make an impact.

             His chest soreness was a problem for him on Tuesday night and he was able to play through it. Murray's chest soreness will probably go away over the break and he's fully expected to defend his crown as the MVP of the Rising Stars game.RotoGrinders.com Daily Slant: Murray shouldn't be limited at all in terms of playing time, especially given that he was able to eat up 38 minutes against San Antonio on Thursday. His match-up with Eric Bledsoe and the Bucks isn't a great one, as Milwaukee ranks 8th in defensive efficiency against PGs. Gary Harris - who has a nearly identical price tag to Murray - is in a better spot and can certainly pay off big in GPPs at a $6K salary.

             He's not in the G-League either, so we're not sure what's going on here. Malik Beasley will have a chance to play a handful of minutes if Craig doesn't join the team in time for Thursday's game.

             It's been six months since Henderson had surgery on his hip, and while he was originally expected to miss the entire 2017-18 season, he's reportedly ahead of schedule. Maybe he latches on with a contender when the buyout market slows down, but it's probably more likely that he signs a contact this offseason.

             ""I do think he's going to be back after the break and I'm looking forward to getting him out there,"" Carlisle said. ""It's an opportunity for us as we move along here to look at potential young groups that could be playing together into the future to see the viability, the chemistry, those kinds of things."" When asked what he wants to see from Noel, Carlisle said he wants ""passion, hard play, rebounding and some chemistry with his teammates."" There's no guarantee that Noel will be out of the doghouse when he's cleared, so he's just a luxury stash in deeper leagues for now.

             ""Jarrett can play the four because he can defend the position. [Jahlil Okafor] right now is more of a traditional five, a closer-to-the-basket guy,"" Atkinson said. ""We have to look at all options. Jarrett’s played some four. It’s not perfect because of the shooting … he’s not spreading the floor like a traditional four. But we could look at it at times."" We won't read too much into this for now, but it just goes to show how versatile the  19-year-old Allen is. He's played 20 or fewer minutes in three straight games, but we expect that to start trending back up.

             Nurkic was iffy with a sore lower back, but played very well against the Warriors, and was instrumental in them getting the big win. Nurkic is always going to be an injury concern, but the No. 6 Blazers currently sit a half game ahead of the Nuggets and Pelicans, meaning they'll be fighting for their playoff lives going forward. Hopefully that will help Nurk Alert to stay happy and healthy the rest of the way.

He's been absurdly good lately and has scored 133 points over the past three games, which shatters the Blazers' previous franchise record. He's attempted double-digit free throws in each of those games, and owners should hope he maintains such aggression on the other side of the All-Star break.

             Aminu was averaging 7.8 points on 31.1% shooting in his previous five games, so it was nice to see him knock down some shots tonight. He still returned roto value in 12-team leagues in that five-game span, however, thanks to 1.6 triples, 9.0 rebounds, 1.4 assists, 1.6 steals, 0.4 blocks and a mere 0.6 turnovers. He's nowhere near as appealing in points-based leagues, of course.

             Pachulia should only be in a handful of deep-league lineups anyway, but his undoing tonight was the Warriors going even smaller than usual -- Nick Young even started the second half in place of Pachulia. The Warriors' loss gives Houston the best record in the NBA heading into the All-Star break, a fact Rockets GM Daryl Morey cheekily acknowledged by Tweeting ""#ripcity"" after the Blazers victory.

             Green rounded out this fantasy gem with 6-of-13 field goals and 3-of-3 free throws, without a single turnover. He came up with a critical block against C.J. McCollum with 1:41 remaining, but the Warriors couldn't get over the hump in an eventual 123-117 loss. Draymond heads into the All-Star break healthy, with top-25 fantasy value on the season, so his owners aren't complaining.

             The Warriors trailed by 12 points at halftime and coach Steve Kerr decided to mix things up with a small lineup. We're not likely to see this often, though, and the real boost to Young's fantasy outlook came before the game with Patrick McCaw (wrist) ruled out approximately four weeks. Young still isn't worth touching in most leagues, though.

             Iguodala is always a low-usage player for the Warriors, but he took it to an extreme tonight. The 29 minutes were his highest since Jan. 10, so maybe he'll earn more minutes until Patrick McCaw (wrist) gets back in approximately four weeks. Even if he does see a bump from his current 25.5 minutes per game, he's not a viable option in 12-team leagues.

             His heel went out of bounds on a 3-pointer that would have brought the Warriors within one point with 8.8 seconds left, but on a night when his teammates were struggling, Durant was a one-man wrecking crew. He even made consecutive four-point plays during an 18-point outburst in the third quarter, giving him 13 such plays in his auspicious career. This is the most he's scored with the Warriors, and his highest-scoring game since 2014, sending fantasy owners into the All-Star break smiling.

             Break up the Jazz. They're on an NBA-high active win streak at 11 games with Mitchell leading the way. He becomes the first rookie in NBA history to lead his team in scoring during a win streak of at least 11 games. Mitchell has also hit his stride with volume as a scorer with 24-plus in each of his last four games while launching 8.8 treys per game. The Jazz have one of the more favorable schedules among Western Conference teams, so don't be surprised if this Rookie of the Year candidate leads his team to the postseason.

             He made 7-of-12 from the field and both free throws to make this a fantasy gem. O'Neale has been incredible in his three starts, and he fits in perfectly on this roster. In his three starts, he leads the Jazz with a +22.1 net rating over his 107 minutes, averaging 10.3 points, 6.3 boards, 2.7 assists, 1.3 steals, 0.7 blocks and 1.0 treys. He won't blow you away on the stat sheet and Ricky Rubio returning will probably drop Royce to 26-29 minutes, but he's worth a look in some 14-team formats.

             It was pretty clear his left hip was bothering him as he was grabbing at it throughout the game. He was still aggressive and the injury didn't seem to affect his play, so the All-Star break should get him right. Plus, coach Jay Triano said he wouldn't play Booker at less than 100 percent, so it's mostly positive on the injury front. The Booker PG experiment isn't over yet, but the Suns did run a PG out there for 48 minutes in this game. Either way, Booker's value in fantasy will be fine as long as he's active. He said earlier this week he did not want to rest, so that'll help.

             Mirotic was initially reported as a starter tonight, but at the last second Emeka Okafor took his spot. New Orleans will vary the lineup based on matchups, according to coach Alvin Gentry, but Mirotic's minutes and touches should be safe regardless -- he logged 30 minutes tonight. He's a solid 'hold' and should only get better as he builds chemistry with his new team.

He does look to be ahead of Marquese Chriss, and you would think Alex Len won't last long if the Suns play him 38 minutes. Bender will be annoying to own, but he has upside.

            Elfrid Payton posted the ninth triple-double of his career against the Jazz on Wednesday, scoring 13 points with 11 rebounds, 12 assists, one steal, one block, five turnovers and one 3-pointer in 39 minutes.
        
        
             It's his first triple-double of the season and his first since Apr. 1 of last season. Payton finds himself in an ideal spot for his fantasy value because the Suns do not have any traditional point guards that can threaten his playing time, and the increased pace helps, too. Devin Booker should still see time at point guard, but obviously Payton will be getting his, especially with how he's shown some chemistry with bigs on pick and roll. He's trending up.

             Davis exited briefly with a right groin injury, but it obviously didn't impact him as he led New Orleans to a franchise-record 139 points in a home win vs. the Lakers. He's good for an injury scare almost every night, but he's only missed six games this season (one since Dec. 11). New Orleans is playing him 38.4 minutes per game over the past month, so he'll surely welcome some rest during the All-Star break. We'll let you know if the Pelicans provide more updates about his injury status, but presumably he'll be fine for the All-Star game.

             Pelicans tied their franchise record with 139 points tonight, powered by a huge game from Anthony Davis (42 points) and a big lift from the second unit. New Orleans ranks 29th in bench scoring, ahead of only the Wolves, but games like this could become more common if Nikola Mirotic is deployed as a reserve. When he's not torching the Lakers defense, though, Miller is just a fringe 3-point specialist.

             Wow. Maybe the Suns were slow-playing Len after his ankle injuries kept him in check for most of the past month, but he looked very active today in a tough matchup against Rudy Gobert. There are a lot of things that can go wrong here and Tyson Chandler did not play due to neck spasms. All that said, that playing time is almost too high to leave on the wire for anyone needing a big man. He has serious upside.

             With Devin Booker back, the move to the bench did not hurt Jackson at all as the Suns went very tight on their wing rotation and did go with some small-ball fours. Jackson is one of the hottest rookies on the stat sheet and especially in the scoring column, scoring 20-plus in six of his last nine games. While he does have some issues in percentages, Jackson is shaping up to be a bargain off the wire after his terrible start.

In his current role, KCP is just a steals-and-threes specialist.

             Lonzo Ball (knee) said recently that he feels ""good enough to play,"" but will rest through the All-Star break as a precaution. It will be very interesting to see how coach Luke Walton handles his rotations once his backcourt is complete, but Hart should still find minutes with the versatility to play multiple positions. The same can't be said for veterans like Isaiah Thomas and Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, both of whom are on expiring contracts.

             Grant dished out six assists in the first quarter before his teammates cooled off and Toronto's defense stepped up their effort. He had some hot stretches while Dunn was out of commission, but most owners should search for a safer option on the wire.

             This was a garbage-time special with all of Vonleh's minutes coming in the fourth quarter of a blowout loss. Chicago is going to play their young guys more after the break, though, so Vonleh is at least worth keeping an eye on in deep leagues.

             He was 0-for-4 from downtown, but notched his 17th triple-double of the season, while he's missed several others by just a point, rebound or assist. The Thunder are the currently the No. 5 seed in the West, but sit just one game ahead of the Nuggets, Pelicans and Blazers, while the Clippers are just 1.5 games back, and the Jazz are 2.5 games back. Westbrook is going to have to continue to play at a high level while they chase the Timberwolves and Spurs, and try to hold off all the pursuers. Westbrook's ankle appears to be fine and he'll hopefully be able to get a little rest during the All-Star break.

             Lowry was a model of efficiency tonight -- didn't turn the ball over while racking up stats and making 5-of-10 FGs and 6-of-6 FTs. His minutes have dipped lately due to a combination of factors, including frequent blowouts and the excellent play of Toronto's bench. He may not attain the early-round value owners hoped for on draft day, but don't sleep on him as the Raptors chase the No. 1 seed in the East.

             The Raptors sport a 41-16 record, which is the best in franchise history going into an All-Star break. It's been good enough for the No. 1 seed, and the play of the second unit has been a big reason for that success. Tonight was no different, with Pascal Siakam scoring 17 points, Fred VanVleet adding 11 points and four dimes, and Delon Wright scoring seven points with six assists. There was a lot of garbage time tonight, but  if you're looking for sneaky pickups in a competitive league, don't pass over the Raptors' reserves.

This was his highest-scoring game since Jan. 5 and owners can only hope that the extended break allows him to come back refreshed for Toronto's final 25 regular-season games.

             Carmelo Anthony could learn something from PG-13's efficiency, and hit 7-of-18 shots and four 3-pointers for 19 points and almost nothing else. George has blended in nicely with Russell Westbrook and the Thunder have a slew of teams sniffing their tails for a playoff berth in the West. George needs to continue to play at a high level if the Thunder are going to survive, so look for more big lines coming his way going forward.

             He battled through the illness, but Jarell Martin stepped up with a solid game of 17 points, eight rebounds, two steals, a block and a 3-pointer off the bench. The Grizzlies know what Green can do and are not going to make the playoffs, so it wouldn't be shocking to see Green give way to Martin at some point. Green should still be considered the starter for now, but if Green sees limited minutes in the next one, it could be time to make a move. Green's minutes could have been limited by his illness, but either way, the Grizzlies have almost no choice but to make a run with their youth movement to close out the season. Stay tuned.

             It's his second double-double of the season with those 11 boards coming as a season-high. Encouraging game aside, Morris' body of work indicates he needs serious volume to have fantasy value, and he's not going to get it on this deep team. He only has 14th-round value per game this year, so most owners can do better.

             Marc Gasol was in foul trouble and the Grizzlies, literally, have nothing left to play for. It makes sense for them to shut Gasol down and let Davis play the rest of the way, but there have been no indications that they plan on doing that. They're 13.5 games or so out of the playoff hunt, so there's a decent chance Davis could get a ton of run after the All-Star break. He's a stash candidate, at least worth keeping a close eye on in case the Grizzlies decide to change course and play the kids.

             Gasol says he's going to finish out the season and the Grizzlies appear to feel the same way, but the fact remains they're 13.5 games or so out of the playoff race and there's no reason for him to keep going out there and beating up his body. There's still a chance Gasol is not shut down and finishes out the season, but if you own him, stashing Deyonta Davis as insurance makes some sense.

             Welcome back, Chandler? He hadn't played since Dec. 27 due to lingering knee issues and the Grizzlies have lost seven in a row and have no shot at the playoffs. It makes sense for Parsons to be shut down for risk of further damaging his knees, but for now the Grizzlies are going to try to play him. He has no fantasy value.

Lance Thomas started the Knicks' previous game and this could evolve into an ever-changing rotation, especially once New York really goes young later in the season.

The youth movement could be on in Memphis, making Martin worth a look. Green had played 30 minutes in each of his previous two games, but the Grizzlies could finally be ready to admit defeat and start prepping for the future. Martin isn't a must-own player, but has played at least 25 minutes in three straight games, nearly had a double-double in his last game, and looked great on Wednesday. If Green gets limited minutes again in the next one and Martin plays well, think about making the switch.

The Knicks continue to start Jarrett Jack at PG but that's unlikely to last long after the break, so Mudiay's minutes could trend up in a hurry. He's worth a look if you need a PG and can live with lousy percentages and high turnovers -- as if to prove the point, he shot 3-of-9 from the field tonight with four turnovers.

             Harrison disappeared in Sunday's game, also against the Thunder, which happened to coincide with the return of Tyreke Evans. Harrison picked up five quick fouls against Russell Westbrook in that one and lasted just 11 minutes, while Mario Chalmers played 30 minutes off the bench, but finished with just six points, six assists and four turnovers. Harrison was back with a vengeance tonight and he's young, meaning the Grizzlies might keep running him out there in a lost season. Despite Harrison's dud on Sunday, he's still averaging 15.6 points, 1.8 rebounds, 3.0 assists, 0.6 steals, 0.8 blocks and 2.0 3-pointers on 55 percent shooting over his last five games. He's not the most trustworthy guy around right now, but he's played at least 31 minutes in three of his last five games, and Tyreke Evans was back for two of those. If you own Harrison, just hang on until we see how this all shakes out.

            Tomas Satoransky (concussion) had multiple career-highs on Wednesday with 11 assists and three blocks, adding nine points, four rebounds and one 3-pointer in 33 minutes.
        
        
             Satoransky survived a scary fall on Saturday, which is great news for a Wizards team still seeking PG help while John Wall (knee) recuperates. Even if they do bring back a veteran to fill out the rotation, it shouldn't impact Satoransky, who has a stranglehold on the starting job until Wall returns.

             He continues to shoot the ball much worse at home with his 28th game at Toyota Center resulting in another subpar stat line. Anderson is probably going to have his minutes held in check, especially with Joe Johnson in the mix. He's only a specialist and most owners can probably do better.

             The Wizards' reserve big man doesn't typically have fantasy appeal while Marcin Gortat is healthy. He outplayed Gortat tonight, though, and coach Scott Brooks rewarded him with big minutes -- Mahinmi managed to tie his season-highs in scoring and blocks, while falling one shy in rebounds. It's a welcome sight for the Wizards, but we're not buying it for fantasy purposes.

             Evans played on Sunday after being shut down for ""trade rumors,"" but didn't do much in his 26 minutes. However, he was great tonight, but the Grizzlies still lost again for the 38th time. They say they're not going to shut guys like Evans and Marc Gasol down, but they're 13.5 games or so out of the playoff race and have absolutely nothing to play for. Evans should continue to produce in the near future, but at some point the Grizzlies are going to face reality and sit some veterans. Keep starting him, but have a backup plan in mind in case the Grizzlies finally decide to sit the vets and tank it up.

             He's running the offense more and he's arguably been the biggest winner from the George Hill trade. Since that deal, Bogdanovic averaged 17.3 points, 4.0 boards, 5.7 assists, 1.0 steals and 3.0 treys in those three games. He's making a clear case that he's worth owning in standard leagues.

Most teams would love the luxury of Holmes as frontcourt depth, yet he had as many DNPs as minutes in his previous seven games.

            Hassan Whiteside had 16 points, 10 rebounds, three blocks and one assist in 29 minutes on Wednesday, but the Heat still blew a huge lead in Philly.
        
        
             It's worth noting that Whiteside did check in for Bam Adebayo with 5:46 remaining in a tight game, and he played almost the rest of the way. He went 7-of-10 from the field and 2-of-3 from the line to satisfy fantasy owners -- a bigger line would have been nice with Joel Embiid out tonight, but we shouldn't get greedy.

             Wade said the Heat haven't discussed putting him on a ""maintenance"" program, which could entail sitting out during back-to-backs and having a strict minute-limit. Heat coach Erik Spoelstra didn't rule it out entirely, though, just saying that such a plan wasn't in place ""right now."" Even without restrictions, Wade is just a fringe option in most 12-team leagues.

             That's a wrap for the All-Star's first half and he is making a strong case for Most Improved Player. After his mediocre 21.3 usage rate last year, Oladipo bumped that all the way up to 30.3 this year with a very impressive efficiency of 58.9 TS%. He's second in steals per game and his stat-stuffing ways have made him a top-10 player this season.

             It was easily the most productive game on the stat sheet after Joseph didn't have a single steal or block in his previous three games. Joseph apparently likes to play against the Nets because he had a career-high 33 against them last year. Darren Collison should be back shortly after the break, so CoJo is more of a drop than an add.

             Wesley Iwundu briefly took Simmons' spot with the starters, but that didn't last long -- Simmons was back in the game with 9:33 left in the third quarter. He committed five turnovers tonight, so maybe that raised coach Frank Vogel's ire, but either way it's not likely to have long-term implications.

             Hezonja piled up four steals and three blocks in an all-around game on Monday, and he's been soaring in an expanded role without Aaron Gordon (hip). There's no stated return date for Gordon but he'll have an extended rest over the break, so Hezonja's owners should prepare for leaner stats. To be clear, he's scored 20+ points in three straight games and should obviously be held while we see how his role evolves.

             There are not many non-star players hotter than Crabbe over his last four, averaging 25.3 points, 5.5 boards, 1.0 assists, 0.8 steals and 5.3 treys on 50.7 percent from the field. He's certainly benefitted from the Nets having some injuries, but his strong play can help him earn more run once the team gets healthy again. He's too hot to be on the wire right now.

             He was running in transition and got tripped up to cause his head to hit the floor. Fox looked to be bleeding above his right eye and he will almost certainly be getting checked for a concussion. He was a little dazed as he headed back to the locker room, so hopefully everything is OK. He finished with nine points, two rebounds, three assists, one steal and one 3-pointer in 26 minutes.

             Coach Kenny Atkinson has kept his rookie on a much tighter leash and Allen did not start the third quarter today. He was a little careless with the ball with his four turnovers, but he's been able to keep his fouls down. Just about all rookies will have their slumps, but Allen's upside makes him worth owning in all leagues.

             Griffin said after Detroit's loss on Monday that his team looked ""tired,"" but they bounced back tonight against a short-handed Hawks team playing the second of back-to-back games. Blake turned the ball over six times and was also 1-of-3 from the FT line, so owners will have to take the good with the bad. Chalk it up to the learning curve of joining a new team mid-season.

             Smith also had just one turnover in 33 minutes and he helped limit the Hawks to 42.7% shooting tonight, which has been a weak spot for the Pistons lately. This was Smith's best performance since Feb. 3 and he heads into the break on a high note, even if this came against a decimated Hawks team playing without Dennis Schroder. If you're holding him, just remember that Reggie Jackson (ankle) could be back in by March.

Stan Van Gundy is tweaking his backcourt rotation on a nightly basis these days, as he tries to conjure productive minutes from an underwhelming group of guards. There's no reason to touch Kennard in re-draft leagues.

             Taylor was aided by the absence of Dennis Schroder (back) and Kent Bazemore (rest), of course, but he's worth monitoring as we head toward March.

            Alex Abrines (left hip contusion) will not return to Wednesday's game against the Grizzlies.
        
        
             The Thunder are getting a little thin at shooting guard with Andre Roberson (knee) already out, so they may have to go bigger with more Jerami Grant and Josh Huestis. Grant is already on the radar as a pickup, so give him a look if his defense-first style suits you.

            Coach Terry Stotts said Jusuf Nurkic (low back soreness, right calf strain and right oblique strain) will start against the Warriors on Wednesday.
        
        
             He is all sorts of banged up right now, so he may even be limited if he's out there. Nurkic has been fairly durable this year with only a three-game stretch in December resulting in his DNPs this season. If he's limited, we could see more Zach Collins or Ed Davis.

             He was dragged away by a ref and a team security person after a heated exchange with Isaiah Thomas. These were Rondo's first two techs of the season and he likely won't see a suspension for this infraction. We'll see more E'Twaun Moore, Darius Miller and DeAndre Liggins with Rondo out.

            Isaiah Thomas was ejected early in Wednesday's game after an argument with Rajon Rondo, finishing with three points, two assists and one rebound in five minutes.
        
        
             Both players were hit with technicals, but they continued to jaw at each other so the refs tossed them both. It looked like Rondo was more of the aggressor in the situation, but neither guy should face further repercussions from the league. Without IT available, we're likely to see a ton of Josh Hart while Tyler Ennis could also crack the rotation.

We'll have an update shortly, Cheick Diallo replaced him. It's good news that he was called questionable to return, but he may sit this out one the rest of the way.

He and Elfrid Payton will likely be staggered and the Suns are still expected to use Booker at PG.

             This was a last-second switch after Mirotic was previously reported to be starting. It shouldn't impact either player's minutes much, however, so there aren't any big swings for fantasy value.

             Nikola Mirotic will take the reins as a starter and this is going to be a matchup-dependent situation going forward. Okafor isn't worth deploying even when starting, though, so it hardly matters where he begins games.

Gordon has a few knee injuries on his medical chart, so sitting him out before the break makes sense. Joe Johnson will fill in right away while P.J. Tucker and Gerald Green could take more shots.

             This is a small surprise with Embiid not playing against his trash-talking counterpart, Hassan Whiteside. Embiid has been playing in back-to-back sets now, but he's been on the injury report for basically every game these days. He'll get some extra time off to recover over the All-Star break. Amir Johnson, Trevor Booker and Richaun Holmes should play more.

             This is different from the earlier report saying it was going to be Dragan Bender. With Devin Booker likely back, it'll be interesting to see if the Suns go small  at forward or they slide Bender over to the four. Either way, Len isn't really a pickup until he shows he can be healthy for over two games.

             His minutes took a hit on Tuesday night because of DeAndre Bembry getting run last night, but this time he should be able to get close to 30 with Kent Bazemore and Ersan Ilyasova not playing tonight. Dorsey's upside isn't too high and most of his contributions will be as a shooter, but he's worth a stream or DFS punt.

             The Hawks are missing three of their five starters, so Prince figures to be extremely busy on offense, while guys like Delaney, Dorsey and Collins could be worth punting in DFS. Delaney hasn't been great in his previous two starts this season, owning averages of 8.0 points, 2.5 dimes and 1.5 steals per game, although per nbawowy.com, his usage does jump to 21.4 when Dennis Schroder, Kent Bazemore and Ersan Ilyasova are off the floor.RotoGrinders.com Daily Slant: John Collins owns a 1.04 FPPM (fantasy points per minute) rate with Schroder, Bazemore and Ilyasova plus all non-rotation members off the floor this season, and in that same split, Malcolm Delaney averages 0.88 and Tyler Dorsey is sitting on 0.70. Mike Muscala, who will provide depth at PF/C, owns a 0.78 rate.

            John Collins will start Wednesday against the Pistons.
        
        
             The Hawks have played him at more power forward these days and he'll get a date against Blake Griffin. Collins has seen more late minutes these days, but he does have some fouling concerns and that's a big reason why his minutes haven't gone up too much with Miles Plumlee out of the rotation. While the minutes haven't busted out yet, it's only a matter of time before he starts to see consistent playing time. He'll be a popular DFS play.

             Booker will go through his pregame routine before an official decision is made, but it's worth pointing out that just two days ago Jay Triano said Booker couldn't move at NBA speed, and Triano also said this morning that Booker wouldn't play unless he's clearly 100 percent. He's going to be a true game-time call tonight, making him a bit too risky to deploy in DFS. If he is able to get out there, Elfrid Payton won't have the rock in his hands quite as often. Stay tuned.

             Coach Jay Triano sounded encouraged about Booker playing earlier today, and it sounds like Booker is going to be out there. He's almost certainly going to be a game-time decision in a late start, so we likely won't have any concrete info until after lineups lock. His return means Elfrid Payton won't have to handle the ball as much, and those two guards should be staggered. Tyson Chandler is out, so the other starters should remain the same with Dragan Bender, Josh Jackson, Payton and T.J. Warren.

Booker was vocal about wanting to play earlier this week and he hasn't been ruled out for the 3-point contest.

             Daniels will have his finger taped on his shooting hand, which will likely impact his shot. However, Daniels is not a fantasy asset even when fully healthy, so he should be left on waivers.

             Satoransky was injured Saturday night, crashing to the floor after a flagrant foul. However, he avoided a concussion and is ready to pick up where he left off (he poured in a career-high 25 points on Saturday). Tim Frazier (nose) has been ruled out of Wednesday's game, so Satoransky will see all the minutes he can handle on Wednesday. The risk of re-injury is a concern, but he will still be a very popular DFS target tonight.

Schroder popped up on the injury report with lower back stiffness last week, but hasn't missed a game since before Christmas. With Schroder sidelined,  Malcolm Delaney and Isaiah Taylor will divvy up minutes at point guard. Schroder will likely be good to go next week, but could be sporadically rested over the second half of the season.

            Justin Anderson (sprained right ankle) will not play Wednesday vs. Miami and will be re-evaluated in 7-10 days.
        
        
             Anderson limped off the floor in Monday's win over the Knicks, and it appears he is dealing with a high ankle sprain. Fourtuanety, the All-Star break comes at a good time for Anderson, as he'll have eight days to rest/rehab the ankle. Anderson only sees limited minutes off the Sixers bench even when healthy, so he should be left on waivers.

            Joel Embiid (right ankle soreness) is questionable Wednesday's game vs. Miami.
        
        
             Embiid has been listed as questionable in each of Philly's last two games, but has suited up and dominated both contests, scoring at least 24 points and grabbing 16 rebounds in each game. This is the Sixers last game before the All-Star break, so he'll have the added benefit of extra rest in the near future. Check back later for confirmation of his status.

             Coach Scott Brooks said on Tuesday that Satoransky's status for Wednesday's game was uncertain, as Satoransky needs to pass a second round of concussion testing. The Wizards indicated they will provide an update on his status this afternoon. Tim Frazier (nose) has already been ruled out of Wednesday's game, so Satoransky will see all the minutes he can handle if he is cleared to play.

             This was a no-brainer for the Magic. Sitting Gordon, who has already withdrawn from the dunk contest during All-Star weekend, on Wednesday allows him an extra eight days of rest. In addition, the more losses the better for Orlando at this point, as they have a solid chance to land the No. 1 overall pick in the 2018 NBA draft. Mario Hezonja, who has scored 20-plus points in two straight games, will continue to see extended minutes on Wednesday.

Fortunately, this is Washington's final game before the All-Star break. We are still awaiting an update on Tomas Satoransky, who has to be cleared out of concussion protocol after a nasty fall Saturday night. The Wizards could be dangerously thin at point guard Wednesday vs. the Knicks.

             Ginobili went to the locker room and took a trainer with him mid-way through the third quarter on Tuesday. He was later ruled out and did not return. However, the X-rays came back clean and, according to Spurs beat writer Jeff McDonald, ""the team expects to find no serious injury in further tests planned for Wednesday."" San Antonio doesn't play again until after the All-Star break, on February 23rd, so Manu will have plenty of time to rest the foot.

             Mudiay told reporters that he twisted the ankle early in Monday's game and that it limited his mobility. This is noteworthy, as his right ankle has been a career-long issue for Mudiay. He has missed time in each of his four pro seasons (including his time in China) due to right ankle injuries. As long as he stays healthy, he and Frank Ntilikina should continue to see plenty of playing time over the second half of the season.

             He had just six points in 21 minutes on Saturday and Will Barton and Wilson Chandler are really coming on for the Jazz. And given the fact that Paul Millsap's not back yet, the future doesn't look all that bright for Lyles. If you can drop him for Wilson Chandler, do it, and if you can't, dropping him for another hot free agent makes sense. It appears Lyles is being squeezed by the recent emergence of Chandler, who is averaging 37 minutes over his last two games, and filling the stat sheet in Nugget wins.

             Barton has now scored 20 or more in three of his last five games after struggling through much of January, and just like Wilson Chandler, looks like he's locked into a big role for the Nuggets going forward. The Nuggets are the No. 6 seed in the West, but are in a dogfight with the Thunder, Blazers, Pelicans, Clippers and Jazz, so they should be running at full speed through the end of the season. Barton should be owned in all leagues.

             He was pretty iffy to play and we didn't get word until late that he would be available, so not only was it nice to see him out there, but he had his first steal after failing to get one in his previous two games. He'd been a little quiet in his previous two games, in part to the injury, but was nice tonight. Hopefully he's ready to keep it going and finish up strong after the All-Star break.

             Jokic racked up his fourth triple-double of the season and it really should have been No. 5, as he missed one by two points back on Nov. 1. Jokic is who we thought he was and is rolling right now, averaging 18.4 points, 10.8 rebounds, 7.2 assists, 1.4 steals, 0.6 blocks and 1.6 3-pointers on 50 percent shooting over his last five, while also knocking down 88 percent of his free throws. Jokic's owners went through a rough patch when he was out half of December, but he's been on cruise control since Christmas, returning second-round fantasy value on the season.

            Dejounte Murray scored 12 points with five rebounds, two assists, two steals and three blocks in 27 minutes vs. the Nuggets on Tuesday.
        
        
             He was considered probable tonight because of his ankle and the back-to-back set, but he'll get plenty of time to rest up before San Antonio's next game on Feb. 23. Murray doesn't shoot many 3-pointers, but he's a solid source of points, rebounds, dimes and defensive stats and is worth owning in standard leagues. The starting job should be his the rest of the way.

             The fact that he did this on the second night of a back-to-back is a good sign, though he did play just 16 minutes Monday. He played 24 minutes this time around, adding four assists, one rebound, one steal and two triples. He also looked good next to Dejounte Murray, and maybe we'll see more of that combo if Manu Ginobili's foot injury forces him to miss time. The Spurs are off until Feb. 23 against in a rematch vs. Denver.

             Chandler has become very relevant over his last three games and has been really good in his last two, averaging 37 minutes, 21.5 points, 5.5 rebounds, 4.0 assists, 1.5 steals, 2.0 blocks and 1.5 3-pointers, hitting 19-of-34 shots. Chandler has been pretty bad since December (or the whole season) and as a result, is available in 69 percent of Yahoo! leagues. That may not be the case for much longer, and while it's a small sample size and there are no guarantees that it will last, Chandler has looked like a different player in the last few games. He's worth a flyer until we find out if it will last.

             This came out of nowhere with Joffrey playing 15 or fewer minutes in his previous eight games. LaMarcus Aldridge (knee) was out again tonight and Pau Gasol's minutes were held in check because of the back-to-back, so King Joffrey took advantage. The Spurs are off until after the All-Star break and LMA is expected back next game, so Joffrey isn't an add.

             He's getting minutes at the four and five these days and is one of the most efficient players in the NBA -- out of the 61 NBA players with at least 75 possessions as the latter half of the pick-and-roll, Powell leads them in scoring efficiency with 1.36 points per possession. He's scored at least 18 points in four straight games with at least six rebounds in each, so it's time to pick him up if he's still available in your league.

            Manu Ginobili went to the locker room and took a trainer with him mid-way through the third quarter on Tuesday due to pain in his right foot and is having X-rays.
        
        
             He won't return to the game and it was a non-contact injury, according to Caron Butler's report from the sidelines. He had eight points in 14 minutes before leaving, but is clearly more valuable to the Spurs than fantasy owners. Danny Green, Bryn Forbes, Tony Parker and a host of Spurs wings would see a boost if Ginobili's injury turns out to be serious, but he plays so few minutes there probably isn't a must-pickup either way.

             Matthews, J.J. Barea and Dirk Nowitzki all looked fine, suggesting that they were simply rested on Sunday vs. Houston on the second night of a back-to-back.

             The fresh legs clearly helped, as Barea's 13 dimes were a season-high and his five triples were as well. This was also his fifth double-double of the season. The Mavs are playing for lottery balls, but with Seth Curry (leg) out for the season and Devin Harris no longer around, maybe Barea can hold onto some low-end value for the time being. Just don't expect anywhere close to this kind of production.

             He played 32 minutes, but there was never any indication that he was going to be limited. It's safe to assume that Nowitzki was rested on Sunday vs. Houston on the second night of a back-to-back set, so his fantasy owners should be mindful of those going forward. Looking ahead, the Mavs do have a back-to-back set on Feb. 23 and Feb. 24, but maybe Dirk plays in both games since the Mavs now have nine days off for the All-Star break.

             Grant had been playing well with Carmelo Anthony out for most of the previous three games with an ankle injury, and remained relevant tonight, even with Melo back in action. However, Melo, Paul George, Steven Adams and Russell Westbrook are all back and healthy, meaning it will be tough for Grant to maintain his fantasy value going forward. Cutting him for a hot free agent makes sense, even though he was serviceable in this one.

             Westy missed his previous two games, but wasn't on a minutes limit tonight and is fully expected to play again on Wednesday. He didn't have a 3-pointer tonight and his shot wasn't exactly sharp, but at least he's back.

             The boards were a season-high best for Adams and the points represented one of his better offensive games of the season, as well.

Melo's not the most trustworthy guy in fantasy, but played well tonight and is still a big part of what the Thunder do. If he was dumped in your league while he was out for most of the last three games, he's probably worth grabbing.

             Hood's averaging 14.5 points, 2.5 rebounds, 1.5 steals and 3.5 3-pointers in his two games for the Cavs, and is going to be a key spot-up shooter from deep for the new-look Cavs. He may not have many assists, steals or blocks for his new teams, but he should score and hit a ton of 3-pointers, giving him some value in most fantasy leagues.

             He has really cooled off since his hot start to the new year, so maybe tonight's line is an indication that he's ready to break through the rookie wall. This was his highest scoring game since Jan. 17 and he was efficient as well, hitting 8-of-17 with just a single turnover. We love his rest-of-season outlook and he has legitimate mid-round upside, but that's assuming he keeps playing like he did tonight.

             The Kings used to rest two veterans every game, but Z-Bo has now played in nine straight because they are a little shorthanded. He's been pretty productive as well, scoring in double digits in eight of those games and grabbing at least seven rebounds in seven of those. That may change when Skal Labissiere (shoulder) returns to action, but for now Z-Bo's owners can keep throwing him into lineups.

             Nance is going to play a lot of power forward and center for the Cavs, especially with Kevin Love out. He's giving the Cavs a much-needed defensive presence and it looks like he'll be worth owning across the board. He was much better tonight than in his Cleveland debut and is returning eighth- or ninth-round fantasy value on the season.

             His minutes and numbers have dwindled in each of his last three games and it's probably time to think about dumping him if you picked him up. The Cavs are at full strength and guys like Larry Nance, Jeff Green, Jordan Clarkson and Rodney Hood, who all come off the bench, are going to make it tough for Osman to succeed for much longer.

             Teague isn't usually this aggressive on offense, but the Wolves needed him to be with Jimmy Butler and Andrew Wiggins' shots not falling. Teague also dished out eight assists with five rebounds and two triples, and coach Tom Thibodeau didn't want to take him off the floor -- he played 38 minutes compared to 10 for Tyus Jones. He'll try to keep it going against the Lakers on Thursday, a team that has allowed the second most fantasy points to PGs this season.

             Hill's averaging just 9.5 points, 2.0 rebounds, 2.5 assists and 1.5 3-pointers in 23 minutes in his two games with the Cavs, and it's not all that surprising given how much LeBron James handles the ball. Hill's more of a glorified shooting guard on this team than a point guard, but J.R. Smith has been hot in his last two, negatively impacting Hill. Hill is probably still worth owning as long as he's starting for the Cavs, but expectations should probably be tempered, at least as long as Smith (and LeBron) are so hot.

He was a -25 in his 41 minutes of action and missed his first 12 shots, adding three rebounds, one block and one steal. He did shoot at least 50% from the field in his previous four games, so we'll just chalk this up as an off night. Houston's defense deserves some credit as well. A home game against the Lakers on Thursday should get him going again.

             The Rockets won their ninth straight game tonight and were dominant in the fourth quarter, outscoring the Wolves 42-38. They also outscored the Wolves by 48 points from the 3-point line. The Rockets play the Kings on Wednesday on the second night of a back-to-back, and while there's no indication that Houston will rest anyone, it doesn't hurt to double check CP3's status just in case because he has been banged up quite a bit this season.

            Eric Bledsoe struggled in the first half of Tuesday's 97-92 win over the Hawks, but had a nice second half that included an emphatic dunk over Ersan Ilyasova to help fire up his team and propel them to the win.
        
        
             Bledsoe finished with 14 points, three rebounds, nine assists, a steal, three blocks and two 3-pointers on 5-of-14 shooting in 35 minutes. The three blocks tied his season high and were a bit fluky, as he hasn't blocked a shot in eight of his last 10 games, but he did a little bit of everything tonight, including turned it over six times. Bledsoe is hot over his last five games, averaging 20.4 points, 3.8 rebounds, 7.4 assists, 1.6 steals, 1.0 blocks and 2.2 3-pointers on 54 percent shooting. Milwaukee's won five of their last six games and are currently the No. 4 seed in the East, and Bledsoe is a big part of the equation for their success.

             He needed a big game after scoring a combined 13 points in his last three outings. The Rockets are still starting P.J. Tucker as a small-ball four, and while coach Mike D'Antoni originally called it a matchup decision, it's starting to look like Anderson's demotion could be permanent. The Rockets have added two new faces in Joe Johnson and Brandan Wright and Trevor Ariza (hamstring) is due back after the All-Star break, so big nights like these could be few and far between going forward.

             Ersan Ilyasova is still starting and has gotten about 28 minutes in each of his last three games, but that could be coming to a halt after the All-Star break. It's not set in stone, and Ilyasova could continue to fluster Collins owners, but the Hawks know what Ilyasova can do and need to develop Collins. Hang in there with him and look for him to eventually render Ilyasova useless at some point in the near future.

             Nine of his 10 shot attempts were triples and he connected on three of them, adding one assist in 30 minutes. Outside of his 3-point shooting, we've seen a lot of empty stat lines from him lately with a total of zero steals, two assists and three rebounds in his last three outings. He still has the green light from deep in one of the best offenses in the NBA, so his owners should stick with him. Maybe some fresh legs after the All-Star break will get him going.

             Not only has Dedmon started the last two games, sending Miles Plumlee (maybe permanently) to the bench, but he's double-doubled in both of them and has quietly buried at least one 3-pointer in nine straight. It looks like he might stick in the starting five the rest of the way and he's been pretty brilliant in his last two, averaging 16.5 points, 11.5 rebounds, 2.0 steals, 1.0 blocks and 1.5 3-pointers.

             He's just unstoppable. This was his 19th game of the season with 30+ points, his 20th game with double-digit assists and his 12th game with at least six 3-pointers. He hit 10-of-20 shots and 8-of-9 free throws, giving the Rockets their ninth straight win -- only the Jazz have a longer active winning streak right now (10). Harden will make sure his team gives the Warriors a run for their money for the No. 1 seed out West.

             He's played between 26-28 minutes in three straight games and has played well enough in all three of them to be owned in fantasy right now. However, the Hawks are still in tank mode, John Collins needs to be developed, and Ilyasova is anything but a young player. Feel free to roll with him until wheels fall off, but don't be surprised if that happens in the very near future. The clock is ticking on Ilyasova's value this season and it could run out right after the All-Star break.

             Lowry had been pretty quiet over his previous two games, scoring a total of 19 points and hitting just 6-of-19 shots, but he came back in a big way tonight. Lowry's actually struggled in three of his last five, and a lot of it has to do with the way Fred VanVleet and Delon Wright are playing off the bench. The Raps' bench is one of the best in the league and once those guys come in and get hot, they tend to extend leads and leave Lowry on the bench longer than he might like. But he's still one of the better point guards in the league and his off nights will hopefully be few and far between.

             He came in dealing with a right ankle sprain, but it's hard to tell if the ankle kept him limited, or if it was the fact the Raptors went really small in the fourth quarter to close out the game. DeMar DeRozan was playing PF, Jonas Valanciunas was out there, and guards Kyle Lowry, Fred VanVleet and Delon Wright were also out there together. The Raptors have now won six straight games and carry an East-best 40-16 record into Wednesday's game against the Bulls before taking a break for All-Star Weekend. And for the record, we're guessing OG's ankle is fine and the Raps just decided to go small tonight.

             Johnson went off for 19 points and a fat stat line on Friday, but Dwyane Wade is back in Miami, spelling bad news for Johnson. Wade played 21 minutes for 10 points, 11 rebounds and six assists tonight, and while Johnson will still have some nice lines, he's going to be very inconsistent while trying to compete for minutes with Wade and Wayne Ellington (15 points, seven boards, five 3-pointers).

             Dragic is going to the All-Star Game this weekend and tonight's line is a good example of why. He's also hot right now (for the most part), scoring between 33 and 28 points in three of his last five games.

             Whiteside didn't play in the fourth quarter again and this is becoming a broken record. Bam Adebayo has been getting those minutes, while Kelly Olynyk also gets some of them when he's healthy enough to play. Despite the Heat limiting his minutes, Whiteside is still averaging 14.3 points, 14.3 rebounds, 0.8 steals and 0.5 blocks over his last four games, double-doubling in each of them. Whiteside is too good a player to be permanently sent to the doghouse, but we do worry about him staying motivated if frustrations over playing time continue to build.

             J-Rich came through with the fantasy gold with the steal, blocks and threes, but the 10 points were his lowest total since Jan. 25. The key is that Richardson's minutes haven't changed at all with the arrival of Dwyane Wade and he should be locked and loaded for a big finish to the season. And really, outside of his shooting and low scoring, there's a ton to love about his line tonight.

Fantasy owners are better off looking elsewhere for value and we still expect plenty of DNPs for Parsons the rest of the way.

Omri Casspi started in place of Green on Monday and posted a strong double-double, finishing with 19 points and 10 rebounds in 27 minutes.

             Ariza has already been ruled out of Tuesday's game vs. the Wolves. He will remain sidelined for Wednesday's matchup vs. Sacramento. Coach D'Antoni told reporters that Ariza ""could probably return"" from his strained hamstring, but ""with no real practice time and the break coming after [Wednesday's) game,"" the Rockets will hold him out. P.J. Tucker and Luc Mbah a Moute will continue to log additional minutes.

He can be left on waivers.

I hate to tell a guy to quit shooting because he is a good shooter, but he’s going to have to mix it up."" He's shooting a mere 25.8 percent over New York's past seven games, and owners in category-based leagues should probably keep him benched while he's struggling this badly.

             Nurkic has had a few days to rest after leaving Sunday's game, but with three distinct injuries and just one game remaining before the All-Star break, Portland might just hold him out. Doing so would give him another 10 days of rest. Ed Davis should start at center if Nurk can't play, with Zach Collins picking up the reserve minutes.

             Ball went through part of Tuesday's practice and ""looked good,"" but L.A. will play it safe since he still felt ""a little bit of discomfort."" This also makes it unlikely that Ball will play in the Rising Stars game during All-Star weekend, but coach Luke Walton added that it's not his decision to make. Josh Hart and Isaiah Thomas should soak up Ball's minutes in L.A.'s upcoming back-to-back set.

            Former Bucks PG Brandon Jennings has been signed by the G League's Wisconsin Herd.
        
        
             Wisconsin had the No. 1 waiver claim so we're not reading into the fact that they're the Bucks' affiliate. Jennings most recently played in China for the Shanxi Brave Dragons, averaging 27.8 points on 47.1% shooting, 6.8 assists and 5.1 rebounds. Even if he is called up from the G League, it would require a perfect situation for him to have fantasy value.

             Murray had 12 points, four assists and three rebounds in 29 minutes on Monday, and there was no sign of a setback with his ankle. Tony Parker (back) isn't even on the injury report, so presumably the Spurs' backcourt will be at full strength.

             The veteran has sat out the second half of the past three back-to-back sets for which he was healthy, and he's coming off a 22-minute performance on Monday. It's unclear why the Spurs would add him to the injury report if he wasn't being rested -- perhaps he'll be in uniform and technically 'available' but won't leave the bench. He's someone to avoid tonight.

             The Celtics first game after the break is February 23rd vs. Detroit, and it appears that Smart is on track to return for that contest. Terry Rozier has played very well over the last couple of weeks, and Smart may see slightly fewer minutes off the bench going forward as a result.

He did not practice on Monday, but it was reported that he passed cognitive tests and had no symptoms of a concussion. We should have an update following Wednesday morning's shootaround. Satoransky scored a career-high 25 points and added three rebounds, six assists, two steals and five 3-pointers in 37 minutes on Saturday before leaving the game.

Hoiberg said that if Dunn did play Wednesday, he would be on a minutes limit. The good news is that Dunn should be ready to rock once the Bulls return from the All-Star break next week. Go grab him now if he's still floating around your league's waiver wire.

Over his last five games in Cleveland, Rose averaged just 3.2 points and 1.4 assists in 11.4 minutes, while shooting just 16.0 percent from the floor.

Williams appeared in just four games and scored a total of five points for Houston this season, but will reportedly receive interest as a free agent.

            Brandon Jennings reportedly signed a G-League contract on Tuesday.
        
        
             Jennings played for China Shanxi this season but is now back from overseas. Jennings played the second half of 2016-17 season with the Wizards, but averaged just 3.5 points in 16.3 minutes, while shooting 27.4 percent from the floor. He'll try to land a 10-day contract from an NBA team looking for point guard depth.

            Coach Frank Vogel said that Aaron Gordon (hip) is unlikely to play Wednesday vs. the Hornets.
        
        
             Gordon has missed eight straight games, and sitting him on Wednesday is an easy decision for Orlando. He's technically listed as 'questionable', but remaining out through the All-Star break would give Gordon an extra ten days of rest. Also, Orlando should be focused on improving its draft positioning at this point in the season. Mario Hezonja, who is playing the best ball of his career of late, will continue to soak up extra minutes with Gordon sidelined.

             Vucevic fractured his left hand on Dec. 23 and has missed each of the 22 games Orlando has played since. However, he plans on returning to game action next Thursday, when the Magic host the Knicks. ""I expect to be back against the Knicks, so I’ll stay in Orlando during the break and keep working on my game,"" Vucevic said Monday night. Bismack Biyombo will start just one more game before he is bumped back to the bench. Khem Birch will also see his minutes reduced.

             Whiteside averaged 32.6 minutes per game in 2016-17, but has seen that number drop down to 25.7 this season. ""I’m not going to lie. It’s frustrating. It’s nothing I can really do about it. Just keep a positive attitude. Coach is going to try to do what’s best for the team. He just wants to win. If I am playing 10 less minutes than I played last year, there isn’t much I can do about it."" Whiteside stated that playing alongside Bam Adebayo is a potential solution that appeals to him.

             As NBA contenders began signing players that were bought out after the deadline, there was some buzz that teams might make a run at Diaw. However, it appears he'd prefer to remain in his native France. Players need to sign by March 1st in order to be eligible for the NBA postseason.

Okafor earning a spot in the New Orleans rotation after taking three years off is a great story, but his fantasy value is minimal due to his limited minutes. He can be left on waivers.

He's off to a great start in Phoenix, but we may not see how he fits next to Devin Booker (hip) until after the break.

             Casspi was great and is worth a streaming/DFS look any time Green or Kevin Durant are sitting out, but Green's expected back on Wednesday.

Steph Curry added 22 points, nine boards, seven assists and three 3-pointers and Klay Thompson had 16 points and two 3-pointers on a night Draymond Green was out with a sprained left index finger.

            Royce O'Neale played a career-high 38 minutes in Monday's win over the Spurs, scoring eight points with three rebounds and one turnover.
        
        
             It was a quiet night for him on the stat sheet, but you have to love the workload. The Jazz think very highly of him and that likely factored into their decision to trade Rodney Hood and waive Joe Johnson. He had 11 rebounds, six assists, two steals and one block in 33 minutes on Sunday, so just keep an eye on him.

             Favors hit an efficient 6-of-9 from the field, adding 7-of-10 free throws in just 25 minutes. He won't be an elite fantasy asset as long as Rudy Gobert is healthy, but he's been getting the job done for his fantasy owners during Utah's 10-game winning streak with averages of 12.3 points, 8.5 rebounds, 1.4 steals and 1.1 blocks, returning top-80 value in 9-category leagues in that span.

             He was playing well with nine points in eight minutes and just got clearance to play from his sprained left thumb. If he misses time, Nick Young will likely pick up a handful of minutes.

            Joe Ingles kept his foot on the gas vs. the Spurs on Monday, scoring 20 points with seven rebounds, five assists, four triples and one steal in 39 minutes.
        
        
             Once again, it was Donovan Mitchell and Ingles running most of the offense with Ricky Rubio (hip) missing his second straight contest. He was on fire coming into tonight's game, and while Mitchell is getting all the headlines, Ingles has been a monster too with a +/- rating of +142 in his previous nine games, shooting 60.45 from the field and 59.3% from the line in that span.

            Donovan Mitchell scored 25 points in a 101-99 comeback win over the Spurs, giving the Jazz their 10th straight win.
        
        
             He's been the Jazz's leading scorer during the 10-game win streak, becoming the first rookie since Wilt Chamberlain to accomplish that. Mitchell only hit 9-of-28 shots and 4-of-6 free throws, but racked up seven rebounds, five assists, three steals and three triples. He was also clutch down the stretch, helping the Jazz claw their way back from a double-digit deficit with 13 points and two dimes in the fourth quarter. He's giving Ben Simmons a run for his money in the Rookie of the Year race and is going to be flying off draft boards in the early rounds next season.

             Dejounte Murray is the starting point guard for the reeling Spurs (losers of four of their last five), meaning Parker has no fantasy value these days.

             Green hit a big 3-pointer to give the Spurs a late lead, but Donovan Mitchell stole the ball from Manu Ginobili and the Spurs totally botched their final possession, as Kyle Anderson couldn't figure out what to do with the ball. Ginobili almost hit a circus shot to win it while falling out of bounds, but it didn't go in. Green had just four points in 22 minutes on Saturday and tends to follow good games with bad ones, which is why he's likely available in your league.

             Murray has quieted down over his last few games, but should be ready to get hot again as long as he can stay healthy. He's a borderline hold right now, but only drop him if you're picking up a sure thing off the wire.

             The Jazz pulled off a nice comeback behind Donovan Mitchell's and Derrick Favors' big fourth quarters and held on to beat the reeling Spurs, who have lost two straight and four of their last five. Gasol was off to a rough start this month, failing to score more than eight points in his previous four games, but looked great tonight with LaMarcus Aldridge (knee) in street clothes. Aldridge will be out on Tuesday so Gasol should have another big opportunity, but he'll have to play in order for that to happen. Watch the newsfeed to make sure he's good to go, as anything's possible under coach Gregg Popovich.

             Bertans played 31 minutes on Saturday and 26 minutes in his previous game, and LaMarcus Aldridge (knee) will be out again on Tuesday.

             The Magic were getting run out of the building, but their second unit brought them back into the game and coach Frank Vogel stuck with Shelvin Mack down the stretch. Augustin has now had one really good game to go with two duds, so he'll be back on the waiver wire soon if he doesn't sort things out. His owners should probably give him another chance unless there's a really hot free agent available like a Mario Hezonja.

And when those two things happen, Grant will certainly be taking a hit.

            Mario Hezonja went off again on Monday, scoring 24 points vs. the Bulls in a 105-101 loss.
        
        
             The Magic clawed their way back from an 18-point deficit in the fourth quarter only for Jonathon Simmons to turn the ball over on an inbounds pass on their second to last possession with the game tied. As for Hezonja, he was using cheat codes on Monday, racking up six rebounds, four steals, three blocks and three triples on 8-of-14 shooting. He's been a second-round value in standard leagues over the past two weeks with Aaron Gordon (hip) out, averaging 16.4 points, 5.1 rebounds, 1.8 assists, 1.9 steals, 0.8 blocks and 2.5 triples. The Magic are probably are kicking themselves for declining his player option.

             Had his threes been falling his line would have been scary, but this was just the fifth time all season that he failed to sink one from beyond the arc. Markkanen should continue to roll for the Bulls, especially with Niko Mirotic out of his way.

             He'd missed his previous two games with a foot injury, but was back at it tonight. Milos takes a hit now that Austin Rivers is back, but he should still get serviceable minutes going as long as he can stay healthy. But there is a slew of other point guards we'd rather own now that the Clippers are nearly back at full strength.

Simmons was 6-of-8 from the field and 1-of-2 from the line in 33 minutes while leading the 76ers to their fourth straight win. He's quickly becoming a superstar in fantasy and in real life.

             Yuck. After collecting eight rebounds in back-to-back games, Bradley didn't even have one tonight and if you're sick of dealing with his mediocrity this season, dropping him is certainly on the table. And there is no way we thought we'd be writing that about Bradley this season, but the fact remains he's been one of the most disappointing players in all of fantasy this season.

             What a night for McConnell. He matched his career-high with six steals and hit 5-of-11 shots in 37 minutes, and when he collected his final rebound with about a minute left the home crowd just erupted. He became the first Philadelphia player to ever post a triple-double off the bench and he's firmly on the radar as a pickup since the 76ers have four more games in Weeks 18 and 19 combined (one more this week and three next week). The addition of Marco Belinelli could hurt his value a bit, though.

             He has just eight double-doubles on the season, but two of them have come in his last three games. The Nets are tanking and could soon turn to a youth movement, but Carroll has played well enough in his last five games to be held, averaging 14.8 points, 7.2 rebounds, 2.2 assists, 0.6 steals, 0.4 blocks and 2.8 3-pointers, despite shooting just 37 percent.

             He was a -18 in his 19 minutes and did more harm than good for his fantasy owners, hitting 3-of-7 shots and 1-of-4 free throws with one turnover. He's no stranger to efficiency problems, but we're going to see a lot of both Mudiay and Frank Ntilikina down the stretch -- coach Jeff Hornacek said he will make a lineup change after the All-Star break and wants to get the younger players more involved.

             He came off the bench behind Emeka Okafor, who started at center to try to help Anthony Davis with Andre Drummond, but still came up big with his second straight dub-dub, and third in his last five games. Starting or coming off the bench really doesn't matter for Mirotic, and he's averaging 15.4 points, 9.6 rebounds, 1.6 steals, 1.2 blocks and 2.2 3-pointers over his last five games.

             He might be one of the least exciting players in terms of fantasy. This was a temporary matchup move and Thomas will likely come off the bench on Wednesday. Unless you're tanking your fantasy league, leave Thomas on the wire.

             He didn't hit a 3-pointer but the 12 dimes were a season high and he racked up his third double-double of the season tonight. The Pelicans are a much better team on nights when both Holiday and Rajon Rondo are playing well, and have won two straight games with both of them (and Anthony Davis) hot.

             KOQ was actually listed as a starter tonight, but coach Jeff Hornacek changed his mind and stuck with Michael Beasley next to Enes Kanter. KOQ is still Kanter's primary backup, but Luke Kornet might leapfrog him in the rotation soon.

             No, it didn't compare to his monster 25-10-12 line on Saturday, but it wasn't too bad. Rondo's been playing well of late, averaging 13 points, 5.0 rebounds, 8.2 assists and 1.4 3-pointers on 56 percent shooting over his last five and did his owners a favor by not shooting any free throws tonight. He's hit just four of his last 12 freebies, but is playing well enough to be rostered everywhere.

             The Knicks were considering a lineup change tonight with Kyle O'Quinn next to Enes Kanter, but coach Hornacek ultimately changed his mind and Beasley made his third straight start. He grabbed five rebounds with two assists, two blocks and two triples in 39 minutes and continues to look like a must-own player with Kristaps Porzingis (knee) out for the season.

             Okafor was put into action so that Anthony Davis wouldn't have to deal with Andre Drummond by himself and did an admirable job. He's played in three games after taking three years off and while his numbers haven't been too bad, he's not really an add in fantasy. Just keep your eye on him in case the Pelicans decide to use him more than 15-20 minutes a night. If you would have told us that Emeka Okafor would be better than Jahlil Okafor in 2018, we would have sent you to a psychiatrist.

             Davis got a break with Okafor around, not having to face Andre Drummond head-to-head, and came through with a monster line, as usual. Actually, Davis had a bit of a rough time last week when he scored 15 & 14 points in back-to-back games, but has bounced back to average 41 points, 13.5 rebounds, 2.5 blocks, 3.5 steals and 3.0 3-pointers over his last two.

He's been trending down and may have bottomed out tonight, but there's also a chance he could bounce back against the Hawks on Valentine's Day. Either way, you can probably find a more reliable player on your waiver wire than Tolliver.

             Drummond has been a rebounding monster for a few weeks now, as this was his fifth 20-rebound game over his last 11 played. The Pelicans actually started Emeka Okafor to help deal with Drummond and Blake Griffin, and the plan appears to have worked since New Orleans got the 118-103 win. The Pistons have finally cooled off, losing three straight after winning five straight after acquiring Griffin.

Okafor is nothing more than a temporary streaming option in very deep leagues and it's anybody's guess as to how many minutes he plays. As for Mirotic, he'll be just fine and remains a must-start option.

It sounds like coach Jeff Hornacek wants to play his younger guys more after the All-Star break, so this isn't a lineup that will last for long. With KOQ starting next to Kanter, that could allow Luke Kornet to be one of the first bigs off the bench along with Beasley.

             Based on coach Jeff Hornacek's comments, this is likely a short-term move because he wants Thomas to defend Ben Simmons tonight. If you're relying on Thomas in fantasy, your team is in shambles.RotoGrinders.com Daily Slant: Kyle O'Quinn and Enes Kanter are starting against the Sixers front-court, which means we'll see Beasley coming off the bench along with Courtney Lee. Beasley is still squarely on the DFS radar as his playing time may not change much, but he does carry some added risk at this point. Kanter dropped a 31-22 game on Philly last time these teams met (with Embiid in action), and he was already squarely on the radar as an upside play.

             The Wizards have been a linked to several PGs including Derrick Rose, Donald Sloan and Briante Weber. It sounds like Tomas Satoransky (head) is probable to play on Wednesday, while Tim Frazier's (nasal fracture) status is up in the air. Lawson could see minutes if he signs with Washington, but Satoransky is still the PG to own in fantasy. The 30-year-old Lawson has spent the season playing overseas in China.

             Maybe he suffered a setback, but the Bucks aren't going to take any chances this close to the All-Star break. Thon Maker and Tyler Zeller will fill the void left by Henson, but neither player can be trusted in standard leagues. We may also see Giannis Antetokounmpo play some center minutes like he's done many times this season.

             Backup PG Raul Neto only played 15 minutes on Sunday, so he didn't really benefit without Rubio. Donovan Mitchell (27 points) and Joe Ingles (24 points, six triples, four assists) ran most of the offense and we expect to see more of the same on Monday. Both are strong plays in all formats.RotoGrinders.com Daily Slant: Royce O'Neale started for Rubio with Donovan Mitchell doing most of the ball-handling, but it was O'Neale that ended up leading the team in assists last night (6) while Raul Neto racked up five and Joe Ingles four. O'Neale carried a miniscule 9.2% usage rate last night and he's not likely to garner much more tonight even with similar court time, as the other four starters will eat up most of what Rubio leaves behind in that regard. Mitchell had a 34.4% usage rate with Ingles at 21.6%, Favors at 20.9% and Gobert at 18.0%.

The Lakers will practice again on Tuesday and will see how he feels before determining his status for Wednesday's game vs. the Pelicans. Even with Isaiah Thomas around, the Lakers have made it very clear that Ball is the starter, but we could see a lot of two-PG lineups.

That's another reason why Dwight Powell is trending up.

Miles had a monster game on Sunday with 24 points and six triples in 18 minutes, while Powell flopped with two points, two rebounds and two assists in 16 minutes.

             He's been getting minutes in the low teens lately and just got back from the G-League. There are no real fantasy implications here, but Nick Young could get some more run if McCaw is out.

             This means we won't see him again until after the All-Star break. ""He's just getting a treatment on his knee,"" coach Gregg Popovich said. ""There's a certain amount of rest that has to happen. He's doing it now so he won't have to miss any games after the break."" With Aldridge out, Davis Bertans should get plenty of burn over the next two games and is worth a look as a streaming option for his 3-point shooting. He's also on the radar in DFS.

             He was considered doubtful and this is a game that the Warriors should be able to win comfortably with Devin Booker sitting out for the Suns. The last time Green missed a game, Kevon Looney played 30 minutes and didn't do much with them, scoring two points with four boards and one assist. Omri Casspi, David West and Andre Iguodala are also candidates to see a bump in minutes, but there's no clear beneficiary.

             Most of the practice was non-contact work and coach Billy Donovan wouldn't commit to Melo playing on Tuesday vs. the Cavaliers.

Coach Billy Donovan didn't update Westbrook's status for Tuesday's game vs. the Cavaliers, but added that it will be determined after the morning shootaround. If he's out, expect Paul George to carry the Thunder with Raymond Felton providing low-end fantasy numbers as the fill-in starter.

             He didn't practice on Monday, but he did have three stitches and it sounds like he was held out as a precaution. For now, he should be considered probable for Wednesday's game vs. the Knicks. The Wizards may bring in another PG on a 10-day deal, but Satoransky is the guy you want to own in fantasy.

             He had surgery to repair a stress fracture in his left tibia during the preseason and has been rehabbing ever since. McGruder was a big part of Miami's rotation in 2017-18, playing 25.2 minutes per game with 6.4 points, 3.3 rebounds, 1.6 assists, 0.6 steals and 0.9 triples. He had a lot more value in real life than in fantasy for his defense and energy, and it's unclear how many minutes he can carve out in Miami's crowded wing rotation this time around.

             As expected, Olynyk will not return before the All-Star break. The Heat are still not providing a timetable, so there's no guarantee that he will be cleared right away after the break. Bam Adebayo has been awesome and the Heat have used him next to Hassan Whiteside, so expect to see more of that. Justise Winslow and James Johnson also get a bump with this news.

             He will sign his paperwork a couple hours before tip-off and it's just a matter of whether or not they can get it done in time. Belinelli will be a solid addition to Philly's second unit, but it will be interesting to see who takes minutes away from. He's not a fantasy pickup for now.

Portland is off until Wednesday's game vs. the Warriors, but we'll consider him questionable for that contest. If he sits, Ed Davis and Zach Collins would likely hold down the fort at center for the Blazers.

So I know how to handle myself and how to be ready at all times, and that’s something I pride myself on: just being ready for whatever I need to do to help the team win."" Augustin has made two starts since the Magic dumped Elfrid Payton, putting up one strong game with 18 points, nine assists, two steals and two 3-pointers and one dud with 11 points on 2-of-7 shooting. He'll get a great matchup vs. the Bulls on Monday, so look for him to bounce back.

             ""You see the moves he can do to get past guys,’’ Hornacek said. ""Once he gets more familiar with our players and guys understand, ‘Hey, get open because he’s going to get it to you.’ I said beforehand, if he’s playing well, we’ll let him stay in there. I thought he had good court sense, made some great passes.’’ Mudiay finished with 14 points, 10 assists and two turnovers in 29 minutes, playing 28 of those minutes next to Frank Ntilikina. It also sounds like the Knicks will make a lineup change after the break to get Mudiay and Ntilikina more involved at the expense of Jarrett Jack.

             ""When we bring in another point guard and young kid in Emmanuel, we have to look at things,"" Hornacek said. ""We have a couple more games before the break. Then when we come back, we have a few practices before that first game. If we’re going to do something, that will be the time."" Jarrett Jack played just eight minutes in the starting lineup on Sunday and is an obvious candidate to move to the bench. He can be dropped in most leagues, as the Knicks are planning to take a long look at both Frank Ntilikina and Emmanuel Mudiay.

He's limited to work on an AlterG antigravity treadmill for now, and based on his original timetable of 6-8 weeks, we won't see him on the court again until mid-March at the earliest.

Payton finished with 19 points, nine assists and six rebounds over 35 minutes, but it's going to be interesting to see how he fits next to a ball-dominant Devin Booker.

             ""I think it’s just being back in the rotation,’’ Harkless said. ""It’s hard to not know if you are going to play, how much you are going to play, then get thrown out there for six minutes. It’s tough to play like that and be consistent.’’ After falling out of the rotation for a while, Harkless has started four games in a row with averages of 8.5 points, 3.3 rebounds, 1.3 assists, 1.0 steals, 0.5 blocks and 0.8 triples. Damian Lillard said the Blazers ""are a completely different team,"" when Harkless plays well, but he's just someone for fantasy owners to keep an eye on for now.

            Jazz GM Dennis Lindsey is optimistic that Jae Crowder will find his form in Utah.
        
        
             ""He’s really versatile defensively and can play really two through four with switches and physicality,"" Lindsey said. ""His build is quite obvious and the systems that he’s played in with Dallas, Boston and Cleveland, we’ve seen enough to think that he can mesh very well in how we play."" He had 15 points, five rebounds, three assists, three 3-pointers and one steal in 29 minutes on Sunday and gets a fresh start after a disappointing stint in Cleveland. Joe Ingles and Royce O'Neale are playing well, but Crowder's ability to play multiple positions should help him carve out a nice role. We'll see if he can keep it going.

             It's unclear how Nurkic got hurt and we should have more clarity on Monday or Tuesday. Portland only plays once prior to the All-Star break, so it's possible they'll hold Nurkic out on Wednesday to give him a full 12 days to recuperate. If he does miss Wednesday's game vs. the Warriors, Ed Davis and Zach Collins would pick up the slack.

Lillard's tank was full tonight but it wasn't enough to avoid a lopsided home loss, and Portland will try to regroup vs. the Warriors on Wednesday. After that, they're off until Feb. 23.

             The Blazers' eight-game home win streak was snapped and the only player who really had it going was Damian Lillard (39 points). The Blazers were quiet at the trade deadline, only making one financially-motivated move by unloading Noah Vonleh, so they need guys like Lillard and McCollum to carry the load as they battle for playoff position. Despite this rough shooting night, McCollum is well-situated for fantasy purposes.

             Ingles had just established a career high in scoring on Friday with 23 points, and it didn't take him long to exceed that mark. He was particularly good in the third quarter, helping the Jazz open up a big second-half lead, and his renewed aggression is part of the reason Utah has reeled off nine straight victories. He shouldn't be on the waiver wire, especially with Rodney Hood and Joe Johnson both out of the picture.

             Favors appeared to tweak his right ankle in the second quarter, but he played through it. We'll leave him off the injury report but owners should double-check his status prior to tip-off vs. the Spurs on Monday. He collected four of his boards on the offensive end tonight, and turned the ball over just once in 31 minutes, and all signs point to him starting alongside Rudy Gobert the rest of the way.

             O'Neale got the nod in place of Ricky Rubio (left hip) tonight, which bumped Donovan Mitchell to point guard. There's a chance Utah will play it safe and hold Rubio out through the All-Star break, but for now we're considering him day-to-day. O'Neale has been impressive during Utah's current win streak but there should be safer free agents on most waiver wires.

             Crowder was a disappointment in Cleveland this season, so the change of scenery should be viewed as a positive for fantasy purposes. This was the seventh time all season he's reached the 15-point plateau and he looks like a great fit in Utah. ""I truly believe this will work well,"" Crowder said before the game. ""Right when I came in the door ... I felt this could be home for a long time."" Most owners can just watch his role prior to the All-Star break, but he's worth grabbing in deeper leagues.

             Kanter resumed his usual starting center role, which meant Kyle O'Quinn moved to the bench. His scoring and rebounding are more important than ever for New York, and his role looks iron-clad with Kristaps Porzingis injured, Willy Hernangomez traded away, and Joakim Noah effectively banished.

             Gasol, the steadying veteran presence in Grind City, remains the centerpiece in the Memphis offense. The team has him under contract for at least one more season and they were not interested in moving him at the trade deadline. That's bad news for the likes of Deyonta Davis, JaMychal Green and Jarell Martin, who will have to bide their time until the logjam in the frontcourt is broken up.

             Rabb and Jarell Martin were seeing plenty of minutes off the bench with Deyonta Davis (knee) on the shelf. While Rabb was productive in his limited time, and he did not turn it over, he is still only worth a look as a low-end fantasy option in the deepest of formats at this point.

             Martin was back to the bench with Tyreke Evans (wrist) healthy and returning from a five-game absence, but the former LSU Tigers standout was still effective. In fact, his 10 rebounds were a season high and tied for his most since he snagged 12 boards on Nov. 28, 2016. However, as long as Evans is healthy he remains useful only in the deepest of fantasy formats.

             It's unclear when Nurkic was injured tonight and his return is less likely with Portland trailing by 18 points heading into the fourth quarter. Ed Davis and Zach Collins stand to gain if Nurkic misses more time.

His playing time has been a bit erratic lately, and even when he has had extended run he hasn't shot the ball particularly well. His fantasy appeal is limited to the deepest of formats until further notice.

             Brooks was able to add four rebounds and four assists in the start, but he also turned it over a season-high five times before fouling out. The poor game snapped a season-high eight-game run with 10 or more points. He has been a decent low-end fantasy option in deeper leagues lately, but he needs to take better care of the basketball to be successful.

             Harrison was returning from illness, but it was the referee's whistle and not any kind of setback which kept him on the bench. Harrison picked up five personals in rather quick fashion, so it was Ben McLemore seeing a bump in playing time with Harrison languishing on the bench.

             Anderson has attempted double-digit shot attempts just once over the past month, which is an indication of his role -- he hovers on the perimeter as a catch-and-shoot option. A near-total lack of supporting stats also undermines his fantasy value, but we'll give him credit for committing zero turnovers in February, a span of 123 minutes.

             This was Powell's second double-double of the season. He benefited from the absence of Dirk Nowitzki, who missed his first game of the season due to swelling in his left ankle. Dirk's role isn't guaranteed over the final 25 games of a rebuilding season, and Powell stands to gain whenever the veteran is limited. He's providing value in most formats even with Nowitzki active, so this is just one more reason to add him.

            Yogi Ferrell started in place of Wes Matthews (back) on Sunday, scoring a team-high 20 points on 7-of-14 shooting with four 3-pointers, five rebounds, three steals and one assist.
        
        
             Ferrell hit both of his free throws and didn't commit a single turnover in 34 minutes, leading an impressive effort from the short-handed Mavs. His role should increase as Dallas emphasizes their younger players down the stretch, but Ferrell comes with a big asterisk -- he's shooting just 42.9% from the field this season, and has dropped to 37.3% over the past month.

                      - G -  Mavericks
                
                 
            
        
        
        
            Kyle Collinsworth looked good in 31 minutes on Sunday, scoring six points with eight rebounds, five assists, two blocks and one steal in a loss vs. Houston.
        
        
             The 26-year-old rookie was pressed into a big role because Dallas only had nine healthy players tonight. He's emerged as a steady presence in the rotation and is worth monitoring in deep leagues, but most owners can ignore him while J.J. Barea (rest) and Wes Matthews (back) are in the picture.

            Dennis Smith Jr. notched his fourth double-double of the season on Sunday, scoring 16 points with a career-high 11 assists in 35 minutes.
        
        
             DSJ added five rebounds, two 3-pointers and one steal tonight, but he also shot 7-of-18 from the field with six turnovers. Dirk Nowitzki (ankle), Wesley Matthews (back) and J.J. Barea (rest) were all sidelined tonight and we got a glimpse of the future with Smith Jr. consistently leading the Mavs' attack. He continues to destroy roto owners from an efficiency standpoint, but his rest-of-season outlook is terrific in points leagues.

            Jamal Crawford ended up with 12 points over 22 minutes off the bench in Sunday's 111-106 win against the Kings.
        
        
             Crawford hit 3-of-7 from the field, including 3-of-6 from behind the 3-point line. He led the team off the pine, as his three other benchmates totaled just nine points over 43 minutes. The 3-pointer specialist is working on a five-game streak with at least one triple, and he has a trey in nine of his past 10 since returning from a toe injury in mid-January.

            Jimmy Butler finished Sunday's 111-106 win against the Kings with 18 points, five rebounds, three assists and two steals over 39 minutes.
        
        
             Butler's stat line wasn't bad, but it was a far cry from the 38 points he posted in his emotional return to Chicago on Friday, going head-to-head with Zach LaVine and his old teammates. He still finished 5-of-9 from the field, 1-of-1 from the 3-point line and 7-of-9 from the free-throw stripe, but it was his first time under 20 points over the past 20 games dating back to Jan. 12.

            Jeff Teague ended up with 12 points and 10 assists over 32 minutes in Sunday's 111-106 win against the Kings.
        
        
             It was the 10th double-double of the season for Teague, who also tacked on three steals and a rebound while posting a 3-pointer. He has reached 10 assists on 14 different occasions, with three of those outings coming across the past seven games dating back to Jan. 29. Teague is also working on a six-game streak with at least one 3-pointer, one short of tying a season best.

            Taj Gibson posted 15 points with six rebounds over 32 minutes in Sunday's win against the Kings.
        
        
             Gibson was a solid 6-of-11 from the field, and 3-of-3 from the free-throw stripe, but he saw a few less minutes due to foul trouble. That led to Nemanja Bjelica seeing some extra run, though he did nothing with the opportunity. Gibson is averaging 11.5 points, 6.3 rebounds and 1.0 blocked shots per game over his past four outings. He has turned in mid-round fantasy value for a good chunk of the season.
